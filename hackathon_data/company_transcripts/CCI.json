Welcome to the Crown Castle International First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Ben Lowe, Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.","Ben Lowe","Great. Thank you, Hannah, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our first quarter 2018 results. With me on the call this morning are Jay Brown, Crown Castle\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.","This call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors sections of the Company\u2019s SEC filings. Our statements are made as of today, April 19, 2018, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","In addition, today\u2019s call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investors section of the Company\u2019s website at crowncastle.com.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Brown","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our press release last night, we delivered another great quarter of solid results, and 2018 remains on track to be another great year for Crown Castle, which Dan will discuss in greater detail in a few minutes. I\u2019d like to spend my time highlighting three themes we are seeing in the business, which are noted on Slide 3: increased leasing activity; fiber repeating the success of towers; and the early signs of potential future opportunities, including 5G.","On the first theme, so far this year, we are seeing accelerating leasing activity across towers and fiber as the rapid growth in data is driving demand for our shared infrastructure assets. This acceleration can be seen in our 2018 outlook for growth compared to the rate of growth last year. Our unique portfolio of towers and fiber located in the top markets provides the essential infrastructure needed for wireless network deployment. In our tower business during the last 12 months, we\u2019ve seen increasing leasing activity and have signed comprehensive leasing agreements with several of our top customers. These agreements speak to the value of our unique assets and capabilities and signal the beginning of a sustained period of network investment by our customers that will drive future growth.","Like towers, fiber has become an essential component to wireless networks, as evidenced by the increasing demand for small cells. As yet another proof point, we booked as many small cells in the first quarter as we did in all of 2016. As a result, our pipeline of nodes to be constructed increased to more than 30,000. Typically, we complete the construction of nodes in 18 months to 24 months after booking. Even more encouraging and answering one of the most common questions we receive on small cells, over 50% of the nodes booked during the first quarter are for co-location on existing fiber infrastructure, driving higher returns.","Both the volume of activity and the returns we are generating on our fiber investments further validate our strategic pursuit of this expanding opportunity. This is reminiscent to me of the early days of towers. We\u2019re seeing demand from multiple tenants on the same fiber, driving high incremental margins that grow our returns over time. And we aren\u2019t surprised by this level of demand because we intentionally focused our fiber investments primarily in the top 25 markets, where we expect to see the greatest demand for small cells.","While towers and fiber share many of the same attributes, there are some important differences. For example, we\u2019re seeing demand for our fiber from more than our wireless customers, thus, increasing the diversity of our customer mix. It is a compelling opportunity to improve the already attractive shared economic model by providing fiber solutions that serve high-bandwidth customers who need access to fiber. When compared to small cell deployments, fiber solution opportunities tend to have faster payback periods on invested capital that occur within the initial contract term, compensating for the higher anticipated churn. The combination of small cells and fiber solutions translate into a larger addressable market of opportunities that are accretive to long-term returns we are generating across our fiber investments.","Looking at two of our markets helps to illustrate both the success to date and the opportunity in front of us. In Phoenix, we\u2019re generating an 11% recurring yield on approximately $70 million of invested capital, with small cells driving the entire return on the fiber investment. In Philadelphia, we\u2019re generating a similar 11% recurring yield from a combination of small cells and fiber solutions on approximately $700 million of invested capital, inclusive of recent acquisitions. Obviously, those returns are very attractive, meaningfully exceeding our cost of capital. And I believe there\u2019s additional opportunity to grow cash flows from both small cells and fiber solutions as we market those products.","With that strategy in mind, we are making very good progress on integrating our recent fiber acquisitions. We expect the integrations to be largely completed by early next year. Another difference between towers and fiber is the returns we\u2019re generating on our fiber investments, which are scaling faster than what we experience with towers. In the early days of towers, we invested speculatively in new towers without anchor tenants, which contributed to approximately 3% initial yields on average across the business.","In small cells, we are not investing speculatively, and we\u2019re generating 6% to 7% initial yields on our investments. Additionally, with towers, we have historically added the equivalent of one additional tenant per tower across our portfolio over a 10-year period of time. With fiber, we\u2019re seeing small cell lease-up occur at nearly twice that pace, with the second tenant added on average within five years. Plus we have the added opportunity to put fiber solutions on the same fiber, as I mentioned before.","To illustrate this point, we\u2019re generating a recurring yield of approximately 9% across the $23 billion we have invested in towers. That capital has a weighted average life of approximately nine years. By comparison, we\u2019re generating a recurring yield of approximately 8% on the $12 billion of capital we\u2019ve invested in fiber, with a weighted average life that is approximately two years. We expect these growth trends that I\u2019m speaking about to continue and the returns to hold. And if they do, we will pursue additional investments over time to increase our fiber asset base and expand our long-term opportunity. Those investments will likely take the form of new organic fiber builds with contracted revenue because the opportunity to acquire dense metro fiber with high strand counts in top markets is limited at this point.","The third and final theme relates to our role in the rapidly expanding digital world. We continue to underwrite our investments based on existing applications and technologies. However, with 5G standards expected later this year and as noted on Slide 4, all four of our wireless customers discussing plans to deploy 5G, upside relative to our assumptions, is becoming more likely. The network infrastructure needed to support next-generation services, including those enabled by 5G, has the potential to dramatically increase the demand profile for our tower and fiber assets.","Industry estimates suggest that the current use cases associated with 5G networks will require a tenfold increase in network performance, as measured by latency, reliability and speed. This potential step function change will likely require a hyper-dense network of small cells and fiber and macro sites connected by high-capacity fiber. We are uniquely positioned to benefit given our unmatched portfolio of towers and fiber. These three themes of strong leasing activity, fiber repeating the success of towers and future opportunities from new technologies give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our target of 7% to 8% annual growth in dividends per share.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schlanger","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay discussed, our unique portfolio of assets positions us to take advantage of the positive fundamentals underlying our business. In the near to medium-term, we continue to expect higher new leasing activity in each of towers, small cells and fiber solutions in 2018 as compared to last year. Supporting this view, we recently signed comprehensive leasing agreements with several of our largest customers that lead us to believe we\u2019re in the early stages of a sustained period of investment by those customers.","Additionally, we\u2019ve continued to win substantial small cell bookings, which have added to our pipeline and more than replaced the nodes we have put on air. And we continue to invest heavily in new fiber and small cell assets that set us up well for future growth. As a result, we remain well positioned to build on our track record of delivering compelling total returns to our shareholders through a combination of dividends, new investments and growth.","Turning to first quarter 2018 results. As you can see on Slide 5, we had an outstanding first quarter, exceeding the high end of guidance for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Part of this outperformance was a result of two items that were not contemplated in our prior outlook. First, site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA benefited from approximately $12 million of non-cash revenues associated with the long-term agreements signed with AT&T. Second, AFFO benefited from approximately $11 million of lower sustaining capital expenditures due to timing as those expenditures are now expected to occur later this year. Even adjusting for the impact of these two items, we were able to exceed the midpoint of our prior outlook for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.","From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to improve our financial flexibility while focusing on maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. During the first quarter, we accessed both the debt and equity markets to reduce our leverage, proactively extend maturities and reduce our borrowing costs. We finished the quarter at 5.1 times debt-to-EBITDA and intend to finance the business with approximately five turns of leverage longer-term.","Now turning to Slide 6. As you can see in the chart on the left-hand side of the page, we increased our full year 2018 outlook for site rental revenues by $57 million, which is primarily attributable to this recently signed customer agreements. As we discussed during our last earnings call, our prior 2018 outlook included all the new leasing activity we expected to see from our customers other than what might occur due to the deployment of FirstNet. While we do anticipate an incremental new leasing activity as a result of FirstNet over the course of the next several years, the timing of new leasing in 2018 will not result in significant incremental revenues this year. Therefore, we have not increased our expectations for new leasing activity in 2018, although we have included the straight-line revenues associated with the AT&T agreement in our updated outlook.","Turning to the middle chart on the page. You can see we have increased our full year 2018 outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $48 million, which reflects the impact of the recently signed customer agreements, partially offset by higher anticipated expenses related to the increased activity we are seeing in our business. Finally, as you can see in the chart on the right-hand side of the page, we have increased our 2018 outlook for AFFO by $36 million. This increase is mostly due to the impacts from our March equity offering and lower expected cash taxes, partially offset by the higher anticipated expenses that are impacting adjusted EBITDA as well as an increase in expected floating interest rates when compared to the rates assumed in our prior outlook. Taking all of this into account, the outlook for AFFO per share remains unchanged at approximately $5.50 at the midpoint.","Turning to Slide 7. We expect between $970 million and $1.015 billion in site rental revenue growth from 2017 to 2018. As you can see on the slide, when compared to the prior outlook, the only change is reflected in the floating bar from \u2013 third from the left on the page, namely an increase of $60 million related to the expected change in straight-line revenues that I just discussed.","Moving on to Slide 8. We now expect between $395 million and $435 million in AFFO growth from 2017 to 2018. The only changes when compared to the prior outlook are captured in the other category that covers non-operating items, including changes to interest expense and cash taxes.","In conclusion, first quarter 2018 was another quarter of strong financial and operating performance. For the remainder of 2018, we continue to expect higher new leasing activity across our business. And the recent comprehensive agreements we have signed with several of our customers suggest we are in the early days of a sustained period of investment by those customers. Momentum continues within our fiber business following a quarter in which we booked as many small cells as we did in all of 2016, and we\u2019re making very good progress on integrating our recent fiber acquisitions. All of this supports our goal of increasing our dividend per share by 7% to 8% per year while positioning us for the large potential upside created by 5G that Jay just discussed.","With that, Hannah, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping I could dig in a little bit to some of these moving parts in your guidance. You talked about the higher OpEx. I was hoping you could clarify what\u2019s driving that. Is that unique to the AT&T agreement? Is it more broadly driven by the larger funnel that you have? And then just in general, when are we going to get some visibility into being at a point of sustained level of site operating expenses such that we\u2019ll get a little bit more operating leverage as you grow the business? And then just one quick question we got is, why was your 1Q revenue affected by the new AT&T agreement? I think that was signed after the quarter ended.","Dan Schlanger","Sure, Brett. Thanks for the questions. So the higher OpEx is related to the bigger pipeline of small cells as we continue to build out that pipeline and increase it and increase the velocity of that. We do have to add some OpEx to continue to add to our capabilities to deliver on those nodes. And to your point of when will we see some visibility and when it will kind of slow down, the increase will slow down, it really depends on how quickly we book nodes. If we continue to see increases in the activity levels, we would likely see increases in the OpEx. But we think those are more than made up for by the incremental revenues we\u2019re going to make over time. I think the issue that we\u2019ve pointed to in the past is that many times, the capital and the OpEx come before the revenues, and that\u2019s kind of what you\u2019re seeing here. And then","Brett Feldman","AT&T.","Dan Schlanger","The AT&T deal, yes, just \u2013 it was signed in time for us to get the impact economically into the first quarter. So the reason it impacted our first quarter is because it had an impact on what our revenues were in the first quarter. So there\u2019s no specifics around that other than it impacted our first quarter.","Brett Feldman","Okay, got it. And if you don\u2019t mind, one last question, just a housekeeping one. Since we have news again on T-Mobile and Sprint, do you have any updated disclosure on your exposure? I know you\u2019ve given that a little over a year ago. Thanks for taking my questions.","Dan Schlanger","I think you can see in the supplement that T-Mobile is around 19% and Sprint around 14% of our total revenues at this point. The disclosure we gave last time was around how much \u2013 when they were both on one tower, overlapping towers, that number is around 5% of our revenues, taking into account the churn that we already assumed in our forecast and talked about from acquired networks.","Brett Feldman","And do you know their weighted average remaining lease term on that 5%?","Dan Schlanger","Yes. They\u2019re five years to seven years.","Brett Feldman","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it.","Dan Schlanger","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. On the commentary about the accelerating leasing, I think given what you said about FirstNet and so forth, is it fair to think that during the course of 2018, we\u2019ll see an acceleration in your leasing activity and then that would set up for 2019 to be better than 2018? And maybe related to that, are we now at the point where all four, all big four of the wireless carriers are now spending at a fairly steady clip? Or is there still some more to come from getting everybody onboard? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Thanks, Simon. To your first question, I\u2019d point out two things. First of all, as we look at calendar year 2018 and the guidance that we provided for 2018, it is an acceleration already over the levels that we saw in 2017. And we\u2019re seeing that across all components of the business. On the towers side, the wireless carriers this year are doing much more on macro sites than what they did last year. And then on the fiber side, both from solutions as well as from small cells, we\u2019re seeing an uplift in the amount of incremental revenues that we\u2019re adding across the fiber assets this year as compared to last year.","So all components are already up in the outlook that we\u2019re giving. More certainly, in the comments about the accelerating leasing environment, I certainly intend to capture that movement from 2017 to 2018 in the way that I spoke about it. I think it\u2019s also the case that as we look at what\u2019s happening in the broader environment, both longer-term, as I talked about, from a 5G standpoint. So some of the customer leasing agreements that we signed and the activity that we\u2019re seeing around the business, that portends an increase from where we are.","Now I would caution you in answering that question that oftentimes, in our business, people look for inflection points, and they look for some \u2013 in any given quarter, whether there\u2019s going to be this meaningful step in leasing and activity. And my experience \u2013 I\u2019ve been at Crown since 1999, and I have found those inflection points to be very rare, both for the positive and to the negative. And as I look at the landscape and what we\u2019re seeing, what I see suggests a very long runway of sustained investment and growth in our business. And that\u2019s what gives us confidence around our 7% to 8% growth in the dividends per share over a long period of time because there are a lot of components that look like we\u2019ve got greater visibility and increasing leasing.","So we\u2019re trying to take a balanced view and say, over a long period of time, we feel pretty good about the 7% to 8%. And I think what we\u2019re saying today and reflecting in both the comments and the press release as well as our prepared comments is that I think we\u2019re more confident about what that growth looks like over a longer period of time, and so I think that\u2019s there.","The last thing, in answer to your second question around all four of the carriers, we are seeing activity from all four of the carriers. In any given quarter, it certainly varies in terms of how much we see from any one carrier. But we\u2019re seeing activity across macro sites and small cells from all four of the wireless carriers and believe, based on the recent customer agreements that we\u2019ve signed as well as the activity that we\u2019re seeing from them, that we\u2019re going to go through a period here where we do see activity from all four operators for a sustained period of time.","Simon Flannery","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to David Barden with Bank of America.","David Barden","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first, to you, Dan, with respect to kind of the new agreements that you\u2019ve signed from the \"several of the big customers,\" could you talk about the terms and conditions that go around those? Or is there anything novel about those agreements that would lead one to kind of change a view about what their potential impact on the business could be?","And then second, could you talk a little bit about maybe how the AT&T tower purchase agreement, which gave a free RAD Center to AT&T, on a go-forward basis, is affecting your ability to maybe monetize AT&T\u2019s activity level or how that factored into the agreement that was released last week and just generally kind of characterize how you think that it affects your ability to monetize FirstNet and AT&T? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Sure. On your first question, I don\u2019t believe there is anything novel, really, here. We approached these agreements in the same way that we\u2019ve done them in the past, same core principles in mind. We\u2019re trying to help our customers identify solutions that help them improve their networks and do those both cost-effectively and efficiently in terms of time while not compromising our ability to capture the appropriate economics in the business. I believe in all cases, the transactions that we\u2019ve done over the last year or so, those have enabled us to realize at least as much value as what we otherwise would have if we had just gone kind of a one at a time.","So I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything new or novel associated with the agreements. I think we\u2019re running the same play that we\u2019ve run for 20 years, being thoughtful about the value of the asset and the value that they\u2019re using on those assets and then providing a shared model that drives both our returns and is a cost-effective way for them to deploy network.","On the second question, specifically, that agreement, obviously, was publicly filed when we announced that transaction. We didn\u2019t provide a free RAD Center to AT&T, and so I\u2019m not sure the nature of that question. But what I would say holistically, going back to kind of my first comments, would be that, again, as we thought about it, we thought about valuation, value of the towers and small cells and what that would look like over time and believe we\u2019ve realized at least as much value as we otherwise would have if we had just gone one at a time.","David Barden","And so, Jay, if I could just follow-up on that kind of comprehensive nature or holistic nature of these agreements, so are these agreements less activity-related and more kind of anticipatory, they kind of ratchet up at some known quantity over a course of time and then customers are able to do what they want to do within Banburismus over that period within those time buckets?","Jay Brown","Dave, I don\u2019t think I want to get into the specifics of how we structured them. Again, there was really two driving goals hearing the conversation from the carrier side. They were looking for time and certainty around the cost of deployments and what they saw in front of them. And then we need to realize appropriate economic value for the use of the asset, and we\u2019re open to being flexible about how we accomplish those two goals based on each customer\u2019s needs. And I would expect we\u2019ll continue to do that into the future as we\u2019ve done in the past.","David Barden","Okay, thanks, guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin","Yes. So following up on that last topic, I was a bit surprised that the term didn\u2019t seem to change if you look at the weighted average remaining contract length with the customer for your most recent MOA, AT&T, and wondering what the thought process there was. I would have expected it to kind of extend a bit. And then can you clarify \u2013 you mentioned it\u2019s kind of holistic. Is there a change in the base escalator with that customer or not? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Sure, Jon. On your first question, again, I would go back to kind of the holistic comment. If you look at our tower business and small cell business over a long period of time, there is very, very low churn in that business. And so while someone might look at the contractual terms of those agreements, I would tend to look at the way we\u2019ve looked at the business over a long period of time and believe that, that infrastructure is going to be there long after the current expiry of the current term in which they\u2019re in.","And so at times, the carriers have desired to extend maturities, and other times, they haven\u2019t. And I think the two guiding principles that I mentioned are the way that we would think about the agreement and we\u2019ll be flexible with customers, depending on what their desires are.","Secondly, in terms of the change of escalator, we did not change the base escalator in the agreements that we signed with customers. So as we thought about components of the agreements, we certainly believe that\u2019s a very valuable component of the leasing exchange that\u2019s done for the assets and the underlying value of the assets. And so that did not change as a part of these agreements.","Jonathan Atkin","Thank you. And then turning to the fiber segment. Can you give us a little bit of a flavor or the breakout now that you have Lightower between enterprise and mobile infrastructure within that segment?","Dan Schlanger","Between \u2013 Jon, are you asking between enterprise and small cells? Is that what you\u2019re asking?","Jonathan Atkin","Yes, yes.","Dan Schlanger","Okay, yes. It\u2019s about 75% fiber solutions and 25% small cells within the fiber segment.","Jonathan Atkin","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.","Ric Prentiss","Thanks, good morning, guys.","Jay Brown","Good morning.","Ric Prentiss","Couple of questions. Looking at the change in guidance, it looks like \u2013 I think you mentioned $60 million change in the straight-line adjustment in 2018. It looks like that drops to about a $40 million change year-over-year from prior view in 2019 and about $20 million change view-to-view on 2020. So it looks like kind of $20 million improvement as we look out 2018, 2019, 2020. Can we use that as a ballpark measure maybe of saying if you\u2019re doing $3 billion-plus of tower revenue and maybe the cash benefit might be like 60 bps a year for long foreseeable future based on the long runway you talked about? Just trying to think if that math works back that way.","Jay Brown","Ric, I think there\u2019s a couple of components of this that \u2013 first, I would basically affirm where you\u2019re, I think, directionally trying to take the question around. It certainly gets greater certainty to the \u2013 our expectation of growth over time, and that\u2019s really consistent with the comments that we\u2019re making. I would probably caution anyone from quarter-to-quarter movements of trying to draw too many inferences five or six years from now because there\u2019s obviously a number of components that affect that.","How many small cell nodes we turn on in the quarter, what is the leasing activity in any given quarter can obviously move \u2013 can move those numbers along with these, as we were talking about before, some of the customer agreements that we signed. But I think the directional nature of your question, I would affirm and say, yes, we\u2019ve increased the certainty of growth around our business. And in addition to the kind of the certainty component, I think we\u2019re also seeing activity that would suggest a sustained increased level of activity in the business over the foreseeable future.","Dan Schlanger","And Ric, as Jay pointed out earlier, I think \u2013 sorry to interrupt, but just as Jay pointed out earlier, I think all of this gives us just more confidence in our ability to continue to grow our dividend over time. As we are signing these agreements, we are moving from what is potential new activity to contracted new activity, and that provides a greater level, as you just said, level of certainty around the business that we have.","Ric Prentiss","Okay. And then on the carrier getting kind of speed, right? AT&T wanted to get more speed and certainty. Can you talk to us a little bit about the time frame from lease application to turning into revenue?","Jay Brown","Sure. Generally, on the tower side, it\u2019s six to nine months it takes us from the time we get an application until we have it on air. It will be on the shorter end of that for amendments and longer end if we\u2019re doing a brand-new co-location on an existing tower. In the small cells, we\u2019ve given the average of 18 to 24 months after the booking occurs in some geographies. Depending on how difficult it is to get it up, it would be longer than that. In places where it\u2019s a co-location, in a market that we\u2019ve done a lot of work in, it may be on the shorter side of that. So it\u2019s a mix, but I think somewhere in the 18 to 24 months is the right time line to use for small cells and six to nine months is the best time line to use for towers.","Ric Prentiss","And one quick housekeeping. Do you see \u2013 is there going to be an equity raise at the market in April? And is that in your guidance, not in your guidance? And there\u2019s some confusion out there given the March equity raise.","Dan Schlanger","Yes. So we did the March equity raise. That obviously is in our guidance. We filed an aftermarket program, but that does not speak to whether we will actually use that or not in any given period. It gives us the ability to go out and market equity. What we said after the March deal was it got us down to what was really close to our target leverage rate range. And as we move out through 2018, we\u2019ll continue to add EBITDA and have capital expenditures that are all included in what we have given as outlook. And we think that we are comfortable with where our leverage profile is now.","Ric Prentiss","Okay. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019re expecting an April offering right now, it\u2019s just an aftermarket filed out there, so it\u2019s available for when you want to do it?","Dan Schlanger","That is what that filing does for us, yes.","Ric Prentiss","And so obviously not in guidance then.","Dan Schlanger","Yes. So we have \u2013 just to be clear on what we do with guidance, when we think about the guidance going forward, it has a lot of assumptions about how we finance the business, and we try to be very consistent with that over time. Where we are in guidance now, as we pointed out, is that some of the guidance change that happened was because we did the March equity, and it reduced the interest expense but it increased the share count. So I think where we are with guidance now at $5.50 is inclusive of all the financing activity that we anticipate.","Ric Prentiss","Great. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Jay.","Dan Schlanger","Thanks, Ric.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Niknam","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two on fiber and small cells. One, can you give us any more color on what drove the increase in your small cell pipeline up to 30,000? Particularly, was it one specific customer or more broad-based? And then secondly, on fiber, I think you mentioned maybe considering more organic builds in fiber just given the opportunity. Is this within your existing top 25 markets? Or is this maybe beginning to branch out a little bit more broadly? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Sure. Thanks, Matthew. On the first question, the pipeline was driven by activity across all four of the operators, and we\u2019re \u2013 our intention of giving the number was to be able to give you a sense of \u2013 we\u2019re obviously putting nodes on air, and I think the math would roughly play out where we\u2019ve put about 5,000-ish nodes on air roughly over the last year or so since we talked about the size of the pipeline. And then we\u2019ve added about 10,000 more nodes to the pipeline to be constructed over future dates.","So to give you a sense of kind of the activity relative to the pace at which we\u2019re putting them on air and all four of the operators are driving that increase in pipeline as well as all four of the operators saw the benefit of some of the nodes that were put on during the last 12 months or so. Around how we\u2019re thinking about markets, generally speaking, I would say the majority of both the CapEx and the nodes that we\u2019re receiving are going to be in markets that were already in, in those top 25 markets, although expanding the footprint of those markets.","What we have seen happen, and this continues, we\u2019ve seen this happen the last six or seven years, when we first started investing in small cells, is there tends to be an initial investment in the most dense components of a given market. And then as investment happens over time, that investment spreads from city centers, maybe potentially central business districts, out into \u2013 further into the community and further away from those central business districts. We\u2019ve seen that pattern continue as the business has grown.","So for the most part, the capital that we see in front of us in the medium term, the short term, that\u2019s going to be largely in the markets that we\u2019re already in. I do believe, based on the activity and growth in data, there\u2019s going to be a need for small cells beyond the top 25 markets, and we would expect to see, over time, the carriers expand their desire and need to deploy small cells beyond the top 25 markets. But the capital decisions that we\u2019ve made today and the vast majority of the operating activity that you\u2019re seeing us perform, that\u2019s primarily in the top 25 markets.","And specifically to your comment around why are we making the comment around organic build, we\u2019re expanding the footprint that we either acquired or have built today in order to cover needs in those \u2013 largely in those top 25 markets.","Matthew Niknam","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.","Nick Del Deo","Hi, thanks for taking my question. First, have you seen any increased propensity for multiband antennas in the applications you received or the discussions you\u2019re having with the carriers relative to the past? I\u2019ve heard mixed messages on this front. I would love to hear your thoughts.","Jay Brown","Nick, I would tell you, over the long term, the reason why you\u2019ve heard mixed messages is because there\u2019s mixed approaches. The carriers have different approaches, and they take different approaches by market. Ultimately, they\u2019re trying to cost-effectively deploy the network in ways that make their network most efficient. And so depending on their spectrum position in the market, the amount of demand on those networks, they will make differing decisions. So the fact that you\u2019re hearing mixed answers is a pretty accurate way of describing the way it is ultimately deployed.","Nick Del Deo","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then maybe one on the small cell front. We\u2019ve also heard that some municipalities gotten incrementally more difficult to deal with when it comes to permitting. May be as builds get more towards residential areas. Have you seen the same thing? And if you have, has it affected the timeline you\u2019ve laid out for when the chunks of your pipeline will turn out and start generating revenue?","Jay Brown","I mean, municipalities are obviously a component of what that time line when we talked about 18 to 24 months to deploy small cells. And similar to \u2013 if we were having this conversation 20 years ago, I think people would have asked a similar question about the deployment of towers. It is certainly a barrier to entry, and it\u2019s certainly something we have to navigate in the process of building the infrastructure. I don\u2019t know that I would necessarily describe the municipalities as becoming more difficult. What I would describe is the scale at which we\u2019re doing this over as many markets as we\u2019re deploying this infrastructure means there\u2019s more conversation in social media and in the press about the activities happening.","We\u2019re pretty committed to working with municipalities because we want to be a long-term player in the market. And so following whatever rules, zoning and planning rules that they have in place is something we\u2019re committed to doing. We\u2019re going to do it the right way and be a good partner over a long period of time. And I have not found the difficulties, as you described them, with municipalities to be something that, in any way, inhibits our returns or our ability to deploy the infrastructure.","It\u2019s a matter of going through the process and ensuring we\u2019re following the right rules and regulations of particular municipalities and working with them constructively to provide for some of the aesthetics that they desire and, at the same time, getting the infrastructure that\u2019s really needed to get that deployed on a timely basis.","Nick Del Deo","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Michael Rollins with Citi.","Michael Rollins","Hi, thanks for taking the question. If you look at the change in straight-line for 2018 of about $60 million and if you look at what that might represent in terms of total contract value, how should investors view that in terms of future activity because you have holistic in the late situation? It seems to represent the totality of activity that was expected from the carrier, whatever the upgrade or incremental deployment purpose was. So in this situation with these new agreements that you have, could investors look at what\u2019s represented by the straight-line as the totality of the expectation over the next number of years? Or you look at it more as a minimum? And maybe you can put that incremental opportunity into context.","Jay Brown","Mike, you were breaking out in some components of the question, but I think I got the basic gist of it. The short answer is that\u2019s a baseline of the level of activity. Obviously, what we straight-line would be the committed component or some portion of the committed component of the activity. And there is upside from there, and that would be true across all of the customer agreements that we\u2019ve signed.","Dan Schlanger","And Mike, I think as Jay pointed out earlier, it\u2019s hard to take exactly from straight-line and try to make that into just exactly what the activity is. Although it could be higher than that, and this is kind of the low end or the baseline of it. What we\u2019re looking at, as we\u2019ve been talking about, is the fact that this is pushing in a lot of the activity that we had been counting on into a contracted element. And something that we\u2019re really excited about is the fact that we now see lots of clarity and understand where we\u2019re going to go over the next several years with one of our largest customers. And we\u2019ve solved some of their issues and we\u2019ve gotten some economics from it, and we feel really good about where we are. It\u2019s just hard to see exactly in the straight-line number and try to predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen with the activity. What we believe it is a signal of, though, is, as we\u2019ve been talking about, increasing levels of activity across a multiyear period that we have more visibility into at this point.","Michael Rollins","And is there a way to think about how much of that was driven by towers versus how much of that was driven by fiber?","Jay Brown","Yes. Well, you can look in the first quarter and see where the change in straight-line happened, and the vast majority of that was on the tower side.","Michael Rollins","Thanks very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk","Great, thanks. Last year, in 2017, your amortization of prepaid was $244 million, and the year before that, it was $203 million, so the change was about $40 million. I think in the past, you said you expect a similar change in 2018 versus 2017. So if you look at that $79 million in the first quarter, and you just basically said there was no change in that whatsoever, that implies more of a $70 million increase. So is that amortization of prepaid going to decline over the course of the year in order to get down to that $40 million? Or is a higher amortization of prepaid expected?","Dan Schlanger","Yes. Thanks, Walt. It\u2019s not going to decline over the year. It is going to be higher. But about half of that, about $40 million of it, is related to the purchase accounting around Lightower, and so it\u2019s included in our acquisition bucket, not in our new leasing bucket.","Walter Piecyk","Got it. So of the $79 million for the first quarter, you\u2019re saying there was $10 million there that was \u2013 that should be in the acquisition bucket? Or the $79 million is fully all prepaid?","Dan Schlanger","There\u2019s $10 million of it that would be in the acquisition bucket because it\u2019s related to the acquisition of Lightower. So the previous statement we made is that there was about the same year-over-year in our new leasing, and that is still the statement, is that the amount of prepaid in our new leasing is consistent from a dollar basis year-on-year.","Walter Piecyk","Okay. So if that\u2019s $40 million and then there\u2019s an extra $10 million, then that means the $79 million shouldn\u2019t change throughout the course of the year. Should it stay at $79 million, around $80 million for every quarter this year?","Dan Schlanger","Yes, it\u2019s going to be around that, yes.","Walter Piecyk","Okay. And just on prepaid in general, to the extent that \u2013 there\u2019s a time, basically, it\u2019s reimbursed CapEx to a certain extent, like when you collect the revenue, you\u2019re collecting more revenue than the CapEx associated with it? Or is it \u2013 are those equal dollars? Like how does that revenue fall through as far as the stuff is going to the deferred revenue bucket and then booked back onto the income statement?","Dan Schlanger","Yes, it\u2019s the same number as what we book in prepaid. We ultimately get in \u2013 what we book in upfront prepaid is what we ultimately get in prepaid rent amortization. Look, and just to be clear, though, it\u2019s not cash at that point because the cash is coming upfront. So we get the cash upfront as a reimbursement of CapEx, and then we amortize that over the course of the life of the contract.","Walter Piecyk","Right. So let\u2019s assume that your CapEx is $10 million, and you collect $12 million, right, because you\u2019re getting some return on that first tenant, right, that first build. Is it just the $10 million or $12 million that\u2019s going through the amortization of prepaid rent?","Dan Schlanger","So I\u2019m going to try to change your example a little bit. It\u2019s not that we collect more CapEx than what we spend in order to get a return. It\u2019s that, in order to get our return, we get revenues and we get reimbursed a portion of our CapEx. So if we spend $10 million on anything, we would get some portion of the $10 million reimbursed to us, and then we would make our return over time by making revenues from that customer. So let\u2019s say of the $10 million, we get $2 million reimbursed. That $2 million is then amortized over the life of the contract.","Walter Piecyk","Got it. So any of those \u2013 any of that revenue that\u2019s effectively in the $220 million guidance for the year, there\u2019s a CapEx associated with it that completely offsets that revenue. I\u2019m talking about the revenue in amortization of prepaid. Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Amy Yong with Macquarie.","Amy Yong","Thanks and good morning. Just question on your fiber needs. When we think about a 30,000 nodes, how much fiber is required to support this? I guess, we\u2019re just trying to size up how much driver requirements you need over the next 18 to 24 months. Thank you.","Jay Brown","Amy, our historical average has been we\u2019ve been adding about 2.5 nodes per mile of fiber. Among those 30,000 nodes, there\u2019s a component of those nodes that are \u2013 as I mentioned in my comments, about half of the nodes that we added to the pipeline in the first quarter were going on existing fiber, so we would expect very little to no additional fiber needed there. And then for the other half, that\u2019s an expansion of the fiber footprint. And to extend that out to the whole pipeline of 30,000, we have a mix in there of new markets that we\u2019re building, as I was speaking to earlier, as well as co-location. So we will \u2013 the fiber need is dependent upon whether we\u2019re expanding in new market or co-locating on existing.","Amy Yong","Got it. And then, I guess, the guidance for 1Q OpEx, is that the right base to use going forward? And at what point should we actually expect that number to drop down?","Dan Schlanger","Yes, Amy. The guidance we\u2019ve given \u2013 you can look at the full year guidance, and that would give you a good base for what to use going forward. I think your question around when it would drop down or at least to see the leverage, look, what we\u2019re looking at is, as Jay pointed out, a potentially highly increasing level of activity to the extent that 5G comes in. And what we\u2019re trying to do is position ourselves to have the right assets and the right capabilities to take on that demand and, ultimately, that market opportunity. And what we\u2019re excited about is that we have so much of that coming our way, and we\u2019ve positioned ourselves uniquely to have the right assets to ultimately take advantage of that opportunity.","And as that continues, if we continue to add small cells at a pace that\u2019s greater than what we\u2019ve added to them in the past, we might have to add expenses, and we\u2019ll certainly have to continue to add capital. But those will all be investments that will be included in what we look at in terms of the returns we get. And what we\u2019re seeing is those returns are much in excess of our cost of capital over time. And with the potential increase in 5G, it would be even more upside for us. So what we\u2019re excited about is exactly that, is that we\u2019re in a good position to take advantage of that upside, and that may require \u2013 or will require additional capital and may require additional expenses.","But at some point, we do think that, that will turn, and we\u2019ll have most of the capital in place, most of the fiber in place and will come down on that expense \u2013 those expense levels and the incremental capital needed. But that may be years from now, depending on when this opportunity plays out, and we, frankly, hope that it is years from now because that will just mean we get to take advantage of more and more of the opportunities that are set in front of us.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Gutman","Hi, thanks for taking the question. On the small cell deployment, you said 18 to 24 months. You\u2019ve also said in the past, I think, a two-year cycle on new builds, on new fiber builds. I was wondering \u2013 I assume there\u2019s a difference in deployment timing on existing \u2013 when you have existing fiber versus a new build. And if it\u2019s still 18 months at the low end on existing fiber, what are some of the other factors that stretch out that long besides the permitting issues?","Jay Brown","Robert, the 18 to 24 months, we give that as a number, roughly the two-year number, as an indication of how long it takes us on average across all of the activity that we\u2019re seeing. As I mentioned earlier, if it\u2019s a co-location on existing fiber, it\u2019s probably inside of that time line. And if it\u2019s brand-new constructed fiber, it very well may be outside of that time line. So we\u2019re just trying to give you a sense of average, when we give you a new pipeline number and activity, how far we are away from actually receiving revenue and cash flow associated with that.","That\u2019s the purpose of doing that. I would tell you the biggest driver of that time line, though, would be things related to the zoning and planning process and the difficulty of going through the real estate process of that. So if we think about the actual \u2013 how long does it actually take us to construct the node once all the permits are in place, that\u2019s a relatively short component of that overall time line. We spend most of the time \u2013 most of that period of time really working on what you would think of as the soft costs associated with that of gaining the permits and construction rights to deploy the infrastructure.","Robert Gutman","Great, thanks. And did you say what the total on air and the total backlog is now given the changes at this point?","Jay Brown","We\u2019re about 60,000 total on air or in the pipeline, so we\u2019re about 30,000 that have been put on air and about 30,000 in the pipeline.","Dan Schlanger","Yes. And Robert, as Jay mentioned in the past, the last time we gave that number was around 25,000 and 25,000. So we put 5,000 additional on air and booked an additional 10,000 in order to get to those two numbers.","Robert Gutman","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.","Spencer Kurn","Hi guys. I\u2019ve got one question just on guidance and then one more strategic question. So on guidance, it looks like you came in $2 million ahead on cash site leasing rental revenue this quarter, but you actually lowered guidance for this metric for the full year. Usually, at the start of the year, I\u2019d expect an organic beat to be annualized for the full year guidance. So I\u2019m just wondering, what were the sort of offsetting impacts to the beat this quarter that caused you to lower the full year guidance?","Dan Schlanger","Yes, Spencer. I\u2019ll just say that those are all within the ranges that we gave, and getting into the $2 million to $3 million specificity is not something we\u2019re going to do on a quarter-to-quarter basis within our guidance. So we\u2019re just trying to keep it within the ranges, and everything you\u2019re talking about is in that range because otherwise, then we would just give the midpoint as the only point. So it\u2019s just in the range is what I would say.","Spencer Kurn","Got it. Thanks. And then more strategically, you\u2019re obviously the most uniquely positioned tower company because you have a more hybrid approach between towers and small cells. Could you just talk about the benefits of this approach? And how do you weigh capturing incremental revenue growth on towers versus fiber? I\u2019m really curious how you think about an incremental \u2013 the value of the incremental dollar of revenue on towers versus fiber. Thanks.","Jay Brown","Yes. I appreciate the question, Spencer, because this is sort of part and parcel of the way we think about capital allocation. The reason why we\u2019ve invested in fiber is because we think it enhances long- term dividends per share. And that\u2019s the measure upon which we make all of our discretionary capital investments, whether it\u2019s in towers or on the fiber side. And so the benefit to it over the long term is we think we\u2019ll provide shareholders with greater returns, particularly in the form of the amount of dividends we pay per share over the long term. I think we sit in a unique position, having watched the deployment of macro towers 20 years ago and then the need as it grew over time, the density of the network grew and the co-location activities and seeing the returns of those.","What we\u2019re seeing in the fiber movie is basically a sequel of what happened in towers. In the early days, you have a carrier who needs to cover a given geography, and over a relatively short period of time, other carriers need to cover that same geography. So we\u2019re in the process of working with carriers and understanding their deployment plans and then assessing whether or not we believe the areas that they want to deploy small cells in have the opportunity for co-location. And as we spoke about in two specific markets, in the case of Phoenix and Philadelphia, I think we\u2019ve done a really good job of identifying locations to deploy small cells for an initial tenant, and then we\u2019ve seen co-location that\u2019s come after that, and that\u2019s driven very attractive returns.","And you can see that in the micro standpoint of looking at individual markets, and we believe you can see that overall in the totality of the fiber business. Although granted, in the totality of the fiber business, it\u2019s a little harder to see the incremental benefit from it because we\u2019re continuing to invest heavily and expand into markets where we believe there will be future opportunities. So we\u2019re building very immature assets that, at the moment, that we believe have a significant amount of upside and future growth that will enable us, we believe, to continue our stated goal of 7% to 8% growth over a long period of time. And we\u2019re able to do it with customers that we know really well in the U.S. and in the top \u2013 generally in the top 25 markets. So that\u2019s the approach, but it\u2019s based on thinking about what we think the incremental increase in dividends per share are going to be. That\u2019s how we\u2019re driving our capital allocation decisions.","To the second part of your question around how we evaluate small cells and tower tenants, we want both of those is the short answer to that. And we\u2019re trying to figure out a way to grow as much revenue on towers as we can, and we\u2019re trying to grow as much revenue on small cells as we possibly can. Those businesses, obviously, have similar customers in many respects, but from an economic standpoint, they work very differently. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, small cell systems are not homogenous. So depending on the geography that we\u2019re working on and the underlying cost, then we need to appropriately adjust the pricing mechanisms in markets based on the underlying cost of deployments, and we do that. On the tower side, the revenue and rents tend to be more homogenous across markets and across assets.","Spencer Kurn","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Tim Horan","Could you give a little bit more color on the fiber business maybe in totality, what the organic growth is, churn, maybe pricing? Have you seen any effects in the total business from the tax restructuring here in the U.S.? And then specifically on that business also, when you have a second tenant coming on for small cells in a specific site, some of your competitors discount the second tenant pricing. Have you guys \u2013 do you guys do that? Or do you try to hold the pricing similar to what you charge your first tenant?","Jay Brown","Yes. Generally, in the fiber business, I would go back to where we\u2019ve talked about investment. Where we\u2019ll deploy capital, we get an initial yield on that capital somewhere in the neighborhood of about 6% to 7%. When we add a second tenant, our returns go into the double digits, low-teens area as \u2013 from a yield standpoint, and that would be a recurring cash yield against net invested capital. And then if we get beyond that second tenant, obviously, north of that into the high teens in terms of yields on the assets. From a totality of the business, we\u2019re seeing two things. We\u2019re seeing the opportunity to continue to invest around that 6% to 7% area to expand in further markets. And then for the assets that have been online for a longer period of time, we\u2019re seeing those incremental yields at the levels that I just mentioned.","And the second question around second tenant pricing, again, back to the answer on the first question. We haven\u2019t seen any change in pricing as we add additional tenants. There\u2019s great value in the shared infrastructure model. Whether we\u2019re talking about towers or talking about fiber and allowing a carrier to utilize that asset and share it across multiple carriers, that lowers their overall cost of deployment. And it\u2019s why the tower model has been so successful over time, and it\u2019s why, I believe, we\u2019ve seen such great success on the fiber side. It\u2019s a cost-effective way for them to deploy small cells, and we don\u2019t need to discount the pricing for the second one. The value of the shared economics is already in play.","Dan Schlanger","And Tim, just to \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Go ahead.","Tim Horan","So did you give the organic \u2013 for the fiber business in total, the organic growth rate, did you guys give that by any chance?","Dan Schlanger","Yes. So that was where I was going to go with it. I think Jay was talking about more on the small cell side. So just to try to break out the businesses overall, towers, we\u2019ve said that the new leasing activity is around $110 million this year; escalators, around the neighborhood of 3%; and churn is in the neighborhood of 1% to 2%. On small cells, we\u2019re seeing about $55 million of new leasing for this year. Escalators are about half of what we see in towers, about 1.5% on average. The churn is in that 1% to 2% range, very low. And then on fiber solutions, specifically, we\u2019re at $45 million of new leasing activity across our business, and the escalators are zero, and churn is in the mid- to high single digits per year range, so 7%, 8%, 9% per year.","We think that those are all very attractive businesses. And as Jay was pointing out before, with small cells getting those returns that Jay was talking about, which were double what we saw in the same maturity cycle of towers, the ability to add something like the fiber solutions revenue to it that generates returns in and of itself is really an attractive place for us to be. It allows us to expand that shared infrastructure model to lower the cost to any one user by sharing it across multiple users. And the reason we\u2019re able to get the same pricing on the second tenant as we are in the first in a small cell system is basically, we\u2019re subsidizing that first tenant with the expectation a second, third and fourth tenant may come. So they\u2019re getting a lower price than they could get if they were doing it themselves or using somebody else, and we\u2019re passing that along by deferring that cost over more customers than just that first tenant.","Tim Horan","And then last, last. On the total CapEx, is this a good run rate? Or should it kind of pick up from here because of fiber demand?","Dan Schlanger","It\u2019s generally a good run rate. We\u2019re seeing incremental fiber demand as we talk, but it\u2019s not a significant number in the capital that would change where we are overall.","Tim Horan","Thanks guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Phil Cusick","Hey guys, thanks. So can you help us think about the growth of small cells? And as we talk to investors, it seems like people sort of struggle with the high capital intensity here versus the percent growth that we\u2019re seeing off of small cell. And Jay, you mentioned, and I think it\u2019s a good point, that it\u2019s rare to see inflections in this business. Should we be thinking about an acceleration in the small cell organic revenue growth over time as this big backlog matures? Or should we just think about it as sort of steady growth on either percentage or revenue basis as the business grows?","Jay Brown","Phil, I think there\u2019s two things that are happening. Let\u2019s assume that capital investment and activity stays relatively stable across the whole business. What I would tell you is that the long runway of growth, we\u2019re, as we talked about, kind of a leasing activity, we\u2019re seeing a lease-up that you make an apples-to-apples comparison of adding the second tenant over a five-year period of time. So people who have gotten comfortable with the way towers lease up were going at about twice that pace, so the incremental change, when you look at it in any given market or any given asset, is that the yield, the margins and revenue are growing at a faster pace, roughly double the pace of what we saw on towers. Now that\u2019s masked by the fact that the capital intensity that you can see on the financial statements and the continued investment that we\u2019re making around CapEx is related to the fact that we\u2019re having experiences like Phoenix and Philadelphia, where the early capital that we put in has resulted in exactly the returns that we anticipated, where we\u2019re into the low teens as we add a second tenant, which has encouraged us to continue to make investments. And those investments go into the mix at about 6% to 7% and require sort of that high intensity of capital.","Now if we roll the play all the way forward and roll this out over a five- or a 10-year period of time, I believe, just like we\u2019ve seen in towers, we\u2019ll see activity over a long period of time where the carriers come back and increase the density of nodes that they have across the fiber. We\u2019ll see amendments to those nodes and that fiber as they add additional technologies over time. And we\u2019ll see carriers who are not initially on that fiber come to that fiber and need it as they build out the density of that fiber. So over a long period of time, we will get back to a place where there\u2019s sort of a stable level of revenue. But in a period of time like we\u2019re in now, where we\u2019re continuing to expand the pie, the dollars of revenue that are going in are going to be increasing as a greater number of assets come online as we build out the fiber that we\u2019ve contracted to build.","Phil Cusick","So if I can sum up a little bit, maybe we should be looking at dollars of investment increasing. And then over time, as you have more and more of your new sites \u2013 new small cells go on existing infrastructure, that dollars of revenue and percent intensity should start to normalize?","Jay Brown","Yes. I would \u2013 again, it depends on how much we end up investing, how long do we get to before we have sort of a stable asset base, where then you look at it more on the way we would look at towers now and you compare year-over-year on a just pure dollars basis and say, did that activity increase or decrease? It may take some period of time, depending on what the opportunity is ahead before we get to that place where we have a stable base of assets, upon which we\u2019re making that comparison.","Phil Cusick","Great, understood. And second question. As FirstNet gear goes on to towers, there\u2019s a risk that sites have to be hardened. Can you talk about your obligations to harden your towers, if any are declared critical infrastructure? What\u2019s on you versus the carrier?","Jay Brown","Phil, I think that gets to the specifics of how we contract with customers, so I\u2019m going to beg off of that question.","Phil Cusick","It just seems \u2013 I know maybe it\u2019s a little cute, but it seems like sort of a change in strategy if you are obligated. With the rest of the business, it\u2019s pretty much on the carrier if they need something in the site to be changed for a contract, existing or new. Is there a shift in that strategy and what you\u2019re willing to be obligated for?","Jay Brown","Phil, I think I\u2019d go back to the comments that I made earlier in the call about we approached the agreement with the same core principles and thoughts around the economic trade. So if the implication of your question is a loss in value to us, that wouldn\u2019t meet that core principle that I spoke about earlier.","Phil Cusick","Okay. Thanks, Jay.","Operator","And we have time for one last question. We\u2019ll go to Brandon Lee Nispel KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Brandon Lee Nispel","I was wondering if you could give us the contribution for Lightower in the quarter. And then what type of small cell leasing activity are you seeing on Lightower versus some of your assets that you\u2019ve acquired before? And then just last question on Lightower and then I have one more follow-up is, are you changing anything in you\u2019re doing in terms of integration? Are you seeing any synergies for that asset? And then one more question just on the guidance. I\u2019m curious, how did you get a lease done with AT&T that doesn\u2019t include some sort of portion of new leasing activity from FirstNet when AT&T says they want to move fast in deploying that network?","Jay Brown","On your first question, around Lightower, it\u2019s progressing as we expected. We had previously given the outlook for what we thought they would do this year, and I would say we\u2019re on track for our expectations. So no update to the guidance that we\u2019ve previously given there, and the business performed in the range that we had expected in the first quarter. On the second question around integration, we haven\u2019t changed any of our approaches around integration, so we\u2019re continuing to run the play as we\u2019ve run it in the past and welcoming some 900 employees from Lightower into the business, thrilled to have them. And they\u2019ve done a terrific job helping us run the integration into the business.","As I mentioned before, we think kind of late \u2013 really late this year or probably early part of next year, we\u2019ll have those activities around integration complete. And then we\u2019ll be able to turn our sights towards how do we continue to grow beyond maybe just the markets that we\u2019re in, the opportunity to add additional revenues to the fiber plants that we own. On the last question, we tried to be specific that we had provided for AT&T the ability to deploy FirstNet. I know that\u2019s been a really common question over the last couple of years for us. So they do have the right as a result of this recent agreement to deploy FirstNet, and we would expect to see the impact \u2013 although not material to our 2018 results, we would expect to see the benefit of that activity in periods beyond 2018.","And with that, operator, I appreciate everyone joining the call this morning. Thanks for the time. We\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re seeing in the business and look forward to giving you update next quarter.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ben Lowe. Sir, you may begin.","Ben Lowe","Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today as we review our third quarter 2018 results. On the call morning are Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.","Today the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors section of the Company's SEC filings.","Our statements are made as of today, October 18, 2018, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. In addition, today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the Supplemental Information Package in the Investors section of the Company's website at crowncastle.com.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Jay.","Jay Brown","Thanks, Ben, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. Over the last two decades, we have established an unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers and 65,000 route miles of high capacity fiber in the top U.S. markets where we see the greatest long-term growth.","We continue to believe the U.S. represents the best market in the world to earn shared communication infrastructure, and we believe our ability to offer a combination of towers, small cells, and fiber solutions to our customers provides a valuable differentiation in the market.","On this call, I wanted to highlight two important things. First, our strategy to invest in towers and small cells and fiber has positioned us to capture accelerating leasing activity which is driving dividend growth. And secondly, we continue to see tremendous opportunities to invest in new assets that we believe will generate future growth.","On the first point, executing on our strategy is leading to consistent dividend growth. As we increased our annualized common stock dividend by 7% to $4.50 per share, in line with what we believe our AFFO per share growth will be in 2019.","The growth in 2019 is based in part on our pipeline of contract with new business which has increased in each quarter this year and is driving the accelerating new leasing growth we expect to see in 2019. As shown in our outlook, we expect the positive trends to continue as we expect towers to contribute approximately $125 million to new leasing growth in 2019, which is up nearly 15% from the $110 million we expect to see in 2018.","Likewise, we expect small cells to generate new leasing activity of approximately $75 million in 2019, which is more than 35% higher than the $55 million we expect in 2018. In addition to the expected acceleration and new leasing activity, our pipeline of contracted small cell nodes to be constructed over the next 18 to 24 months continues to grow, and currently stands at an all-time high of approximately 35,000, which is up 40% from this time last year.","This increased activity is a result of all four of our large customers investing in their networks through towers and small cells to both keep pace with the current 4G demand environment and position their networks for 5G. Carriers in the U.S. are expected to lead the way and be among the first operators in the world to deploy commercial 5G services with all for the national carriers working to rollout 5G services currently.","Underscoring how attractive the U.S. market is for communications infrastructure ownership, Ericsson estimates that 5G will account for nearly 50% of mobile subscriptions in North America by 2023, compared to just 20% globally. According to industry estimates, mobile data traffic in North America will increased by 40% per year between now and 2023, resulting in a staggering eight fold increase in the volume of data writing across mobile network.","This growth and data will require substantial densification of wireless networks. And we believe Crown Castle is in a great position at the center of these megatrends as our portfolio of well located towers and dense high capacity metro fiber assets remain the most cost effective option for our customers deployment needs.","In the near-term since 2014 and inclusive of the dividend increased we announced yesterday, we have grown our dividend by a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 8%, fueled by these underlying industries trends and the resulting revenue growth.","Turning to the second thing, we\u2019re excited about the significant investments we are making to build new assets that we expect will drive long-term growth in cash flows and dividend per share. We believe we are in the very early innings of a huge opportunity with high capacity dense metro fiber, which has become critical for wireless and wired networks.","Over the last several years, we have built and acquired an unmatched portfolio of more than 65,000 route mile of high capacity fiber in the top market where we see the greatest long-term demand from multiple customers. Consistent with our expectations, we continue to see very attractive initial returns on our fiber investments with initial yields of 6% to 7% for the first tenants.","Over the long-term and similar to towers, we expect the returns on these investments to increase as we add more customers to our fiber assets, which will drive future dividend growth. We are using the same playbook we used with towers by sharing the asset across multiple tenants to generate attractive returns and it\u2019s playing out better than we expected.","Looking back five years ago, we had an aspirational goal to be able to deploy about $10,000 nodes per year. At the time, we were adding 1,000 nodes per year, so this was seen as a significant increase and capability. Looking ahead to 2019, we expect to deploy between 10,000 and 15,000 nodes exceeding our aspirational goal. Our team has done a terrific job building capability and expertise that can deliver for our customers at significant scale.","Further proving out the model, we are seeing demand from multiple tenants on the same fiber asset with a meaningful portion of the nodes we expect to deploy in 2019 collocating on existing small cell networks. By collocating additional tenants on existing fiber networks we are able to generate high incremental margins that we expect will grow the yield into the mid to high-teens over time.","With our leading capabilities in fiber solutions, we have the ability to increase the yield on our fiber investment by growing cash flows from both small cells and fiber solutions customers that need access to the same high capacity in dense metro fiber assets, while the current utilization of our fiber portfolio is similar to that of a single tenant tower our current 8% yield is more than double what we saw when our towers had only one tenant.","All of this increases our conviction to continue investing in new fiber assets that we believe will expand our long-term opportunity. So in closing, our strategy to invest in towers, small cells and fiber has positioned us to capture this accelerating leasing activity which is in turn driving dividend growth. And we continue to see tremendous opportunities to invest in new assets that will further this strategy over the long-term.","With our unmatched portfolio of assets and operating capability, I believe Crown Castle is best positioned to capture these immense long-term opportunities while consistently returning capital to shareholders through a high quality dividend that we expect to grow 7% to 8% annually.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schlanger","Thanks, Jay. Good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned we had another great quarter results in the third quarter. That sets us up to finish 2018 on a strong note and provides a solid foundation for 2019.","As you can see in the initial 2019 outlook we provided, we expect to grow AFFO per share by 7% which led us to increase our dividend by the same amount. The third quarter results in 2019 outlook reflect the strength of our business model and our ability to leverage our leadership position in the U.S. across towers, small cells, and fiber solutions to generate continued growth.","Starting with Slide 4 the presentation on our website, in the third quarter, we exceeded the high end of guidance for site rental revenues and AFFO while adjusted EBITDA exceeded the midpoint of the range.","When compared to our prior third quarter outlook, site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA benefited from approximately $3 million of additional straight lines revenues which were primarily a result of term expenses associated with leasing activity as well as some additional contribution from our Lightower acquisition. These benefits were partially offset by approximately $2 million of higher straight line expenses.","Further, while AFFO did not benefit from the straight line revenues, it did benefit from approximately $3 million of lower sustaining capital expenditures which are now expected to occur during the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the impact of these items, third quarter site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO each exceeded the midpoint of our prior outlook.","Beginning in 2019 and consistent with our intention to align our public communications with the long-term approach we take internally in managing the business, we will no longer provide guidance for quarterly results.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter at a 5.1 times debt-to-EBITDA ratio and intend to finance the business with five terms of leverage longer term as we remain committed maintaining our investment grade credit profile.","To that point, we were excited that earlier this week Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating to BBB flat, which we believe is a reflection of the stability and attractiveness of our business model. With the increasing interest rates we have seen over the recent past, we are pleased with the structure of our balance sheet with a weighted average duration of our debt of greater than six years and only 20% floating rate debt.","Now moving to Slide 5. At the midpoints, we increased our full year 2018 outlook for site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA, while leaving the outlook for AFFO unchanged. The increase to site rental revenues reflects the outperformance from the third quarter that resulted from a combination of better than expected performance from our Lightower acquisition and the additional straight line revenues I mentioned earlier. Meanwhile, the increase to adjusted EBITDA reflects the higher than expected site rental revenue offset by some additional expenses, while AFFO remains unchanged as the higher straight line revenue does not contribute to AFFO.","Staying on Slide 5, our full year 2019 outlook highlights include 7% expected growth in AFFO per share from $5.49 in 2018 to $5.85 in 2019 at the midpoint of outlook and a 7% increase to our annualized dividends per share from $4.20 to $4.50. This dividend increase is supported by the expected acceleration and leasing activity in 2019 and demonstrates our ability to deliver on our growth targets while investing in new assets that will drive future growth. Over the long-term, we expect the returns on our small cell and fiber investments will increase as we lease the assets to additional customers, which we would expect will significantly add a future dividend per share.","Moving now to Slide 6. At the mid points, we expect approximately $220 million of growth in site rental revenues from 2018 to 2019 consisting of $280 million of organic contribution to site rental revenues offset by change in straight line revenues of approximately $60 million. Organic growth in 2019, distributed by new leasing activity of $365 million at the midpoint, up from $205 million at the midpoint point in 2018 representing an acceleration in activity levels.","As Jay mentioned earlier, at the midpoints of outlook, new leasing activity in 2019 is expected to be a $125 million for towers, up from a $110 million in 2018, $75 million for small cells, up from $55 million in 2018 and $165 million for fiber solutions up from $45 million in 2018. In addition to new leasing activity, we expect annual contracted tenant escalations to contribute approximately $90 million in growth at the midpoint in 2019.","Growth from new leasing activity in tenant escalations is offset by approximately $175 million of expected non-renewals, resulting in organic growth of $280 million at the midpoint. Expected non-renewals in 2019 consist of non-renewals on our tower business at the high end of our historical 1% to 2% range, over half of which is related to wireless carrier consolidations occurred earlier this decade, and also includes less than 1% non-renewals on our small cell business and high single digit non-renewals on our fiber solutions business.","The approximately $280 million organic contribution to site rental revenues represents approximately 6% growth year-over-year that consists of approximately 5% growth from towers, approximately 20% growth from small cells, and approximately 5% growth from fiber solutions.","Turning to Slide 7, I'd like to walk through the expected AFFO growth from 2018 to 2019 of approximately $160 million at the midpoint of outlook. Starting on the left organic contribution to site rental revenue growth of $280 million at the midpoint is partially offset by an approximately $80 million increase in cash expenses. This increase in expenses is a combination of the typical cost escalations in our business and the direct expenses associated with accelerating new leasing activity.","Moving to the right, we expect the contributions from network services to increase by approximately $25 million from 2018 levels consistent with the higher expected leasing activity in the towers business.","And finally, we expect AFFO to be negatively affected by approximately $70 million of other items, in this case, increased financing costs. The approximately $70 million increase in financing costs from 2018 to 2019 is inclusive of approximately $25 million related to higher expected average floating interest rates in 2019 when compared to average interest rates in 2018, as well as $45 million related to the funding of our discretionary capital expenditures.","Similar to 2018, we expect our overall capital expenditures in 2019 to be around $2 billion or around $1.5 billion net of capital contributions from our customers. Summarizing our results, we expect to deliver 7% growth in AFFO per share in 2019 driven by accelerating leasing activity offset by the higher financing costs I just mentioned.","In closing, our unmatched portfolio of shared communications infrastructure assets uniquely positions us to return capital to our shareholders in the form of a high quality dividend and to meet our goal of growing that dividend by 7% to 8% annually, while allowing us to make investments in new assets we believe will extend our long-term growth opportunity.","With that, Jonathan, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery","Just on the quarterly guidance. Can you give us any color about the 2019? Is there any pacing first half versus second half or anything that's unusual through the year? And then, you were talking about the long term drivers, the FCC has been moving to get a lot of spectrum out in the marketplace. Can you just give us a little bit of color on the CBRS and the C-band? Do you think that's more for the small cell portfolio or for the macro tower portfolio? Or do you think you'll see leasing on both of those over the next few years?","Dan Schlanger","Hey, Simon, good morning. I'll take the first one and hand it over to Jay for the second one. The quarterly pacing, there's nothing really to point out other than I would say that some of that small cell pacing the 10,000 to 15,000 nodes we're talking about is a little back end loaded, but there's nothing that would be any different than the general pacing we typically see through the business and what we're seeing to 2018 in terms of when we expect to turn on revenue either on a tower site small cell side or services.","Jay Brown","Thanks for the question Simon. I would tell you if you look back over the last couple of decades of winter, the days have been the best for the infrastructure business around now towers and fiber and the deployment of small cells. Anytime there's new spectrum coming to market and you have a commitment from the owners or the operators that hold that spectrum, you see increased leasing activity. So, as the FCC is looking at, how do we compete globally with regards to 5G, I think it\u2019s a combination of network densification and the deployment of additional spectrum.","Some of that spectrum is lying fallow currently in hands of operators that haven\u2019t deployed it. And some of the spectrum that the FCC is looking at, trying to figure out a way to get it deployed and into the hands of operators. I think both of those are supportive of kind of our long-term expectation of growth and point to a longer runway of growth. Specifically on CBRS and C band, I think we will see activity on both macro sites and small cell. But I would tend to believe, we\u2019ll probably see a bigger impact around small cells than we will at macro sites, but I think it will contribute to long-term activity on both assets.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Niknam from Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Niknam","Just one on rising rates. How does the environment change the way you think about discretionary investments in fiber? I think you\u2019ve talked about investing more particularly organically. So I\u2019m just wondering, how you sort of -- how the view evolves in a rising rate environment. And then I guess more broadly, you think the business can continue to grow sort of this longer term 7% to 8% range given the move in rates?","Dan Schlanger","The amount of increase in rates we\u2019ve seen recently doesn\u2019t impact the way we think about discretionary investments at all just because the returns we see on those investments so far exceed our cost of capital, even with those increasing rates. That it\u2019s not going to have any impact on the long-term benefit that we think those investments will generate for us and our shareholders over time.","And as Jay pointed out in his discussion, we\u2019re really excited about all the trends we see, the acceleration in the small cell business, the continued performance in our fiber business. So we think that those investments continue to look really good even in this rate environment and would be -- it would take a pretty substantial increase from here that would change any of that thought from us. So it\u2019s not anything that we would really anticipate to happen. That doesn\u2019t mean that it wouldn't impact any single period like it did in 2019 for us. But the long-term investment profile we feel really good about and excited about.","And as far as can the business continue to accelerate? I think the answer is yes. As we pointed out, small cell business is around 20% growth year-over-year, that\u2019s in line with what we grew -- what we expect to grow in 2018. The fiber solutions business is around 5% growth. We think that\u2019s -- we\u2019ve talked about mid single digit growth for a while now. We think that will continue. So, we think that the position of our assets, the high capacity dense metro assets we put together really gives us a great way to attack multiple markets with the same assets, and we think it will continue to generate growth for us in the long-term.","Matthew Niknam","If I could just follow up, you also mentioned a meaningful portion of the nodes that are coming online in 2019 are going to be collocating. Can you maybe give us a little bit of a ballpark estimate in terms of how that compares to the 70-30 set you\u2019ve given us in the past?","Dan Schlanger","It\u2019s really not a lot different. It\u2019s just that the total amount is a lot higher, because we have such a larger pipeline. We\u2019re still around 70-30 it\u2019s just the total amount of collocation has gone up, which has been very encouraging to us. Because it means that, as we put new assets in place to build small cells, we're then coming back and getting collocation on those new assets. But we're still investing a lot in building out markets which we anticipate will do for a while now just given how early we are in this investment cycle.","Jay Brown","Matthew, I think one of the way to frame it is, if you were to go back two or three years and look at the number of collocations that we're doing now, it would exceed the total number of nodes we were deploying three to four years ago. So, we've seen significant growth in that collocation which is, both Dan and I have comment. We've seen not only terrific returns, but we've also seen the model prove out which has given us more conviction around continuing to invest in the assets and grow the opportunity as we follow the wireless carriers and their deployment of 5G across markets.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Barden with Bank of America.","David Barden","I guess just a couple on the kind of inputs to the AFFO guide. I think the $25 million related to the variable cost funding, Dan implies about a 75% -- sorry, 75 basis point rate hike into 2019. I just wanted to verify that. It sounds pretty consistent with kind of consensus expectations for rising rates. And then the second one was related to the $45 million funding costs related to discretionary CapEx. I guess, the question here is kind of, what is the expectation or is that a 1.5 billion being raised in the middle of the year? Is that a 1 billion being raised at the beginning of the year? Some color on that would help us kind of understand the shape of that.","Dan Schlanger","Sure. Thanks for question David. On the first question, what we baked into our 2019 guidance is forward curve out as of when we put it together, which is very recently. So, it's in the ballpark of what you're talking about, but it's just a forward curve of future interest rates through 2019 which we think will add about $25 million to our interest expense year-on-year. On the $45 million funding, there are lot of assumptions that we put into that, but as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have about $1.5 billion of net capital to spend which when added to our dividend is higher.","There is more capital going out then we would have in AFFO. We're going to have to fund that externally as you know. The mix of that funding and how we're going to do that funding and when is really based on when the nodes come on air over the course of 2019. And then to the extent that we generate additional EBITDA that generate additional debt capacity, we will use that and anything else we would issue equity for to keep our debt to EBITDA on the five times range. And all those assumptions and when and how are baked in, we have ranges around it because those are assumptions and we're going to see how it all plays out.","David Barden","So, the guide implies a stable share count. So, is it safe to assume that the base case expectation then is, is that $45 million is related primarily to debt financing over the course of the year?","Dan Schlanger","Yes. David, I think again, what I would say is, if we were looking at as a funding philosophy overtime that keeps us around 5 times debt to EBITDA, to the extent that we can fund all of our discretionary capital with additional debt capacity on our EBITDA. We may have to do some equity at some point and want to do some equity at some point to keep our investment grade ratings. And how all that comes together and the timing of all that is something that we're going to have to be very diligent about and looking into how we fund our capital expenditures in 2019. And we have a lot of assumptions that go into that the financing of how we\u2019re going to make it happen. And we\u2019ll let you know, we\u2019re actually -- we\u2019ll just fund it in a way that will maintain where we\u2019re going.","Jay Brown","I think maybe the other way to add David and maybe this is kind of where you\u2019re driving toward. As Dan said, as we factor in those various scenarios around how we need to finance the business to maintain our investment grade credit rating, we factor that into the 45. So, our intention would be to deliver on the AFFO per share, which you can calculate and the dividend growth. We expect to be able to deliver on that, given the funding that we expect in front of us in 2019 of funding about on a net basis, about a $1.5 billion. So we\u2019re factoring in the various financing scenarios and giving that guide.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Markets.","Jonathan Atkin","So two questions. One on the escalator guide for next year, it\u2019s a little off from 2018 levels and I wonder what\u2019s driving that. Is that product mix or anything around term extensions or NOAs? And then secondly in the fiber segment, I\u2019m just kind of interested now that we\u2019re a couple of quarters in. What has surprised you on the upside versus the downside in terms of the business mix, whether it\u2019s e-rates or cell site backhaul or enterprise or what not if you can maybe drill down a little bit into that would appreciate it?","Dan Schlanger","Thanks, Jon. I\u2019ll take the first one again, I\u2019ll hand it over to Jay for the second one. On the escalator, it\u2019s not nominally and it\u2019s not different than anything we would have expected. The tower businesses still just below 3% on an escalator basis, small cells around 1.5%, and fiber solution has no escalator. So any change for a percentage basis is on the business mix, that\u2019s going into that escalator.","Jay Brown","On your second question, Jonathan. As we look at the business particularly Lighttower the largest portion of that. What I would tell you is we\u2019re now almost a year in since that acquisition. And the business has performed in line with what our expectations are, as you\u2019ve seen over the course of this year. We\u2019ve delivered right in line with what where we expected the business to perform. And on the integration front, all of the integration activities have been on track. So we think we\u2019ll come out of this year with the asset largely integrated and financial performance that\u2019s in line with the outlook that we provided when we originally bought the assets.","So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily point to anything as big surprises. We\u2019ve made, we said multiple times that what has surprised us to the plus side is the level of collocation that we\u2019ve been able to achieve on fiber. Now we certainly believe that to be the case when we made the investments into the business. But collocation has occurred at a higher rate and faster than what we initially anticipated. When we\u2019ve underwritten these investments, we\u2019ve taken an approach that\u2019s very similar to what we\u2019ve done with towers, where we assume that we add one tenant over a 10-year period of time or about 0.1 per year.","And what we\u2019ve actually seen is collocation on fiber from small cells in particular, that\u2019s about twice that rate. So, the total return on fiber is driven in part by fiber solutions customers, which you referenced schools and e-rates and other things and the leasing of dark fiber assets to enterprise customers, hospitals, et cetera. And the deployment of small cells and the deployment of small cells has driven that collocation and returns at rates that are higher than what we originally underwrote. And the fiber solutions business as a standalone mix of customers, that\u2019s performed in line with our expectation in the first year of significant ownership.","Jonathan Atkin","And then if I could just briefly follow up in terms of the small cell activity expected next year and then the macro site leasing activity expected next year. Is the customers set and the demands set broadening across a larger number of the big four carriers? Or is it kind of the same customer concentration but just more activity overall by the same principal customers?","Jay Brown","We are seeing activity from all four of the operators on small cells. The broadening as we have talked both the increase in the number of nodes that we are turning on year year-over-year, but also the number of new contracted nodes that we are seeing in the business. That's in part a function which we saw over the course of early 2018. Some of that was the broadening of the customer base and all of them beginning to deploy small cells. But I think more recently, if you took this quarter and what we expect to see into 2019 as the activity accelerates there is really a broadening of the number of markets in which those nodes are deployed.","Historically the vast majority of the activity has been focused in the top 10 markets, and I think a couple of quarters ago I mentioned that we had expanded that out to really NFL cities, and we're continuing to see a deepening of the need for small cells in those NFL cities and then seeing the carriers and some places are start to move out even beyond the NFL cities. But at the moment, the vast majority of the activity would be concentrated in the top 30 markets in the U.S. roughly, which is an expansion from what was a couple of years ago where it was almost exclusively related to the top 10 markets. And that's driving the increased level of activity.","Operator","We will take our next question from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael","I guess first off just going back to the fiber business I was flipping through the Lightower presentation at the time that it was announced, and in there I think there was a comment that you guys are anticipating, 7% growth in today's comments -- excuse me, you are expecting 5% next year. Is that an apples-to-apples comparison? And if so, does that imply obviously than a slowdown in growth? And if so why? Or am I just misinterpreting how to think about that? And then secondly as it relates to the 10,000 to 15,000 small cells that you anticipate deploying in 2019, as we go out further, do you think that that\u2019s a decent number to have in our heads. And I say that because just in terms of the employees that are needed and what's required on your end, can you even go further than faster than that level. And also from a carrier perspective, do you get any sense that they are going to have the ability to grow faster than that even if they wanted to?","Dan Schlanger","On the first one, Jay mentioned this earlier, but one of the things that I have been impressed by in the first year with our Lightower, we gave guidance last year this time before we owned Lightower, and we are coming and we are hitting that guidance. And it's something that during the course of an integration like we are going through which has been a complicated integration as we have talked about before of merging Lightower into Crown Castle and merging a bunch of other fiber companies in the Lightower at the same time. The ability to hit those numbers that we put out before we actually own the business is really impressive and something that I think has been a testament to the people working in the business, but also just the business model itself.","So as we look at the growth that we see going forward, we've talked about the mid-single-digit growth for a while. And we think that that's something that will continue and we're generally in line with what the expectations were and what we expected when we bought the asset and how effective the assets to perform going forward. And as we incorporate all those other fiber assets or fiber businesses that we bought historically into it, we hope we can expand markets and push that on and make it higher, but we think that mid-single-digits is the right expectation have in mind.","Jay Brown","Colby, on your second question, I think, there's two things that are probably important to answer with regards to your question. First, specifically around our current operating capability, we can handle the 10,000 to 15,000 nodes that we're talking about in 2019 without the need to really significant change or materially changed our cost structure. As you can see from the outlook that we're providing, we're assuming sort of normal costs escalations in the business and not staffing up. But due to our capabilities, given that it takes 18 to 24 months in those cases to build these nodes. These are capabilities have been in place for a while and while they turn on in 2019, the work associated with those notes began well before calendar year 2019 to get the work done.","So I think from a capability standpoint, at the moment, we're staffed appropriately to the level of activity that we're seeing. If we, if I think more broadly about the opportunity around small cells, I don't think 10,000 to 15,000 nodes a year it's going to get anywhere close to accomplishing what the carriers have publicly talked about their needs for small cells and the densification that's going to be required for the 5G. And I believe based on our operating capability, our expertise, the assets that we have, and how we develop relationships with both municipalities and our customers, I believe we're going to be the provider of choice as the opportunity scale.","So as I think longer term outside of kind of the periods in which we're getting guidance and the comments that Dan and I were making around our interest and desire to continue to invest, that commentary is based on our belief that the opportunity is scaling and getting larger and we intend and would expect to participate in that. And we want to win and be -- and continue to be the provider of choice to the wireless operators.","So we'll continue to follow them and to the extent that this longer term view, if I'm right about the opportunity continuing to increase in an appointment that's needed, then we may at some point need to add additional resources in order to handle that, but that will come with the appropriate cash flows and returns if that does materialize. So short-term, I think we're in pretty good shape in terms of the way we're organized and have staffed and longer term, we're certainly competing to try to make that opportunity even larger. And if it does, then we'll adjust to ensure we have the capabilities to deliver for customers.","Dan Schlanger","And one other thing, Colby, we mentioned was the capabilities of our customers to accelerate. I think one of the benefits of our business model of being shared infrastructure provider is, if they want to go faster, we'll figure out a way to go faster and that benefits all of our customers. So they somehow figure out that more small cells are needed in 2019 or 2020 or 2024, then 10,000 to 15,000 nodes, we'll make that happen, because we've shown the ability to scale our business. And that helps them because they don't have to pay for the upfront costs, that's really on us and they get to share those economics and it's the best way to deploy small cells is to share them amongst multiple customers because then the cost gets shared. So, we think that our business model is in line we\u2019re trying to accelerate that, as Jay was talking about, and we become the best option for making that happen.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.","Ric Prentiss","I had a couple of questions on the discretionary CapEx items. You mentioned the, I think 2 billion gross, 1.5 billion net. What was that in 2018 as far as where you think you\u2019re going to end up?","Dan Schlanger","It\u2019s about the same Ric, it's in the same ballpark.","Ric Prentiss","Okay. And as we think about that 2 billion for 2019, can you help us peel that back as far as how much you think might be towers versus small cell versus fiber?","Jay Brown","Yes. It\u2019s about $400 million or so in tower and the rest is fiber. As you know, the fiber is a shared asset, so we don\u2019t really break it down between fiber and small cells. It\u2019s the fiber segment in total is the remainder of it.","Ric Prentiss","And that does not include the maintenance capital, right, this is all just discretionary?","Jay Brown","Yes. But we\u2019re giving ranges here, so to describe that, the maintenance cap is relatively small to begin with. So, these are all ballpark figures. So this is all in the range.","Ric Prentiss","And then when you think about 500 million range being contributed back by the carrier. How should we think about, how much of that is coming back from tower versus small cell fiber?","Jay Brown","It\u2019s probably a similar breakdown between how much the total capital is.","Ric Prentiss","And then kind of all it's all related questions together, the change in the amortization of prepaid rent. Are you still looking like something in the mid 30 to 40 million in \u201918? And then should we think that number goes up in \u201919 and given the additional capital contributions?","Jay Brown","It\u2019s about the same because we\u2019re talking about the growth in prepaid rent. It\u2019s going to be in that $40 million range. $35 million to $40 million range in \u201918 and in \u201919. And because capital is the same in both years and contributed capitals the same in both years, it\u2019s about the same amount of growth.","Ric Prentiss","And last one for me. We get a lot of questions on Sprint and T-Mobile obviously it\u2019s a hot topic out there. I think in your supplement, you mentioned Sprint was 14% of your total lease revenues or rental revenues with seven years left. Can you break out how much Sprint is on your macro towers because a lot of people are thinking that might be where the more exposure to potential churn might be?","Dan Schlanger","Yes, it\u2019s in that ballpark Ric. There's no real difference between that. So it\u2019s around, it\u2019s in that 14% range for the Sprint contribution to our macro business. Yes.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski","One of the questions in terms of the pace of small cell deployments, I mean we\u2019ve seen some of the new regulations come out by the FCC to sort of try and reduce some of the timing on in terms of deployment. How do you see that sort of impacting the opportunity for you folks going forward here? Could we see a further step up by operators to deploy at a quicker rate? And then sort of as follow-up question. I mean, clearly you folks have made a lot of investments over the last couple years and building up necessary fiber and putting the assets in place to capitalize on this opportunity. As we start to think about this opportunity going forward, I mean clearly collocation is going at a faster rate than you folks had anticipated. Do you believe that this provides you with a very differentiated completive opportunity or should I say very sustainable differentiation and capitalizing a greater share of the small cell deployment as network evolve to embrace that type of technology?","Jay Brown","Sure. On your first question, I believe the deployment of both fiber and small cell is forever going to be a very localized business. So what the FCC did last month is helpful to the industry to the wireless carriers and to ourselves by making clear what the underlying fees are associated with deploying and the public right of way and then setting forth some timeline, which municipalities are expected to respond to request in order to do that. So, what it does as it gives a clear line of sight both in terms of cost and timing. But it in no way negates the necessity and the importance of us continuing to work with those municipalities as we manage and deploy the infrastructure in ways that are sensitive to the aesthetic and the needs of the local community.","So I wouldn't look at that and assume that we're going to see a material change in our 18 to 24 month deployment cycle. In fact, we don't believe that will result. But we do believe that it is helpful in some problematic municipalities where they've been absolute basically blockers to the deployment of the technology and the deployment of fiber and small cells in the public right of way. So in some places, we may actually see a little bit of benefit, but I think on the whole what you should expect is our deployment cycle will continue to be in that 18 to 24 months range, and the FCC order is helpful as the scale of the deployment, as I was mentioning earlier moves well past just the top 10 markets and moves across the larger portion of the U.S., as it gives us greater visibility on what the economics are going to look like and the timing of approvals et cetera at the local level.","On your second question, this is very similar our view in the deployment of fiber to what we saw with towers, which is the low cost provider, ultimately wins the day. And we've invested in an asset that can be shared across multiple customers thereby lowering the cost of those customers and whether the customers the university, school district or a wireless carrier who's looking to deploy small cell. That shared fiber asset means that we're able to deliver to them a very low cost provision of that fiber. And in markets where we have and own the fiber we do believe over the long term that low cost will win and it will attract additional customers as they look for the lowest cost alternative and the deployment of their network.","As we look at opportunities outside of the markets that we're in, we may see an opportunity for us to continue to invest capital and expand the portfolio of assets that we have or it may be that the returns are such that we choose to just own the assets that we build in the top markets that we've done thus far. And we see the model transition more towards the collocation model. So it just depends on how the market develops and where the returns are, whether we continue to expand the footprint or utilize the assets that we've acquired to date.","But as I mentioned in my comments, what has been clear in the early days of this is that having the asset in place drives what we fundamentally believe was the business model when we got into this business that it's a shared asset just like towers. And our goal is to put as many tenants on that shared assets as we possibly can, and the benefits customers at low cost provision and it benefits us is as it increases financial returns and that's the way we're seeing the business play out and pretty excited about where we're positioned relative to the deployment schedules that are ongoing around 5G.","Dan Schlanger","And as you pointed out, Amir, just to add a little bit to that, we do believe we have sustainable advantages, especially in the markets where we have built fiber and have a pretty broad expanse of that fiber within a market. It's hard to come in and overbuild and try to compete on price and try to compete on network quality and try to compete on all of the capabilities that Jay talked about. So as this market would expand, if it expands and we believe it will, I think we hope to maintain that competitive advantage and press on it. As we invest in future markets that Jay talked about but especially in the markets we're already in, we think that we are in a really good spot.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.","Nick Del Deo","First, if we go back to your Q1 2017 earnings call, you guys know that you had about 25,000 small cell nodes on air at the time, and you said that your backlog number of nodes on air would approximately double after 18 to 24 months. So, we don't know the exact cadence with those installations, or how the pricing for those nodes compared to the installed base, but it still seems like it would have been sufficient to drive an increase in small cell revenue in '19, in excess of what you guided to. So can you talk a bit about what might bridge that gap? Or alternatively, if there's something wrong with the notion that if you're on air node count doubles your small cell revenue should roughly speaking also double?","Dan Schlanger","So a couple of things I would point to. Broadly, if you think about what has happened over the last couple years and you look at revenue growth, if you look at our revenue growth in 2017, and then look at the revenue growth that we're expecting in 2019 from small cells, it is basically a double from in terms of revenue growth over that over that period of time. So that, that come that's one way of thinking about it.","Second thing, I would point out to you is as we talked about the average of deployment cycles of 18 to 24 months, depending on where that falls, that can have a little bit of an impact of the pacing of that. And you'd have to look at both the pacing in 2017 and when those came on air, and then also the pacing in 2019. And those two things could have, if you were trying to put a really fine point on a couple of million dollars to figure out where that falls one way or the other. The timing in both period could affect the way that that those numbers fall out.","As I've talked about, on this call this morning, from a return standpoint, we haven't seen the returns change at all over that several year period of time. So we haven't seen any real change in pricing as a result of that. So it's not a pricing difference, I think you're probably just looking at a bit of timing differences and when this when this activity falls, and obviously if some portion of the nodes that we're talking about in 2019 fall towards the second half of the year, then the financial impact in calendar year 2019 is relatively small.","Last thing, I would mention to you is, I think probably the best indication of how we're performing on this front is the statement of customers and how we're doing on winning additional nodes. And as I made the point in my comments, I mean our pipelines up about 40% year-over-year from this time last year. So, we're delivering on the customer commitments that we've made and that's resulting in those customers giving us increasing levels of activity because we're the best provider in the market and they believe us to be able to deliver on the goal.","So I think if you look at revenue growth, if you look at returns which have stayed the same and then you look at kind of activity and what we\u2019re seeing as additional business from the customers. I think all of those signs point to the fact that the business is performing in line with what we expected in \u201919 at this point looks like it\u2019s shaping up to be a pretty good year in terms of the deployment of additional nodes.","Nick Del Deo","And maybe one more on the fiber segment this quarter. It looks like fiber segment revenue grew about a percent sequentially or something less than 1% that we backed out and they should be pay rent. If we assume that small cells are about a quarter that business and they\u2019re growing at a rate in the teens that would imply fiber solutions revenue was flattered down sequentially. Because I know there can be credits and settlements and stuff like that, that can swing things around. But is there anything going on there is that we should be cognizant of?","Jay Brown","Yes, Nick, there\u2019s nothing really to be going on there, and I think that\u2019s borne out in our 2019 guidance. We really look at the trajectory of the growth of this business has been pretty consistent in that mid-single-digit range. And any quarter-over-quarter move, like you\u2019re talking about is it may not go exactly stair step, but we think generally speaking, it\u2019s going to go up in that 5% range year-over-year. And there shouldn\u2019t be huge differentials in quarter-to-quarter moves. But if there are there, there\u2019s nothing that would, we think we would want to call out or pull your, put your attention to, or else we would actually do that in a way that would make it pretty clear. But there\u2019s nothing that happened in the third quarter that would rise to that level.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Richard for Phil. Given your commentary about the backlog and the amount of small cells that might be meeting to come online, it seems like, we might be ramping from the 10 to 15 to something higher. Should we expect CapEx and OpEx to come up longer term as these are the returns are very good? So it\u2019s worth it. But how should we think about that opportunity and the impact on CapEx and OpEx?","Dan Schlanger","Thanks for the question, Richard. On the OpEx side, as we put these nodes on air, the margins are in the neighborhood of about 60%, roughly. So there\u2019s going to be operating expense that we see track with those, with the deployment of nodes. Specifically, as Dan mentioned earlier about 70% of what we\u2019re putting on our new systems and about 30% are collocations. So I think on a blended basis, somewhere in the neighborhood of about 60% is probably the right guidance in terms of impact of OpEx or direct OpEx.","From a CapEx standpoint, we talked about what we\u2019re turning on air in '19 and the capital spending that we think there will be in 2019. If you\u2019re trying to go out further than that, I think you have to start to make us scale decision. And I\u2019ll leave that to you in terms of how much you want to scale the business beyond the level that we\u2019re seeing currently. For a like level of activity, I would assume a like amount of capital that would be the guidance that I would give you.","And if you want to scale it up or down from there, I think you can scale the capital relative to that, and I think that\u2019ll be a pretty good answer. And then maybe the last component to round out on the OpEx side, around the staffing levels that we have in place for the deployment of small cells. We believe we\u2019re appropriately sized at the moment for delivering on those 10,000 to 15,000 per year. And then if we see a scale increase from there, or I guess a decrease then we\u2019ll adjust the cost structure appropriately, but without having a specific number to talk to it's difficult to give you that.","I think what I would say is, if the returns stay as they are and then we are happy to put additional investment around our ability to deploy nodes, and we think those will be attractive returns and if they are not then we would pass on the opportunity or pass on the investment opportunity. But if everything holds as it is now and we are certainly hopeful we are going to continue to see the business. We will be happy to make investments around the capabilities to continue to deployment scale if the market has the opportunity to.","Nick Del Deo","I guess my question was more --it seems like you're implying that there's a bigger opportunity and you're seeing a bigger backlog. Am I taking that the wrong way?","Dan Schlanger","Oh, no, we are definitely seeing a bigger opportunity. I think I'm just trying to limit my comments to -- calendar year 2019 rather than go out beyond 2019. So, we are certainly pointing to the fact that there's lots of early seeds that would suggest that the business is going to continue to scale and grow. And as we get into calendar year 2019 and start to think about giving guidance for 2020 then we will be happy to update you on what the cost structure looks like.","Nick Del Deo","And then finally, can you talk about -- give us a little more color on churn? There is a lot going on there I know. What are you seeing in terms of churn with towers, small cells and fiber, if we just go through that I think that would be helpful?","Dan Schlanger","Sure, Richard. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the tower churn is on the high end of our 1% to 2% range, so call it around 2% on towers. More than half of that is from the remaining acquired network churn. Just to give you some background on that, I know you remember that we had in our supplement historically provided some acquired network churn over time that was because of the -- we thought that that acquired network churn was going to push our overall tower churn above the 1% to 2% historical range. So we wanted to get additional color on that.","But now that we are back in that range we've taken that disclosure out because we think this 1% or 2% is indicative of what the future is going to look like, including for 2019. But if you look at the last disclosure we had beyond 2020 we are somewhere between 35 million and 60 million so we are seeing the churn that we expected from those acquired networks over this year and that\u2019s what pushed us up to the higher end of the range but we are still within our historical 1% to 2%.","On the small cell side, we are really not seeing a whole bunch of churn to speak at all so less than 1% of what we said but it\u2019s a pretty small number. I think that both indicative of the early stage we're in but also have been speaking for the business overall that once the small cells are installed it's very difficult to get off of those small cells because we are providing service to customers.","On the fiber side we are in the high single-digits range and so when you add all of those things up you get into that number that's around the $175 million overall churn that we put in our outlook.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","Thanks, I actually wanted to go back and ask you guys a follow up on Dave's question earlier in the call when he was talking about your funding plan for the year, and I think this is the way I interpreted Dan's answer, but let me know if I'm wrong. It sounds like you determined over the course of the year, it was appropriate to issue equity financing then obviously your share count will be higher than it is now. But I also -- I think I heard that it's possible your interest expense may end up being lower cause you wouldn't necessarily have to issue as much debt as maybe is embedded in the interest expense assumptions in your guidance? Is that a fair interpretation of those comments?","Dan Schlanger","It is Brett.","Jay Brown","It is Brett. Yes.","Brett Feldman","Okay. Good, now, I'll ask a business question then. There's been a lot of focus on sort of what's been driving power leasing activity in the U.S. this year. And there seems to be an embedded assumption that the year has been sort of ramping in part because projects have been ramping, whether it's first net or things other carriers are doing. And so as you were trying to think about, what was an appropriate outlook for your tower business for 2019? And we know that you think you're going to have more new leasing activity then you saw this year. Are you sort of saying that you're comfortable that the exit rate of 2018, which is a higher exit rate than you started the year at, is sustainable? Or is there something else more nuanced in terms of how you got there? And then just as an extension of that, how sensitive is that outlook to whether or not Sprint and T-Mobile actually starting to combine your businesses in the second half of 2019?","Jay Brown","You know, Brett, I think that we -- when we look at this item and I would say this about towers leasing or small cells or fiber solutions. When we give the outlook, we obviously don't have perfect visibility for what's going to happen over the next 12 months. So we base the outlook on both the activity that we're seeing currently and then the conversations that we're having with our customers and what those conversations lead to in terms of our expectations for financial results for the ongoing year.","So for 2019, that I think the answer to your question around tower leasing is it's a combination of, it's a combination of both of those things. So we have seen an accelerating leasing environment over the course of 2018. Then there are a number of events whether you want to talk about first net, at the deployment of 5G, general upgrades and the network and diversification efforts that are ongoing. All of those things are factoring into our expectation for 2019. And it is an elevated level of activity that we would expect to continue throughout the course of all of the 2019.","For our assumptions as we thought about those, that leasing activity, with regard specifically to T-Mobile and Sprint that you asked about, we have assumed that they will continue business as usual in those assumptions. And I think based on the comments that T-Mobile has made, publicly with regards to the acquisition of Sprint, it's very clearly designed and their intention is to make significant investments around the deployment of 5G at levels that would exceed those of both what T-Mobile and Sprint have done independently on a combined basis.","And so, we would look at that and say, we assume that model continues to play itself out. And that reflects our level of activity for 2019. Obviously it depends to some degree, the second part of your question there, on the timing of that combination and what the impact is even to the positive or to the negative, depending on when the combination happens. But at the moment, they're independent companies and we're seeing them operate as such. And so we base our outlook based on the activity that we're currently seeing for them.","Brett Feldman","And I would imagine that if, you're on the middle of the year, and they started to execute leases, which probably wouldn't even put in place till later in the year. At that point, you're kind of locked into the remainder of the year anyway, even if they decided to modify what they're doing and say, 2020 or longer. Is that fair?","Jay Brown","Yes, that's the nature of the businesses, six months, six months into calendar year 2019 at that point, the vast majority of everything that will be turned on air the carriers have committed to. And then if you think about small cells or what happens on the small cell side, that activity was lower than committed to a couple of years ago. So we have some visibility around when that will turn on. So events that happen as we get towards the certainly as we get towards the middle of the second half of the year have very little to no impact to the financial results in that calendar year.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Rollins from Citi.","Michael Rollins","Just a few follow ups, if I could. First, on the description that some of that churn, the towers is getting pulled in. Does that also create an accelerated amount of payment for the customers to exit a lease early? And if so, is that in the guidance? And then if I could also then follow-up on the fiber business. Can you talk a little bit more about what goes in new leasing activity and churn? So for example like price increases, price decreases, service upgrades or downgrades. How you treat that within the revenue bridge? And is fiber churn that you\u2019re expecting for 2019. Is that a normal year of churn or are there some helps or hurts that we should just be thinking through?","Dan Schlanger","I\u2019ll take the first one Mike. Thanks for the question. I wasn\u2019t trying to say that our churn was being pulled in. The thing is there\u2019s acquired network churn that is in line with what our expectations have been. And so, they\u2019re not accelerated payments that we would have in our guidance to have that. It\u2019s just churn that we expected and it\u2019s coming in as we expected. On the fiber side\u2026","Jay Brown","Yes. On the fiber side, on the churn, this is this is probably a bit of a difference between the way we typically historically talked about what happens in the tower business and some of what happens in the fiber business. And we\u2019ve chosen to just sort of conform to the industry norm. So I\u2019ll give you an example. In the tower business, if a customer comes out and wants to add an amendment and put additional antennas on an existing array. Historically, as the tower industry we\u2019ve called that an amendment and taking that additional revenue in the form of an amendment.","In the fiber business, they actually count the legacy lease as churn and then put in a new lease that\u2019s post the legacy dollar amount and then the new amended rate. And so in some ways causes churn to look elevated beyond what we would think about in the tower business as churn. In the tower business, the churn means that the customer went away and there was no replacement of revenue. In the fiber business, you have a component of what I just described as an amendment, where the customer very well may end up paying more for the services as they take on additional capacity in the fiber network.","And in some cases you have occasions where a large enterprise will move office buildings and go to a new location. And you have an asset there and potentially a new tenant that moves into the building and you release that same fiber network and at a cost of virtually little to no additional capital investments. Again that\u2019s counted as churn even if the entire revenue stream is replaced by the tenant taking over that location. So in some respects I think you could look at the 9% number and say, it\u2019s a higher percentage than is actually functionally happened in the business as we experienced churn.","But we\u2019ve just sort of taken the course of let\u2019s continue to report the number in a way that\u2019s consistent way. Others have thought about the fiber business consistent with the way Lightower thought about the business given that they had public debt and then in a number of meetings and explain the business. But all of that I would say well, maybe helpful for your own thinking about what the impact is for the business.","At the end of the day, the right way to think about the business is what's the net revenue growth which is why we talk about Dan talked about kind of the specific net growth in the fiber business around 5% net growth. We think that's a good assumption, and we believe we can continue to operate the business in the mid-single digits of growth at the revenue line there. And obviously that bolsters our total returns on fiber.","Michael Rollins","That's very helpful. And would you describe.","Dan Schlanger","Sorry Mike, I just want to make sure I answered all of your questions. I think you also mention is there anything that's abnormal in the year around churn, nothing that we would point to. We think 2019 at least at this point we expect that to be a normal year. So our expectation of high-single digit churn in that business, there is nothing in there that I would point to as abnormally to pluses or minuses.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Robert Gutman from Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Gutman","So prepaid rent on the fiber side has been volatile this year, is this reflecting small cell CapEx reimbursements? And then, should we infer that there were fewer deployments in the third quarter versus the second quarter? And then little more broadly, can you say what you expect the total small cell deployments over the course of this year could be versus that longer term 10,000 to 15,000 target?","Dan Schlanger","So thanks Robert. On the prepaid rent, the answer to your question is, yes. Most of that increase in prepaid amortization is related to capital contributions that we get for the deployment of additional small cells. It happens as that capital is being spent and then being reimbursed. It is not directly in line with the number of notes put on air in that same period. So you cannot look at it quarter-over-quarter and make an assumption or draw a conclusion around what the level of activity is in that quarter because those things are not always aligned.","We spend and get capital in ways that are much more aligned with milestones and payments and it has, it's very difficult to try to equate that directly to how many nodes go on air in a quarter? I think year-on-year you can make a better view of that, but even that starts getting a little skewed depending on when they come on air and when we gotten paid for them. But generally speaking, the prepaid rent amortization has to do with those capital contributions because those are generally speaking again similar '19 than they are in '18, the growth in prepaid rent is going to be about the same in '19 as it is in 2018.","Jay Brown","On your second question around nodes, this year, we'll probably put somewhere in the neighborhood of 6,000 to 8,000 on air roughly next year we'll be in that 10,000 to 15,000 range.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Spencer Kurn from New Street Research.","Spencer Kurn","So, we're seeing carrier strike deals for the number of municipalities to leverage the city's infrastructure for small cell deployments. And I'm just curious, do these agreements impact the way that you compete or the way you look at the overall opportunity in these types of markets relative to markets for carriers you haven't made these types of deals?","Jay Brown","Thanks Spencer. We not only have the carriers done that, but we have done that in instances where we're work with municipalities and strike a deal with the local municipality in order to be able to deploy small cell. So, the deals are helpful because somewhere to the order from the FCC. They give line of sight in terms of what's required and the timelines that are required and what the economics are. And so it's not, I don't think it's anything unusual not what I point to it as that changing to the, to the business model or the timing is just normal course of dealing that we would find in the market. And I don't believe anything that the FCC has done will really change that.","And then as I made my comments earlier, what the FCC has done is really given better line of sight around the economics and timing. And so to the extent that as we work with municipalities and figure out what the right local solution is, it certainly gives some guidelines and guardrails to what that conversation should look like and what the outcome will ultimately be. So, I think you're probably less likely to see things that kind of hit the paper per se, given the guidelines and guardrails that the FCC has put in place. But I wouldn't be completely surprised if you don't continue to see the municipalities strike deals with carriers or with ourselves in order to do things that our markets specific.","Spencer Kurn","Yes, actually, so my question wasn't so much about the ability to strike deals with municipalities, but it was about sort of how you compete in cities or if your returns are different in cities where a carrier like Verizon has struck a deal with a municipality to use their infrastructure versus another market where they haven't, and I was just curious if, the way you look at the returns you can generate are any different or if it's sort of just normal course of business and it doesn't really matter?","Jay Brown","For the most part the infrastructure is deployed in the public right of way. So if your question is going to their discriminatory pricing among providers inside of that public right of way, I would tell you that one it's not permissible by law to have discriminatory pricing. So the deals that use these struck either by ourselves or by the carriers are for the benefit of anyone who would operate inside of the public right of way for a similar deployment of infrastructure. So I think, again, back to my comments, I think it's an relatively normal activity that you're going to see providers who are funding play infrastructure go through that process with local municipalities, and I don't think it has really any implications to the positive or the negative to our business.","Operator","Thank you. This is the last question. We turn it over to Amy Yong from Macquarie.","Amy Yong","Thanks for squeezing me in. And I was wondering if you could comment on your recent standard deal with T-Mobile obviously they've been clearing 600, they've chosen you as their preferred partner in their small cell deployment. Wondering, if you could share any components of this deal respectful of obviously any kind of customer confidentiality, but components of the deal you're willing to share and also if it contemplated at all T-Mobile and Sprint?","Dan Schlanger","Amy, I hate to do this to you on your last question of the day, but we don't like to comment specifically on individual customer relationships. Obviously, they were kind enough to give us credit for the role that we're playing in the deployment of their network, and we've done a significant amount of business with T-Mobile and are doing a significant amount as they referenced in their press release of the need for 5G and the important role that Crown Castle has played for them, both in what we've done so far and what we're going to do.","And I would just tell you, it really goes across the board across multiple carriers. We're focused on delivering for those customers based on their needs around 5G and they're going to need a lot of, they're going to need a lot of, they\u2019re going to need a lot of small cell nodes and they\u2019re going to have to spend a significant amount of capital to densify their networks in order to deliver on their 5G commitments. And our asset sits in a sweet spot for that.","So, we\u2019re working with all of the carriers and certainly we have conversations around how we think the world will develop and what their needs will be. And then our aim is to be able to deliver a solution that works for them, it\u2019s the low cost provision. And then also delivers to shareholders, the returns that we need to deliver in order to drive an increasing dividend of 7% to 8% per year over the long-term.","Jay Brown","Well, thanks, everyone for joining us this morning on the call.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Son Nguyen. Please go ahead, sir.","Son Nguyen","Great. Thank you, Hannah, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our first quarter 2015 results.","With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and Risk Factors section of the company's SEC filings. Our statements are made as of today, April 23, 2015, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","In addition, today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Brown","Thanks, Son and good morning, everyone. We started 2015 with a great first quarter. The US wireless carriers continue to make investments to upgrade their networks to keep pace with increasing consumer wireless demand. And we expect to see strong leasing activity throughout 2015.","Turning to the first-quarter results, on slide three, site rental revenue grew 3% year-over-year from $747 million to $768 million. Organic site rental revenue grew 5% year-over-year, comprised of approximately 3% growth from cash escalations in our tenant lease contracts and approximately 6% growth from new leasing activity, net of approximately 4% from non-renewals.","Moving to slide four, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO exceeded the high-end of our previously provided first quarter 2015 outlook. As mentioned in our earnings release yesterday, the outperformance during the quarter includes the timing of two items that impact first quarter 2015 results as well as our second quarter 2015 outlook.","First, network services gross margin contribution was higher than our expectations for the quarter by approximately $9 million due to network services activity that was previously expected to occur during the second quarter taking place during the first quarter. ","Second, sustaining capital expenditures during the first quarter was lower than expected by approximately $6 million. This expected $6 million in sustaining capital expenditure is expected to be invested during the remainder of 2015.","Ignoring the benefit from the timing of these two items, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO for the first quarter would be at or higher than the midpoint of our previously provided outlook for the first quarter.","Turning to investment activities, as shown on slide five, during the first quarter, we invested $205 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $17 million in sustaining capital expenditures and $24 million in land purchases. During the first quarter, we completed over 500 land transactions, of which 20% were purchases with the remainder being lease extensions.","For the full year 2015, we are targeting completing over 2000 land transactions. Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business and as we look to control our largest operating expense and produce stable and growing cash flow over time. Today, approximately one-third of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own and approximately 70% on land we own or lease for more than 20 years.","This number increases to 90% when we include ground leaser of 10 years or more. Where we have ground leases, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years. More detailed information regarding the ground interest beneath our towers is available in our supplemental information package on our website.","Of the remaining capital expenditures, we invested $164 million in revenue generating capital expenditures, consisting of $96 million on existing sites and $68 million on the construction of new sites, primarily small cell construction activity. We continue to see significant growth in site rental revenues from small cells, which grew in excess of 35% year-over-year. ","Today, small cells represent 7% of our site rental revenue and site rental gross margin. Small cells offer a shareable model, similar to towers that provides wireless carriers with a solution to address network capacity constraints where a macro tower site is not available or is insufficient. Our investment in small cell anchored builds typically generates 6% to 8% initial yield and gross margins of 60 to 70%. ","With the colocation of the second tenant on the initial fibre investment, we typically see incremental margins of 80% to 90%, bringing IRRs above the 20% level. We believe investing in small cell builds on our core confidence -- builds on our core competency as the leading provider of US wireless infrastructure, leveraging our existing relationships with the wireless carriers.","Like towers, tenant leases on small cells are typically long-term with 10 to 15 year committed term with annual escalators. Given what we are seeing from the wireless carriers and their public commentary, we believe we are in the very early stages of small cell adoption and deployment.","Similar to towers built in the late 1990s and early 2000s, we are focused on building small cell networks in the most attractive locations in the US, in places like Manhattan, Washington DC, Southern California and Chicago. As mobile data demand grows, the necessity of small cells increase as evidenced by our growing pipeline of over 2500 anchor builds and colocations on existing systems, which have been awarded to us, but are not yet in construction.","Today, inclusive of our acquisition of NextG in 2012, we have invested approximately $1.7 billion in small cells. Our current yield on investment is 7%, inclusive of our $1 billion investment in NextG at an initial yield of approximately 4%. With our leadership position of over 14,000 nodes on air or under construction, and 7000 miles of fibre, we are winning new opportunities and driving yields up on our existing investments in small cell networks. ","Shifting to financing activities, during the quarter, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.82 per share or $274 million in aggregate. As of March 31, our total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA is 5.3 times. We continue to maintain a target leverage ratio of five times as we remain focused on achieving an investment-grade credit rating. ","Our weighted average cost of debt stands at 4.1% with a weighted average maturity of six years. We believe overtime, our disciplined approach to leverage and capital allocation, including our dividend policy will lower our cost of capital. A core strategy of the company is to reduce our cost of capital and thereby increase the value to shareholders of our large and growing annuity like business.","Turning to the second quarter outlook on slide six, on a sequential basis, the second-quarter 2015 outlook for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO are expected to be impacted by certain seasonal or timing items. Repair and maintenance during the second quarter of 2015 is expected to be higher by approximately $4 million as compared to the first quarter, reflecting the seasonal nature of certain activities consistent with prior years as the weather warms.","As mentioned in the press release, the expected sequential movements in our outlook for network services gross margin and sustaining capital expenditures are attributable to timing as expectations for network services gross margin as well as sustaining capital expenditures remain substantially unchanged from the previously provided full year 2015 outlook.","Moving on to the full-year 2015 outlook on slide seven, we have increased the midpoint for our full-year 2015 outlook for site rental revenue by $7 million and AFFO by $3 million. The increased outlook reflects the strong results from the first quarter and includes the negative impact from a decrease in foreign exchange rate assumptions related to our Australia business, which is expected to impact site rental revenues and AFFO by approximately $8 million and $6 million respectively.","Given the underlying favourable fundamentals which Ben will speak to in a moment, we remain confident in our ability to generate annual AFFO growth of 6% to 7% organically over the next five years, with cash escalations on our tenant leases contributing to half of the expected growth. We believe this growth combined with returning significant capital to shareholders through dividends provide shareholders with compelling long-term total returns.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.","Ben Moreland","Thanks, Jay and thanks to all of you for joining us today on the call. As Jay mentioned in his remarks, we are focused on providing shareholders with an attractive total long-term return proposition. We measure long-term total returns as dividend yield plus growth in AFFO per share. I'd like to take a moment to explain the composition of the total return profile we offer to shareholders.","Turning to slide eight, based on yesterday's closing stock price, we expect to deliver on average long-term total returns of approximately 10% to 11% per year. This 10% to 11% total returns is comprised of approximately 4% from our current dividend yield plus 6% to 7% from our expectation of growing AFFO per share organically. While the dividend yield ultimately will be determined by the market, we believe our business model given its growth and quality compares very favourably to some of the best in class REITs who have dividend yields of approximately 3%.","Turning to our expected growth, of the 6% to 7% annual growth in AFFO organically, about half of this growth comes from our existing book of business via the cash escalations and our tenant lease contracts. For some context, we currently have approximately $22 billion of high-quality future revenues under long-term contract, primarily with the four largest US wireless carriers. The remaining 50% of expected AFFO growth comes from new leasing activity. This activity is driven by carrier network investments as the carriers deploy more equipment to add capacity and coverage either in the form of new tenant colocation on our sites or amendments to existing locations.","As has been true since the early days of the wireless industry, network quality continues to be the market differentiator for carrier success. Today, the industry is seeing unprecedented data growth on new LTE networks supported by more robust devices and applications. As a result, growing consumer demand and usage is leading to an inevitable need for carrier network investments.","As can be seen on slides nine and 10, there is a strong relationship between consumer usage, unit economics and carrier capital investments. With strong unit economics of approximately $50 per subscriber per month or $600 annually, US carriers are able to generate positive incremental returns on their incremental capital investment.","The relatively high ARPU is supported by the staggering amount of mobile data consumption by US subscribers. As we look to the future, demand for mobile data is seemingly limitless. Cisco's latest report confirms this view, projecting that US mobile data traffic will increase seven-fold between 2014 and 2019 after accounting for Wi-Fi offloading. There are many factors contributing to this insatiable demand for mobile data. However, a couple of things jump out to me including innovation around devices and applications and user demographics.","First, there is an immense amount of innovation taking place around mobile devices and applications. Businesses and consumers are reinventing the way we live and do business, taking advantage of the convenience and accessibility that mobile data provides. For example, there is increasing adoption of Internet TV or over-the-top content offerings. Today, we can stream video on demand on a safer network with applications such as YouTube, Netflix and Hulu just to name a few. Applications such as these drove mobile video data growth of 60% in 2014. And by 2019, mobile data traffic from video is expected to be nine times higher than current levels.","Video enriched content represents an exciting revenue opportunity for wireless carriers and promises to propel the next wave of network investment. Machine to machine, or M2M connections, including wearable devices is another example of an area of innovation that is expected to drive significant growth in data usage.","Today, there is, on average, 1.2 connected devices per US wireless consumer. Amazingly by 2019, that's estimated to be up to 3.2 connected devices for US wireless consumers. Examples of M2M connections include home security and automation, smart metering and utilities and connecting cars. Mobile data traffic generated from M2M connections is expected to double each year between now and 2019.","Turning to demographics, consumer profiles play a significant part in mobile data usage. Applications such as text and email are widely embraced equally across all age groups. However, social networking, video viewing and music streaming are skewed towards younger subscribers, which over time will become a larger percentage of the overall subscriber base.","Subscribers in the age range of 18 to 29 stream video and music at 2 to 3 times the rate of subscribers 30 years old and above. The upcoming change in demographics alone will likely lead to significant increased mobile data demand.","Based on the expected growth in US data growth, we have intentionally been expanding our portfolio of wireless infrastructure in the US by investing in the AT&T mobile tower transactions adding over 17,000 towers and making significant investments in small cell networks over the past few years.","As nearly three quarters of our sites are located in the top 100 markets, we have a tremendous opportunity to capture incremental leasing from increasing cell site density necessary to keep up with demand. Further, we have ample capacity and opportunity to accommodate additional carriers on these sites.","Towers continue to be the most efficient and cost-effective way for carriers to add network capacity and coverage and support our bullish long-term view on site leasing. As Jay has already mentioned, we are also very excited by the small cell opportunity. It's an opportunity for us to extend our leadership position in shared wireless infrastructure.","With initial yields of 6% to 8%, which is higher than a typical tower acquisition yield, and the same underlying shareable model, that leads to IRRs above 20% with the second tenant added, it clearly meets our return thresholds. We believe small cells is a great investment and we are at the very early stages of this opportunity.","Three years ago when we acquired NextG Networks, the then leader in the field of small cells or distributed antenna system deployment, we had a thesis that this architecture of fibre-fed deployment will play an important role in adding capacity to networks of the future as carriers seek to monetize the data opportunity.","Today, our investment thesis has been validated beyond our expectations as we examine the large and growing pipeline of system developments or deployments upon which we are engaged, it\u2019s apparent this is not a niche technology. Rather, it promises to be the solution to add capacity in virtually every urban and suburban geography in the US. Just like towers, some of the best assets will be those that were secured early, where co-location, upgrades and expansion is virtually assured.","So in summary, we are pleased with the start of the year and very excited about the long-term trends that promise to bring more opportunity for Crown Castle to assist our customers in realizing their objectives.","In so doing, we believe our capabilities and portfolio of assets will continue to provide an attractive investment for shareholders and a great place to work for employees. ","And with that operator, I\u2019d be pleased to turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our first question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. Ben, can you just talk a little bit about carrier activity through the year. We saw some very low CapEx from AT&T and Verizon this first quarter. Were you seeing any impact from people waiting to see what they ended up within the AWS auctions and is there a sort of a sense that activities picking up through the year and then for Jay, you mentioned your investment grade target, you're getting pretty close now to that five times, what do you think the path and the timing is here to actually close the deal on that? Thanks.","Ben Moreland","Sure, Simon. Thanks for the question. As we look at carrier activity, it's shaping up pretty much like we thought for the year. I think on the Verizon call, they intimated a little bit back-end loaded on CapEx spending, reconfirming their guidance for the whole year. ","That's probably what we are seeing, little back-end loaded, but that's consistent with how we originally forecasted guidance and to just sort of think about how various carriers ebb and flow with their network enhancements and their capital spending, we've gotten to the point where we don't get really that worked up about individual carriers and individual quarters of how it shapes up. ","It's gotten fairly consistent across the years and sort of the inevitability of the need for cell site density and more upgrades on existing sites. We are seeing each of the carriers work on increasing network quality in their own way and they talk about it publicly and obviously with us and that's what we work on every day. So I'd say it's shaping up about like we thought and perhaps a little bit back-end loaded.","Jay Brown","On your second questions, I'm not really able to provide you with a path or a timing necessarily on when we will get there, but what I can tell you is we've had a number of conversations with each of the rating agencies and have been engaged in an ongoing dialog on the subject for the last -- over a year around achieving the investment grade credit rating. ","And as you point out, rightly point out, as we are nearing the leverage target, the vast majority of our credit metrics are, if not, within very close to meeting their published criteria for achieving an investment-grade credit rating. So we\u2019re optimistic and pleased with where we've gotten to in the approach that the agencies have taken towards upgrading the credit over the last 18 months to two years and we think we\u2019re on the right path, just don't know the exact timing of that.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thank you.","Ben Moreland","Sure.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Barden with Bank of America.","David Barden","Hey, guys. Thanks. Thanks for the details on the small cell business, 7% of revenue, I think this is the first time that you may have shared it. It\u2019s also 7% of the site rental margin as well, which suggests that even at this stage of development, the small-cell business is generating margins that are equivalent with the totality of the business, and I guess that\u2019s a little surprising given that these are mostly presumably one tenant businesses thus far and they could advance from here, could you kind of elaborate a little bit on the kind of cost structure and margin opportunity that's developing in the small-cell business? Thanks.","Ben Moreland","Sure, David. That speaks to the initial yield differential between a typical tower you would acquire or a small cell system you might build. As we mentioned, across our entire cumulative investment, we're at 7% today, which is pretty staggering, given that 1 billion of that came at 4%, three years ago, as we remember with NextG. So obviously that incremental 700 million had to do pretty well. And obviously we\u2019ve grown NextG appropriately as we would have forecasted.","So it reflects that initial higher yield on invested capital and then the very high incremental margins from colocation and we are staying colocation and on a significant number of the original NextG systems, where we are adding to that existing plant as well as additional laterals off of it. So from a financial perspective, we are extremely comfortable with what we see going forward.","I guess maybe to broaden your question a little bit, the challenges are around deployment. We are extremely busy, as Jay mentioned, about our backlog, we've got a lot going on, we've added a lot of people to that business, it's not all capitalized, so we've got overhead dragging that business a little bit, but we\u2019re thrilled with what we see in terms of the opportunity and more and more, as we really dig into the engagements that we\u2019re getting and you look at the geographies.","You come to the conclusion as I mentioned in my notes, it's not a niche product, it's not and it's somewhat random actually, you're saying capacity needs in so many urban and suburban areas that you can quickly start to figure out that we're talking about a universe here, I think of hundreds of thousands of nodes over time. ","Obviously, we will never be able to accomplish all of that ourselves, there will be many other people in this market, but the size of the opportunity honestly reminds us a little bit of, that\u2019s where the the early days of towers and we are going about as fast as we possibly can.","David Barden","Thanks, Ben. And Jay, if I could follow up with one question just on the churn side, it looks like you trimmed a little bit the expectation for non-renewals in this year, is that on the Sprint-Nextel side or is that on the other kind of acquired carrier side and how do you kind of see the moving parts now moving for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Yeah, Dave. We really don't see much of a change from our previous expectations around churn, so for the full year, we basically expect to see about the same amount of churn as we did previously, maybe a little bit of it has been pushed out further in the year. So on a percentage basis, it\u2019s moved a little bit, but there is nothing underlying that tenth of a basis point there that we saw moving the numbers, no real change in our expectation or actual activity to any meaningful amount. ","David Barden","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we will go to our next question with Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. ","Phil Cusick","Hey, guys, thanks. Talking about the services side, it seems like the services slowdown pretty highly correlates to the T, Verizon, probably Sprint lower CapEx. Would you anticipate a pretty quick rebound here as carriers ramp CapEx in the second half?","Jay Brown","Yeah, Phil, we made the comments around the timing from first quarter to second quarter and it is obviously challenging for us in the business to necessarily know exactly how things are going to fall out in the year. The services business, because all of the work that we're doing is related to work that\u2019s done on our sites, we have pretty good visibility to the balance of the year around leasing activity.","And so as we went into the year and as evidenced by the fact that we increased the outlook about $15 million on an FX neutral basis for site rental revenue, from a leasing standpoint, the year is shaping up to be maybe slightly better than what we had originally expected. And so our services assumption follows that, that services for the full year are about what we had previously expected.","So I wouldn't get too tied up in sequential quarter to quarter move. It has to do with how the carriers allocate their capital and when they spend it. But for the full year activity looks like it's going to be about the same as what it was in 2014, and so our services business is basically not just that.","Phil Cusick","Okay. And then as I think about, Simon mentioned the leverage getting down toward five times, with the stock trading where it is, why not be looking into to buy some of that back? Are you working on trying to get the rating agencies through before you look at that or should we look at that as being a more near-term possibility?","Ben Moreland","Well, it's always a possibility and you know we are not shy about buying stock, but as you can tell from our results, we're spending pretty much all our free cash flow and a little bit more on what we think are incredibly attractive investment opportunities as we\u2019ve outlined on this call, it\u2019s small cells primarily. And so I look for that to continue, I don't see a huge amount of free cash flow availability to buy stock for the near-term.","And I do think that certainly as we\u2019ve outlined, one of our core strategic objectives is to secure the investment-grade rating, which I think completely sort of maximizes the monetization of the dividend power of this business and then insulates the balance sheet going forward to a decree on just the overall cost to debt long-term. So it's something we are going to focus pretty carefully on. And I think we are on the path to that, hopefully sooner than later.","Jay Brown","I think over the longer term, as you have seen us do for a long period of time, once we get to the targeted level of leverage, so about five times, once we're down there at that level, that will produce borrowing capacity if we're growing EBITDA in and around just for instance $100 million a year, that's creating about $500 million of investment capacity once we get down to that target level of leverage.","So on the short-term I think you're going to see us focus, as Ben mentioned, on getting down to the five times level. And then once we are down there, then we create additional capacity for investment and absolutely stock purchases that are the benchmark against which we compare all the investments that we make in the business.","Phil Cusick","Okay. Thanks, Jay.","Operator","And we will go to our next question with Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you can maybe give us an update on the process involving the Australian segment, and then if you do determine to close the transaction, how do you think about prioritizing the cash. And could you just remind us how you may be able to utilize the NOLs?","Ben Moreland","Sure, Brett. As we've mentioned before, and put out a press release, we are engaged in a process to evaluate the sale of our Australian business. I don't have anything to announce this morning other than to say that that is ongoing and we have a number of very highly qualified folks that we are speaking with about that. And so I don't want to predict the outcome there for you, because it's certainly not complete. If we were to elect and pursue a transaction there and complete a sale, I think we would first approach it from a leverage neutral proposition as we talked about just a moment ago on Phil\u2019s question. So in and around $500 million of proportional debt reduction is sort of required for that.","But that would still leave a significant amount of proceeds available that then we would have for investment opportunity. And just like with any proceeds or capacity we have, we would look to do what maximizes sort of long-term AFFO per share that could include buying stock, it could include buying other assets, continuing to invest around the core business. So all of that is on the table and we will seek to maximize the outcome of those proceeds.","And finally to your last point, Brett, on the tax position, we have the benefit of the NOLs, so there won't be any taxes paid at the corporate level. We also believe that as a REIT, we will generate a significant capital gain inside the REIT, that will then get passed out to shareholders in the form of the next amount of dividend that we pay will be in fact capital gain treatment. So to the extent we were paying in and around $1.1 billion of dividends on an annual basis, that capital gain would go out at a lower tax rate than the ordinary income tax rate that the normal quarterly dividend receives.","Then to the extent the reminder doesn\u2019t in fact cover all the income within the REIT, that's where we could actually use the NOL to make up that gap. So the shorter answer is there is no tax paid at the corporate level and at the shareholder level, to the extent of the gain, it would be a capital-gains treatment is our best estimate today versus ordinary income. So we think that's extremely favorable.","Brett Feldman","Great, thanks for that color.","Operator","And we will go to our next question with Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI.","Justin Ages","Hi, this is Justin in for Jonathan. Thanks for taking the question. If I could just ask further on the investment grade, and I know you said getting down to around 4.1 as your cost of debt, but I was hoping to get more color on the total cost of capital if you are able to reduce to investment grade?","Jay Brown","Well, I think ultimately that's determined by the market. What I would tell you and based on the work that we've done, if there is meaningful benefits to the company over time we believe from achieving investment-grade credit rating, our aim as a business, as we've talked about over the long period of time, we think we can generate a significant amount of shareholder value by the way we add additional revenue to the existing assets that we own, allocate the remaining portion of the capital outside of the dividend distribution, smart investments like we've talked about this morning for small cells. And then thirdly, providing a risk profile of the business that lowers the cost of capital. And there's a lot of things that go into that. Part of it is how we allocate the capital and the percent of that capital that is distributed to shareholders in the form of basically a certain return on investment that's made.","We think another component of that is capital structure so that the business regardless of the cycle that the market may be in, has a view that the business and the balance sheet are sustainable and can continue to achieve a low cost which provides additional certainty to the payment of the dividend. And so I'll leave investors to make their own judgment on where they think ultimately the cost of the equity should fall.","Today, if you look at where our credit rating is and where bonds are trading and if you were to assume that we were at the low end of an investment-grade credit rating, there may be 80 to 100 basis points of a difference in where we would issue a bond, a 10-year bond investment-grade, non-investment grade. So there are certainly some debt costs associated with that and improvement in the overall cost of debt, but more broadly as we speak about this, we think there are more broad implications in terms of how the business achieves a lower overall cost of capital over the long-term and that's why we're focused on it.","Justin Ages","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we will go to Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.","Rick Prentiss","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jay Brown","Hey, Rick.","Rick Prentiss","Hey. Two questions, if I could. First, I think Ben you were mentioning how a lot of the services business \u2013 it might have been Jay, at your own towers, if I remember right, you guys had about 6,000 towers from Sprint back from the old Global Signal acquisition. Are you seeing any activity from a services business standpoint in your guidance for Sprint starting to activate its Spark Project, the 2.5 gigahertz stuff?","Ben Moreland","Yeah. Rick, I think we are going to probably decline to get into specifics around what a particular career is doing on our sites. You know we normally refer you back to them to talk about their own activity, that\u2019s sort of their business. And we've talked about overall, I think to Simon's original question, overall activity we are seeing that\u2019s consistent with what we saw at the beginning of the year and up a little bit as Jay mentioned in our guidance that we\u2019ve trimmed up a little bit for the year of the first quarter. So probably not going to get into a whole lot of specifics there. I would actually make a comment about our services business, though, that's helpful to remind everybody.","In 2014, we grew that business about 40%, which was consistent with the growth in the portfolio really over the last year or so from \u201813 as we brought on the AT&T Towers. So when we projected for 2015 that the services contribution would be similar to what we saw in \u201814, that's also consistent with the portfolio size. So that's effectively what's happening this year is that we are running, we think, pretty well flat to last year's contribution, which is consistent with the size of the portfolio and so just an observation for those that may not be paying that close attention to our history.","Rick Prentiss","Okay. And then a bizarre question next. With Sprint, we understand there is a lot of discussion with vendors, equipment manufacturers about providing vendor financing to help them maybe look at deploying that Spark Project, have you ever considered offering financing to carriers for higher rent?","Ben Moreland","Let me just say this, yes, we have considered it. It has been proposed and when we\u2019ve looked at it, we haven't found it to be an attractive proposition for us, nor a gating factor that determined whether a carrier went on a site or not.","So, obviously, our objective is what we work on every day is getting carriers on our towers and we could not satisfy ourselves at providing financing or not would actually influence the buying decision whether they needed that tower or not. So, typically the carriers have access to capital for many different sources from public markets, vendor financing as you suggest and we have had it proposed a few times and it frankly did not look that compelling to us to actually sway the buying decision and so, we decided so far not to do it.","Rick Prentiss","That makes sense, right. So, a lot more nice to be a tower company than an equipment company. The final question I've got for you is on the small cells, Jay, you mentioned 2,500 anchor or co-los are in backlog awarded but not in construction. How much CapEx should we think is associated with that? And then, you said one of the challenges is just deploying it. Talk to us a little bit about the gating factors there, is it money, is it people, what do we talked about there?","Jay Brown","The 2,500 that I referenced is a combination of anchor builds as well as co-locations on existing systems. The anchor builds, typically when we\u2019re building new anchor builds, we\u2019re spending about $100,000 per node. The majority of that cost is associated with building the fiber, to build the system, where those notes are going to go. The amount of capital necessary as co-locate on existing systems is significantly lower than that.","What I would guide you towards is, if you look at our activity in small cells and the amount of capital that we've been spending over the last several quarters, our forward look is about the level that we\u2019ve spent over the last two quarters if you were to annualize the two to three quarters, if you were to annualize it, maybe trending upwards a little bit. Obviously, as you've heard us talk about this business over time, this is \u2013 it\u2019s directly related to the returns that we see in the business.","So, to the extent that the return stay intact as we see currently, then we\u2019re happy to continue to pursue RFPs and other initiatives that the carriers are launching in various markets to pursue to expand and frankly invest more capital than even our run rate would suggest as long as the return expectations stay the same.","So -- and I think the -- if you think then about what's the biggest hurdle, the hurdle is not necessarily around not having enough capital to pursue it, we have access to plenty of capitals continue to do it. We would be focused on where the returns appropriately reflecting what we like about the business and where we think the growth is and then frankly, do we have enough manpower to achieve and accomplish what the carriers are looking to do.","Ben Moreland","And really it's the gating factors, as you suggested Rick, are really the whole cycle of construction. It\u2019s the designing of the systems with the carriers input, real estate permitting and then real estate rights, securing those rights and then permitting and then the construction and the longer we\u2019re at this, the better we get, we've got a lot of folks that are extremely good at what they do and I think actually by far leading position in the industry in that capability but it hasn\u2019t necessarily shorten us the construction cycle and I'm very convinced it's a significant barrier to entry in this business, because there is a lot to actually building on these systems and getting the carriers installed on time and on budget and we're getting pretty good at that.","Rick Prentiss","If I remember right, it was about $50 million last quarter, $70 million this quarter, so may be a $120 million for the last two quarters in CapEx or may be $240 million to $250 million annual is kind of what you're thinking like?","Jay Brown","That's our current -- that\u2019s our current run rate and to the extent we find more opportunities, we\u2019re happy to invest more capital than that.","Rick Prentiss","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen","Thanks. Jay, what is the expected incremental small cell node revenue connections required to hit the midpoint, high-end and low-end of guidance? Of the 2,500 in backlog, how many will actually generate revenue by the end of December?","Jay Brown","Very little, very little, if any. Typically once we started construction of small cells, we\u2019re in a 15 month to 18 month cycle in most cases. So, those would likely represent activity that will come online in 2016. We have a very healthy backlog of nodes that are currently in construction.","If you look at our total revenue guidance, 2014 to 2015, we\u2019re expecting revenue growth of between $150 million and $160 million in total, and small cells would comprise about $50 million to $60 million of that growth and towers being the remainder $100 million of that growth and that's the way it falls out. Obviously, a number -- when you look at the year-over-year impact, a number of -- meaningful portion of that $50 million to $60 million of growth in small cells are nodes that we\u2019re turning on now during the second quarter that will then produce revenue for the balance of the year.","Kevin Smithen","And then, if I start to look at the 5.0% organic cash growth and 2.3% cap growth and you factor in these small cell connections straight-line and incremental churn, it appears you could see a nice bump up of cap and organic cash leasing growth in \u201816, is that the right way to think about it all else are being equal, knowing what you know today?","Jay Brown","I think -- and we're certainly not going to give guidance this year in 2016 -- for 2016, but what I would tell you is, we've laid out a five-year forecast of how we think AFFO per share growth on an organic basis of about 6% to 7% and add to that the dividend distribution that we're going to make.","Assumed in that is a level of leasing activity similar to what we saw in 2014 and saw in 2015 -- and are seeing in 2015. The change that we expect to see in 2015 to 2016 is a reduction in the impact of churn. In calendar year 2015, we\u2019re expecting the impact of churn to be approximately $115 million and in 2016, as we've laid out our longer-term forecast for the non-renewals, we expect that number to be approximately $75 million in 2016.","So, the pickup that we would expect at least based on our longer-term forecast that we\u2019ve provided to you would be not so much a change in activity, we've assumed a similar level of activity, but in the amount of non-renewables, we\u2019re assuming a reduction in that by about $40 million, thereby increasing the amount of AFFO, you want to think about it that way, or net organic leasing. It's about a 2% increase roughly at AFFO line if you\u2019re comparing 2015 to what would be flowing through those assumptions in 2016 impact.","Kevin Smithen","Got it. And any color on straight-line for next year?","Jay Brown","I wouldn't give you that much -- I wouldn\u2019t get into that much detail on this call. We\u2019ll give 2016 outlook when we get to the third quarter. One thing that I would point it to, which can be helpful if you're looking at that, we are providing a significant amount of detail on that supplemental package and you can see what's currently on the book today and what the burn off of straight-line revenues overtime for years well beyond 2016 and those would reflect all of the leases that are currently signed and producing revenue and you can see how that flows I think out through 2022.","Kevin Smithen","Great, thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much and just following up on the prior question, sort of understanding the longevity of what seems to be a healthy investment environment, it does seem like your expectations are baking in sort of a reduction in the churn impact, which should ease moving away from 2015. I'm sort of sitting back and thinking, we've got commentary out there that Sprint seems to be focused on network densification initiatives, T-Mobile has been vocal about its A-Block spectrum build. Obviously, we just had the AWS-3 spectrum auctions and public safety, if I start to put all of those pieces together, can we find ourselves in a situation in which you have a spending environment that at least as good but potentially better when looking at all these sort of moving pieces from the carrier side?","Ben Moreland","Sure. Amir, this is Ben. Look, I think everything you just outlined is possible and longer beyond even that is the deployment of AWS-3 spectrum that was just auctioned. So -- and then, you mentioned FirstNet potentially and then the Dish spectrum. Having been at this for a long time like many of us here have, there are always ebbs and flows and sure, the leasing environment could improve in \u201816 or \u201917. I would caution you though that remember, we\u2019re adding about a $100 million of new revenue per year on the tower base today as Jay just mentioned. And so, if that were to increase by less just say, 30%, for example to take some of your upside, that's a 1% change in revenue growth or about 2% change in AFFO growth.","So, we work on that every day, that's what everybody listening to this call looks at Crown is focused on, but I want to caution you and it's one of the wonderful things about this business, the inflections up or down are relatively muted and as we mentioned, out of a 10% or 11% sort of total return profile, two-thirds of that\u2019s already on the books in the current dividend plus the contracted escalators. So, that last third, which is growth, absolutely focused on it, but maybe the up and down on that is a couple of percentage points on AFFO growth, which we\u2019d love to see, don't get me wrong, but that's one of the wonderful things about the business is it\u2019s not very movable to tell you the truth.","Amir Rozwadowski","That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up question here, obviously you folks have taken a differentiated view versus some of your peers on the international arena. We\u2019re starting to hear some I guess chatter about potential assets coming available in Europe, which is sort of a different investment profile than where we\u2019ve seen sort of international expansion take place with some of your peers before. I was wondering what your thoughts could be around if some of those assets became available, whether or not, they would be attractive and if that would sort of change a shift in focus for you as some of those assets became available?","Ben Moreland","Sure. It's certainly something we would look at. We use to operate in the UK in a very large way. The European market has developed in a much different way than North America, so we would want to make certain that the underwriting of those assets are appropriately took into account and what the collocation opportunity was going to be over time there. ","I would in a positive sense, we\u2019re marking our ability to finance locally there at a very attractive level, so to the extent, we have been looking at something there, we could certainly put an implicit hedge on the currency by financing locally. So there are a lot of attractive attributes to look into Western Europe, it would come down in my mind to what\u2019s the underwriting on the towers and what\u2019s the opportunity for revenue growth around the marketplace there and there are some dynamics in the Western European market that's made it a little more challenging to underwrite collocation growth and so we would want to make sure we would get that right, but I have absolutely no natural aversion to that, and think it's something that we could certainly look at.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Ben Moreland","You bet.","Operator","And we will go to Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael","Hi, great. Two questions if I may, first off, I was hoping you can give us a little bit of color on expectations for total CapEx for the remainder of the year, based off the 205 [ph] that you just did in the first quarter, a little bit higher than we had anticipated. And then also we've been hearing that you're seeing carriers increasingly looking to use CWAN architecture and their deployment is not just at the small cell DAS level, but also at the macro site. I was hoping if you could comment on whether or not you actually are seeing that? And if you are, how that's changing if it is at all, how carriers buy from you or what they buy from you? Thank you.","Jay Brown","Colby, on your first question around total CapEx, as we gave the guidance previously, I think we would expect to consume all of the excess cash flow if you were to take AFFO, subtract out the dividend that we're \u2013 our current policy suggests for the balance of the year, I think we will spend all of that on activities, the vast majority of which is likely to be directed towards small cells. ","As I answered one of the earlier questions about activity and interest in expanding it, given the returns that we're seeing in small cells, we would be willing to go beyond that cash flow amount and finance opportunities to the extent they exceeded the amount of cash flow that's produced, but I think as a starting point, what I would suggest is that you assume we utilize all of the excess cash flow beyond the dividend for investment in assets and that may ebb and flow a little bit quarter to quarter depending on how many projects we complete in any given quarter.","Ben Moreland","Colby, without taking everybody through technology lessons, I'm certainly not qualified to do on the call, I will make one comment about what we\u2019ve seen around the CWAN architecture and the possibilities there, and it\u2019s extremely early. Essentially what it may do for us is, it may remove some of the ground space requirements at towers and so to the extent you got a tower that may have a ground space challenge, i.e. not a very big footprint, by moving those base stations offsite into sort of a base station hotel and remotely powering that through fiber is something that we look at positively over time and potentially makes the upgrade cost of some of the smaller monopoles diminished and makes them more attractive over time. ","So it's extremely early, but I think the trend will be if we go down that path with that kind of architecture is that it's going to add value to some of the smaller sites, but potentially would have been challenging or expensive to add additional land and that may not be required now. That's about all I have on that so far.","Colby Synesael","Okay, great. I'll take it. Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi","Great. Thanks. Couple of follow-ups. First, on the CapEx spent on the existing sites I think it was $98 million, can you talk about how much capacity that creates? And how -- if you could help us gauge what the incremental boost to revenue growth it would provide over the longer term, and if that level shifts towards more small cells and sort of like a one quarter pickup?","And then if you could also provide some color on that $15 million increase in the organic growth, was that mostly coming from small cells and maybe the breakdown of activity in terms of amendments and new licenses? Thank you.","Jay Brown","Okay, sure. On your first question, when we spend CapEx on existing sites, that's always success based as we like to say around the place. The success base means that we don't spend any of the capital until there is a tenant ready to go on to that particular site. And so in terms of increasing the capacity of our existing sites, occasionally there is some natural increase to the capacity of the site than generally the site is made ready for the tenant who is standing there ready to go on it. ","The impact that we have to revenues as we know oftentimes is a part of that transaction we received, some upfront prepaid rents associated with the site, and so it does benefit longer term recurring revenues as we receive some of that rent upfront rather than amortized on -- rather than receiving it on a cash basis, month-to-month. ","On your second question around the increase in $15 million that we increased 2015 outlook for site rental revenue, virtually all of that is related to a small cell activity. It was very little that came from towers, the vast majority of it was small cell and achieved a good portion of that in the first quarter increasing our run rate for the balance of 2015.","The split of new licences and amendments, very similar to what we expected. We think full-year 2015 is pretty similar to what we saw in the quarter, is in the neighborhood of 60% to 65% new licences and the balance being amendments, that's what we saw approximately in 2014 and we expect a similar level in 2015.","Batya Levi","Great, thank you.","Operator","Next, we will go to Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.","Michael Bowen","Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions, most have been asked. But I'm curious about when you talk about -- I think you said it both ways on the call, so I'm hoping you can clarify this, I believe you said AFFO, but then also AFFO per share growth over the next five years in that 6% to 7% range.","So once we clear that up, under what scenarios could we possibly see rather than that staying steady. Given the spectrum allocation and more spectrum to come next year, more deployments obviously, it almost implies that you are predicting a headwind against some other growth given a backdrop of strong spectrum deployment and continued CapEx on the wireless side, so if you could talk to that, that would be helpful?","Ben Moreland","Okay, sure. Well, to clear up your first one, that\u2019s easy, yeah, we mean per share. So AFFO per share is all we work on around here, that's all that really matters. So certainly -- and so our statement of 6% to 7% AFFO per share growth is our five-year outlook on what we can deliver. ","And then to the headwind comment, actually it's maybe exactly the reverse, so let me walk you through as you can tell this year our guidance is about 5% AFFO growth and I would just point out that's carrying 800 basis points of non-renewals and about 100 basis points of FX headwind, so you can -- I'm actually kind of proud of that if you look at the core growth in the business that we are able to generate that 5% net. ","So the 5% net number this year, if we are making a five-year statement saying 6% to 7% over five years, we will then obviously, then it has to pick up in the second through the fifth year. ","And I think where Jay took the previous question is kind of where I would go, which is for planning purposes, we would suggest that we capture that additional growth to get back to that 6% to 7% over five years by the reduction in non-renewals as we've laid out in the supplement. This is the peak year for non-renewals and as that tails off, we pick up a couple of hundred basis points in the next year and probably more in the following year, just on the basis of the same level of leasing. ","And as I was answering the question earlier, we will absolutely work on capturing additional leasing opportunities if they are there, and there is a scenario where they are there. I think that each of the carriers in their own way of talking about adding self-identity and the requirements to do that, I think that's an inevitable outcome of the spectrum auctions and the demands being placed from the systems by mobile data as we talked about earlier. ","So I think it's inevitable that we're going to see continued leasing, I can't -- like we are seeing today, I can't today forecast for you if that's going to sort of \u2013 a bunch of favorable trends conspired to the point where we pick up maybe another 30% of leasing, which should be again 1% incremental revenue growth and about an incremental 200 basis points of AFFO line, that would be tremendous if that happens, but it would require that all four carriers sort of pull on their orders at the same time and that's not often the case in our industry. We have people doing various stages of their deployment cycle that's always been the case and so it \u2013 we don't plan on seeing an inflection point up, but there is a case that can be made that that's possible, certainly and if it's there, I can assure you will can capture it.","Michael Bowen","And then a quick follow-up actually, you mentioned four carriers now we possibly might have a fifth with the announcement from Google yesterday on Project Fi, can you give some thoughts, have you had discussions with Google, have you talked to them about this and how this may impact your business?","Ben Moreland","We have actually had a number of conversations with Google, I really won\u2019t go into the substance of those, but as you would expect, they\u2019re extremely well-versed in wireless and wireless networks. I think what we see in their announcement yesterday is a continuation of what we've seen for a long time and that is, there is a lot of outside companies with a vested interest in having access to wireless consumers. And so, that's always been the case, and Google being the latest one.","I look at it as a net positive and that it\u2019s going to drive to the extent they\u2019re successful, it's going to drive additional network capacity requirements into the Sprint and T-Mobile networks, which fundamentally and gives them a revenue stream to then reinvest in network capacity to accommodate that demand. And given the fact that and I don't say this lightly, given the fact where we sit, we are the most expeditious and cost-effective way to add network capacity unlike where we sit.","And so, we\u2019ll see how that develops over time, but as carriers deploy additional spectrum, as they add additional equipment and new cell sites, we as Crown and frankly the industry are the most effective cost-effective way for that to occur.","Michael Bowen","Okay. Thanks for taking those questions.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.","Spencer Kurn","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Given the new AMX tower spend in Mexico, I just wanted to know if you have any thoughts on how the Mexican market compares to other international markets you looked at, whether you're more comfortable with risk profile there? Thanks.","Ben Moreland","To be honest, we haven't looked at that carefully lately. It's true that in many emerging markets, the case for wireless growth is very clear. We can all understand how consumers who may not have had access to the wireless or certainly to the Internet, now offered an affordable alternative would be high users of wireless data and a shared infrastructure model in many of these markets makes perfect sense.","It all depends on our mind on -- we bring the wrong currency to any other market that we would enter by definition and so it's completely a function of initial, pricing the assets such that it reflects the risk undertaking -- we would be undertaking in terms of the currency movement and then, what the fundamental growth on the revenue per site opportunity is in terms of collocation to achieve an attractive total return on investment.","And thus far, in most of those markets, frankly in all of those markets, we haven't seen that price equation come back into sort of congruity for us, but others have different views and so to me it's not a question of the business model, it's purely a reflection on price and pricing in that mismatch of currency.","Spencer Kurn","Thanks. And just one more if I may on small cells. The revenue growth has been accelerating, pretty steadily for the last four or five quarters. Could you talk about you know do you have enough longevity to know to get sense for the organic contribution that you've been seeing?","Ben Moreland","I don't know how to parse that for you Spencer, there's a lot of nomenclature in that business that's not the same as towers and so, what I would say is, we have a significant amount of collocation going on, which you might say is, okay, well that's organic, I would agree with you, but every time you look at one of those, there is always typically an additional lateral or two or three that a new carrier would take that the old carrier didn't, and so that would not be organic, that would be new, if you will.","So, I don't want to take with you all this on the call, but it's a hybrid, it's always a hybrid between collocation and new. And if we look at our total growth in that business, it's a significant contribution from colos and then a significant contribution from new. That's about the tightest thing you might get.","Jay Brown","Spencer, I think one of the things just as you\u2019re modeling the business and thinking about that you find over time is that, in the tower cases, you are building towers, the input costs as well as monthly rents and the operating costs are relatively stable and have been for a long period of time, when we look at small cells, we\u2019re really, we\u2019re making a financial transaction where we\u2019re pricing the rent for the carrier, the various components of the relationship between the carrier that installs there against a very different proposition. The cost can vary per system, the number of nodes per fiber mile can vary per system, thus varying the amount of cost of fiber, some of it can be aerial, some of it can be buried, we can be in locations where it's very expensive to dig up a sidewalk for instance, in other places where the cost of laying fiber is not as high.","And so, because the costs are so variable, therefore the revenue and the margin in terms of nominal dollars vary. And so, as we think about the business and allocate capital, we're always looking at it on a yield and total return basis and those conversations and systems look very different than what they do historically when we build towers. So, where we have given most of our disclosure and as we've talked about the businesses that you've heard on past calls and again this morning, we focus on how is the yield on total investment doing and as we mentioned, the largest portion of the $1.7 billion that we've invested was an asset that we bought at about 4% yield and we\u2019ve taken the entire small cell contribution and returned on the investment that we\u2019ve made in small cells.","We've taken that entire $1.7 billion to a 7% yield today, which implies a significant amount of contribution on a -- I think as we could all call it organic basis. But as Ben mentioned, it's a blend, so it's not as clean, it\u2019s just looking at if you own [ph] the tower yesterday and today and what portion of the revenues or cash flows came on a same tower basis, it's not as clean. So we focus more on yields and looking at yields and looking at driving total yields up on the existing total base of capital. And maybe -- hopefully that's helpful color as you think about modeling the business.","Spencer Kurn","Very helpful. Thanks again.","Jay Brown","I think we have time for maybe one more question.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our last question from Ana Goshko with Bank of America.","Ana Goshko","Hi, thanks very much. I will try to make it quick. I just wanted to follow-up on the earlier comments, and there is a lot of focus on the benefits of getting to an investment grade rating and the companies intend to do that in the short term, but then when you talked about the potential completion of the Australian asset sale or unit stake, you said the intend would be to leave leverage neutral and I\u2019m wondering why isn\u2019t that an opportunity to reduce leverage and really be the catalyst to get the company over the goal line into the investor grade rating?","Jay Brown","Sure, Ana. I think when we say leverage neutral; we mean that on a ratio basis, not nominal dollars, so we would think about it as maintaining leverage neutral on a ratio basis. When we have looked at this and have done this over time for a long period of time, there is obviously one would call away or a path towards getting to five times that is not necessarily necessary.","So we think about this and have worked on this for a number of years of letting the growth in EBITDA naturally deleverage the business towards investment grade and we don't see any impetus or need frankly to accelerate that beyond what we would see in due course. So I think in all likelihood as Ben described, if we\u2019re ultimately successful in monetizing our Australia business unit, then you should expect us to maintain leverage ratio neutral and then invest the balance of the capital in either assets or the purchase of our own stock and we\u2019ll naturally grow towards getting to the investment grade credit ratios that we\u2019re aiming towards.","Ben Moreland","I mean it's a great question, I think the answer is we\u2019re going to get there soon enough either way and so we don\u2019t, we would use that capital for incremental growth in all likelihood.","Ana Goshko","Okay and then just as a quick follow-up, one of the issues with I think the overall rating is the company has taken advantage of the secured and securitized market, where you do get a low cost of capital, but that does put pressure on the rating. Where are you guys, I\u2019m thinking of moving towards more of a investment grade type capital structure where you really have less secured and it does lift the pressure that the agencies put on the overall corporate rating?","Ben Moreland","You\u2019re right and I think over time, as we get towards that investment grade credit rating and maybe even as we achieve it, you\u2019ll see us having more simplified capital structure today, we have several entities underneath our parent that have availed themselves to securitize debt and that's enabled us to achieve a very low cost of capital even though leverage maybe outside of what would be typical be an investment grade credit.","So, I think what you\u2019ll see over time is, we\u2019ll clean up some of the complexity in the capital structure, which will mean a lessening of our exposure to securitize debt and more of the debt move towards the holding company. But I don't think you should expect that all of it will go away, I think we\u2019ll continue to avail ourselves of that market, it gives us some diversity of sources of capital and even once we do achieve an investment grade credit rating, I think we\u2019ll still find that attracting some debt capital on a securitized basis with some portion of our assets makes good sense and helps to lower the overall cost of debt and capital.","Ana Goshko","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Son Nguyen","Very good. I think that wraps us up. Thank you for staying with us. I guess we went 70 minutes. Appreciate everybody's attention and we look forward to speaking with you on next quarter\u2019s call. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Son Nguyen. Please go ahead, sir.","Son Nguyen","Thank you, Devona, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our third quarter 2014 results. With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the risk factors section of the company's SEC filings. Our statements are made as of today, October 31, 2014, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","And in addition, today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Thanks, Son, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As we indicated in our earnings release last night, I am pleased to announce that we have meaningfully raised our annual dividend from $1.40 a share to $3.28 per share starting in December of this year.","I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing the reasons that led to this increased payout. First, we wanted to align the shareholder return with how the fundamentals of the business actually function. We expect the recurring cash flow that our business generates will largely be distributed going forward in the current dividend. Future dividends will benefit from the growth expected to come from a combination of contracted escalators, leasing on our existing portfolios and external acquisitions that exceed the initial cost of capital and increase the dividend over time. We expect that our AFFO organic growth rate over the next 5 years to be in the range of 6% to 7%, 1\/2 of which is currently contracted via escalators on our tenant lease contracts. In any given year, over 95% of our site rental revenues are typically under contract in the prior year, thus creating a certainty we enjoy around dividend capacity of the company.","Second, we believe this payout highlights and differentiates the $22 billion of high quality future revenues under long-term contract, primarily with the 4 major U.S. wireless carriers and our confidence in the sustainability of these cash flows as evidenced by this unprecedented commitment to returning capital to our shareholders.","Third, we have retained sufficient liquidity to achieve the embedded growth opportunities that are in front of us. As we've said on previous calls, the primary driver of incremental value for us at this point resides in the lease up potential of the portfolio we already own, most particularly, the new 17,000 towers and small cell business that we have added in recent years.","Further, this organic growth opportunity does not require a lot of capital to pursue. We have sized the dividend to retain 25% of AFFO, which we believe is necessary to pursue all of our organic growth plans and sustain the business appropriately. We will continue to seek external growth through further acquisition opportunities when such acquisitions cover the cost of the new capital and allow us to increase the dividend over time.","Fourth, we acknowledge that our organic growth rate in the future is likely to be lower than in the past, partly because of the law of large numbers and the headwinds associated with the carrier consolidation on nonrenewals we expect over the next 3 to 4 years. Thus, we believe a larger component of our shareholders' total return appropriately should come from the current distribution of our very high-quality contracted revenues, primarily serving the 4 national U.S. carriers and our industry-leading position on mission-critical wireless infrastructure.","Essentially, the way we think about our business is like a growing annuity of contracted, bond-like recurring cash flows and shareholders will be receiving a current distribution that can be considered interest on the bond, if you will, backed by the $22 billion of contracted revenues I mentioned we have on the books, plus growth from the embedded escalators in those contracts and increased utilization of our assets as carriers continue to invest in their networks to support the secular growth we are all familiar with in wireless broadband services. The quality of this cash flow is represented by nearly 90% of our revenues coming from the 4 largest U.S. carriers. For context, these carriers have a combined market capitalization of approximately $430 billion, and annualized operating cash flows of $70 billion and a composite average cost of borrowing of about 4.5%.","As a pastor entity of these cash flows supporting the mission-critical wireless infrastructure of the 4 largest U.S. carriers, we believe the composite bond yield of our tenants is an interesting benchmark for evaluating Crown Castle's total return prospects. Based on last night's closing share price, the combination of a dividend yield of approximately 4% and expected long-term organic growth in the 6% to 7% range delivers total returns of 10% to 11%. Of this expected total return, approximately 2\/3 is achieved via the current dividend and the contracted escalators under our tenant leases.","Fifth, it has long been my belief that an eventual high payout of the recurring cash flow from arguably what is one of the best business models, combined with expected growth in wireless, would yield a lower cost of capital over time. Further to this, we are maintaining a balance sheet profile that is consistent with our investment-grade ratings objectives.","As has been our long-standing practice, we have a very active ongoing dialogue about capital allocation and how we maximize long-term value for Crown Castle's shareholders. Recently, we spoke with and received feedback from many shareholders and several investment banks. Opinions among shareholders and the investment banks were split between support for distributing a high percentage of our AFFO in the form of dividends and desire for us to maintain a lower payout and continue to retain more flexibility to purchase shares opportunistically. We believe both camps have reasoned and thoughtful positions, and we spent a considerable amount of time and analysis among ourselves and with our Board considering the appropriate approach for our business.","As managers of the business, we find the perspectives of our owners on matters such as capital allocation incredibly advantageous. We don't believe we have a monopoly on good ideas, and therefore, we welcome the conversation. For those of our shareholders who would've preferred that we not raise the dividend so significantly in the short term, we appreciate the effort and feedback that you provided and would hope that you would consider the rationale that we have articulated and why we believe that a greatly increased payout is the best approach.","Turning to our results. I want to reflect for a moment on the year we're having as we head for the finish of 2014. We have increased our 2014 outlook for AFFO to $4.20 a share, representing 14% growth compared to 2013. This growth has been achieved roughly from equal contributions from growth in our network services business and our growth in organic site rental margins.","I am very pleased with our results. They've been accomplished even in the face of the initial headwind from the impact of the Sprint decommissioning of its iDEN network that impacted 200 basis points of AFFO growth in 2014. We have provided 2015 outlook today that includes AFFO per share growth of 4% for the full year. As previously disclosed, impacting our growth outlook is approximately $65 million of nonrenewals from the final year of the Sprint iDEN decommissioning, as well as approximately $40 million from network rationalization of Metro PCS, Leap and Clearwire legacy networks. Clearly, this is a meaningful headwind, but we were pleased to be able to forecast continued gross leasing activity that is driving double-digit organic growth before the impact of these network rationalizations.","Unfortunately, based on our most recent conversations with T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T, we expect that the rationalization of Metro PCS, Clearwire and Leap networks will continue to be a headwind to our organic growth beyond 2015. Thus, with this AFFO headwind beyond 2015, we would expect it to impact our long-term outlook, resulting in organic growth expectations of 6% to 7% annually over the next 5 years. We will keep you updated quarterly as we receive more details on the network rationalization plans.","Our growth expectations are driven by long-term industry fundamentals, and 2014 is proving to be a year of continued healthy gross leasing activity. Looking ahead to 2015, we expect leasing activity from new tenant installations and amendments to existing leases to remain robust and similar to our expectations for 2014, as all 4 major wireless carriers continue to upgrade their networks to meet consumer demand. Towards that end, we have deliberately focused our energy and capital in the U.S. as we believe the U.S. market offers the most compelling risk-adjusted returns where carriers have the most apparent economic incentive to invest in the world.","As you can see on Slide 6, the U.S. market is uniquely attractive due to its relative size and robustness compared to other markets. Further, U.S. carriers are able to generate incremental returns on their capital investment on a scale significantly larger than other geographies. This can be seen by the approximately $600 in average annual revenues per subscribers that carriers earned, compared to approximately $100 in annual investment per subscriber. This relatively high ARPU is supported by the staggering growth in mobile data consumption by U.S. subscribers. As confirmation of the need to continue to invest in order to improve network quality and increase capacity and add functionality, U.S. carriers are projected to invest billions of dollars in the upcoming AWS and broadcast spectrum auctions.","These spectrum auctions, in addition to spectrum that currently resides with wireless carriers that has not yet been deployed, require wireless infrastructure to be deployed and, thus, provide a long runway of future demand. Recent comments from wireless carriers, who seek to continue to differentiate themselves based on network quality, reinforce our belief in the long-term growth prospects of our business. The reality is that there are really no limits to the opportunity wireless broadband holds for how we live our lives and benefit from connectivity never before imagined.","In the 1999 and 2000 era, we purchased our initial portfolio of sites from carriers on an unproven co-location thesis with an initial yield of around 4%. As you can see on Slide 7, today those sites have a yield of over 15%. Today, we are fielding familiar questions about the near-term results of our 2 large carrier tower acquisitions in 2013 and 2014 from T-Mobile and AT&T, which have initial yields of around 5% on these 17,000 towers. It's early, but we are very pleased with the early results that we've seen. We are experiencing lease-up that we expected, and are driving yields on these portfolios up as we had anticipated. Jay will take you through some additional details on the growth of our recent acquisitions, which are tracking with our underwriting models at the time of acquisition.","As the U.S. market leader, with nearly 40,000 towers and a very active and growing small cell opportunity, currently at 14,000 nodes, we are well positioned to benefit from these growing macro trends. We believe the long-term prospects of the business have never been stronger, with 4 national U.S. carriers actively investing for growth in their business. We have a long track record of creating value for shareholders, and with the high-quality assets that we have assembled, we believe we are poised to continue this record.","We maintain a long-term focus on the decisions we make and welcome the opportunity to differentiate our company with our significant commitment to return capital to shareholders, while retaining all growth opportunities that are inherent in our long-term business plan and providing share wireless infrastructure to the wireless industry. And with that, I'd be pleased to turn the call over to Jay for some more comments.","Jay A. Brown","Thanks, Ben, good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial results, we had a terrific third quarter, exceeding the high end of our previously issued outlook for site rental revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. The robust leasing activity continued during the quarter, and we look forward to closing out the year strong. The results achieved during the third quarter allow us to once again increase our outlook for full year 2014.","Turning to Slide 8. In the third quarter, site rental revenue grew 21% year-over-year from $621 million to $752 million. Organic site rental revenue grew approximately 7% compared to the same period in 2013.","The approximately 7% organic site rental revenue growth is comprised of approximately 4% growth from cash escalation in our tenant lease contracts, approximately 6% growth from new leasing activity, net of approximately 3% from nonrenewals.","On Slide 9, I want to spend a minute to break down the composition of year-over-year growth and organic site rental revenue, and the leasing activity among our various asset portfolios we have owned for at least 1 year. Our legacy U.S. assets, excluding the T-Mobile and AT&T portfolios, generated year-over-year organic site rental revenue growth of approximately 5%, inclusive of the nonrenewal headwinds. The 5% on our legacy assets compares to approximately 7% for the T-Mobile portfolio. Given the lower tenancy, a significant portion of this growth is driven by new tenant installations. We completed the integration of the T-Mobile assets about a year ago, and the assets continue to perform in line with our underwriting acquisition model. We've substantially completed the integration of the AT&T assets during this past quarter, and we are encouraged by the leasing activity we are seeing on that portfolio. The AT&T portfolio's performance is comparable to the T-Mobile assets at this stage, and is consistent with our underwriting acquisition model, which assumes one tenant added over 10 years similar to our assumption on the T-Mobile assets. While it is still early days on both the T-Mobile and the AT&T assets, we are confident in our thesis that we can create value by leasing these assets over time.","On the small cell front, we continue to see strong adoption and growth. Site rental revenue growth from our small cell networks is up approximately 30% year-over-year, contributing approximately 7% to consolidated site rental revenues. At the end of the third quarter, we had over 6,000 miles of fiber, serving over 14,000 small cell nodes on air under construction, with 21,000 tenants residing on these nodes. Currently, we have over 3 tenant leases per mile of fiber we own or approximately 1.5 tenants per node. In total, these nodes are generating approximately a 7% yield on the total invested capital we have deployed to build or acquire fiber for our small cell networks.","The vast majority of the current small cell activity is being driven by Verizon. However, we believe the other carriers will follow over time, adding small cell nodes across our fiber assets, driving our expectations for returns on the investments we're making. We continue to make investments in fiber to deploy small cell because we believe the investment will deliver attractive returns and increase our long-term dividend capacity.","On a unit economic basis, we are generally seeing initial yields from the fiber we deploy for small cells of approximately 6% to 8% on the -- with the anchor tenant. Similar to towers, we see yields on our fiber assets being driven up into the low to mid-teens from additional lease-up and amendment.","Returning to Q3 financial results on Slide 10, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter increased 21% from the same quarter in 2013. This growth is attributable to the increase in site rental gross margin inclusive of the AT&T towers and strong performance from network services. AFFO for the third quarter was $350 million compared to $271 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of 29%. On a per share basis, AFFO was up 13%, increasing from $0.93 per share to $1.05 per share.","Turning to investments and financing activities as shown on Slide 11. During the third quarter, we invested $204 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $17 million on our land purchase program. We are on pace to complete nearly 2,200 land transactions during 2014, of which approximately 25% are purchases but the remainder being lease extensions. Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business, as we look to control our largest operating expense and produce stable and growing cash flow over time.","Having completed more than 16,000 land transactions, we believe we have the most secure portfolio of ground interest in the industry. Today, approximately 1\/3 of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own, and approximately 70% on land we own or lease for more than 20 years.","Where we have ground leases, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years. We have provided more detailed information regarding the ground interest beneath our towers in our quarterly supplement. Of the remaining capital expenditures, we invested $167 million in revenue generating capital expenditures, consisting of $99 million on existing sites and $68 million on the construction of new sites, primarily small cell construction activity. We also spent approximately $20 million on sustaining CapEx, which was below our third quarter 2014 outlook. However, we've not adjusted our full year outlook for sustaining capital expenditures as we expect to perform the same sustaining CapEx activities within '14, completing this work during the fourth quarter of this year.","During the quarter, we also invested approximately $90 million in acquisitions primarily related to the acquisitions of ground interest underneath towers. Further, during the quarter, we paid a quarterly stock dividend of $0.35 per share or $117 million in aggregate. As of September 30, our total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA is 5.3x. Our weighted average cost of debt stands at 4.2% with a weighted average maturity of 6 years. As Ben mentioned, our decision to increase the dividend has further reinforced our views regarding maintaining appropriate leverage on the balance sheet. We remain committed to staying on a path to an investment-grade credit rating and maintaining a target level of leverage of -- range of 4x to 6x.","Moving on to the 2014 outlook on Slide 12. We have increased full year 2014 outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. The increase in the outlook is primarily driven by third quarter results, an extension of the tenant leases with one of our major wireless carrier customers in Australia during the fourth quarter and expected higher network services gross margin contribution offset by a decrease in the assumed exchange rate from our previous outlook.","For 2015, as shown on Slide 13, we expect new leasing activity to be similar to 2014, offset by an elevated level of tenant nonrenewals. Moving from left to right on the slide, at the midpoint of our outlook, new leasing activity or incremental revenue from new tenant installations and amendments to existing leases is expected to be approximately $145 million during 2015 as compared to $125 million for 2014. Of the approximately $145 million in new leasing activity, expected contributions from tower leasing and small cell leasing are $100 million and $45 million, respectively. The approximately $100 million in new leasing contribution from tower leasing represents over 4,000 lease equivalents on over 40,000 towers or approximately 0.1 tenants per tower. As we've stated on numerous occasions, our long-term view of this is that we can add approximately one tenant per tower over the next 10 years, and we're right on track.","This 2015 growth is offset by the expected headwind from nonrenewals. Nonrenewals for 2015 are expected to be between $110 million and $120 million. Of this $110 million to $120 million, we expect approximately $60 million to $70 million to come from Sprint's decommissioning of its iDEN network, as previously announced. In addition, we would've expected 1% to 2% impact to site rental revenues from normal nonrenewals or approximately $45 million at the midpoint. For 2015, we expect the normal nonrenewal bucket to be largely consumed by the beginning of the carrier consolidation nonrenewals, as Ben mentioned.","Beyond 2015, we expect potential nonrenewals from the decommissioning of a portion of the Leap, Metro PCS and Clearwire networks to be approximately $160 million of current run rate site rental revenues. Based on our current understanding and the communication we've received from our customers, we expect the impact from these nonrenewals related to these 3 networks in 2016 to be between approximately $60 million and $70 million and approximately $100 million in 2017 and beyond. Our expectations for the potential impact from nonrenewals represent approximately 60% of the site rental revenues generated by Leap, Metro PCS and Clearwire. We do not expect any of the nonrenewals to come from our small cell networks. We have provided additional details in our quarterly supplement.","Continuing with organic site rental revenue growth, escalations on the existing tenant lease contracts is expected to be approximately $90 million in 2015. New leasing, escalations and nonrenewals combine to arrive at organic site rental revenue growth of approximately 4% or $120 million. The $120 million in organic site rental revenue growth for 2015 translates to approximately $55 million in expected GAAP site rental revenue growth, after making $65 million in adjustments for straight line accounting and exchange rates and other items. The adjustment for straight line accounting removes the benefit of approximately $90 million in contracted escalators on the existing tenant leases, and adds approximately $30 million in straight line revenues related to the new leasing activity, including the tenant lease renewals that I mentioned before.","Moving to Slide 14. Our 2015 outlook for site rental gross margins and adjusted EBITDA assumes an increase of approximately 6% or $60 million in cost of operations in general and administrative costs as compared to 2014. All of the increase in expenses is reflected in the run rate expenses for Q3 2014, after accounting for the typical 3% annual increase, as we have increased staffing during 2014 to accommodate an increase in small cell activity, growth in network services and the expansion in the size of the asset portfolio.","Given the strong level of leasing activity and the agreements we have in place with our tenants, we see continued strength in our network services business, and expect it to replicate the operating performance of 2014. We expect 2015 AFFO to increase to 100 -- $1.45 billion. Of this $1.45 billion in AFFO, we expect to distribute approximately $1.1 billion in dividends and use the remaining portion to fund the activities that drive our organic growth.","Let me summarize the year-over-year changes as it relates to AFFO. As shown on Slide 15, beginning with the net leasing of approximately $30 million after nonrenewals, plus the $90 million benefit from tenant escalations, offset by the cost increases of approximately $60 million and other adjustments of approximately $10 million, results in our year-over-year growth in AFFO of $50 million. This simple layout is a good model for AFFO growth for future years beyond 2015 for our business. As you consider 2016, for instance, based on the information we have provided for nonrenewals and assuming leasing activity remains at current levels, we would expect AFFO growth in 2016 to be approximately 6% or 200 basis points higher than that of '15. As Ben mentioned, over the next 5 years, we target AFFO growth to be 6% to 7% organically.","To complete the picture, this underlying growth in our existing assets frames our expectation for future dividends per share, as we expect to increase the dividend commensurate with AFFO per share growth over time. With respect to our dividend policy, we believe the acceleration to a higher payout today appropriately balances providing shareholders with increased certainty for a significant portion of shareholder returns, without compromising our ability to deliver long-term organic growth.","Since the early days of Crown Castle, our long-term capital allocation goal was to distribute a meaningful portion of our cash flows to shareholders in the form of dividends, and we are pleased to realize that goal today. With that, operator, be happy to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.","Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research","I understand some of the pressures on 2015 insurance and site revenue growth, but I wanted to focus on the 6% 7% long-term growth and your comments on 6% AFFO growth in 2016. You talked about the AT&T lease-ups beginning to kick in, in small cells, I guess when you add up all of that, I'm a little surprised that you're not thinking about new business picking up in 2016 and AFFO growth accelerating next year. So I wanted to know if you just walk through the puts and takes of that. Specifically, your organic growth at 4%, not picking up, and I think that the dividend growth component is a big determinant of where the yield should be, and obviously if there's a big difference between 6% and, say, 9% or 10% in a good year. So just walk us through the puts and takes of '16 and beyond on sort of, what -- you've talked about the churn, I want to talk about the organic growth opportunities in some of the lease-up on the MLAs picks up, and you have some capacity.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure Kevin, this is Ben. I'll start and Jay may jump in here in a minute. As we think about 2016, Jay mentioned we could likely see a couple hundred basis points or so of improvement. I'd break that down for you. First, on the expense line, we certainly wouldn't expect to increase expenses again, scaling as we have done in 2014. So as that returns to a more normal, sort of 3% growth rate, even allowing for new systems coming on board on the small cell side, I would think we'd pick up probably 100 to 150 basis points there of improvement to AFFO. And then similarly, as we've given guidance on churn, our best estimate for 2016 at this point would be that we would see maybe 100 basis points or so less impact in 2016. So that's the nature of the 200 or so basis points of pickup in '16 over '15, pro forma. As you think longer term, it goes to really -- to revenue, and I want to talk about this real clearly for everyone. Today, at the current levels and our forecast for 2015, we're adding about $100 million of new revenue from new leasing on the tower portfolio that we have today, and as Jay indicated in his comments, that's equivalent to about 1\/10 of 1 tenant on all 40,000 towers that we currently own. We're quite comfortable with that. That was sort of our underwriting model, and I might add, that's even continuing on some of the legacy -- many of the legacy towers we've had that are over 90,000 in revenue today per tower. So the new assets are punching above their weight on a percentage growth basis because they're coming off of a smaller base, but they are a smaller base, and it's a smaller contributor to our overall revenue than the enormous base we have on the legacy portfolio today. So in the vicinity of $100 million or so, and even if that were to increase by, let's just say, 10%, just to make up a number for you, that's $10 million, and that's not even 1% growth on AFFO. So the numbers, and as I mentioned in my comment, not -- didn't take them lightly, the law of large numbers here is definitely in play. And so while the churn and the nonrenewals we've talked about is a short- to medium-term obstacle that we will get over. The law of large numbers, where we're adding, call it, $100 million to $150 million of AFFO a year going forward on a similar asset base, obviously, that's a diminishing growth rate every year, and that's something to be appreciated and went into our thinking around how we structured the dividend and how we think about the long-term growth expectations. Now clearly -- add 2 other points to that. As the churn continues to lessen in outer years, as we roll through this consolidation churn, you would expect, then, to have more contribution to AFFO growth, even on this $100 million or so on the tower side and maybe $40 million to $50 million on the small cell side. And I would mention again, we're getting very attractive initial yield from that investment in the small cells, and significant co-location occurring across those nodes today, as Jay mentioned. So if you just assume that continues, that's how you get to sort of the 6% to 7% over 5 years. You certainly can appreciate, if you start off at 4% and the second year might be 6%, and we're suggesting to everybody that over 5 years it's sort of 6% to 7%, obviously, the back half of those years has to be better, and that's our expectation. But I do think it's important to ground everybody in the -- in sort of the law of large numbers around the organic growth opportunity or capability of the business. It shouldn't be lost on anyone that the guidance we've given today of 4% AFFO growth, which is inclusive of this outsized investment we've made in resources to accommodate the opportunity we see, about 100 basis points of headwind there, also has 700 basis points of churn in it. So the organic engine, if you will, is in the vicinity of 11% or so, and we're very, very pleased with that, but that's subject to this law of large numbers diminishment over time. Finally, last point. No one should leave this call with any diminished view about our goal to continue to add assets through external acquisitions where it can cover the initial cost of capital, obviously, a dividend and interest expense to the extent it requires equity capital and new debt, and then would be accretive to our ability to grow the dividend over time. It'll be a very simple formula from this day forward, because it's going to be very easy to figure out what the dividend component is, and what the interest component is. And anything we would pursue certainly would need to be -- would need to cover its initial cost of capital and be accretive to that growth rate over time, or it would make no sense to do it. So we believe that there will be opportunities to continue to grow the business and compound the growth against that new capital, but for purposes of discussion on our 5-year plan, as always, we don't forecast those acquisitions until they're on the table, and that's the guidance we've given you today.","Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research","Just a quick follow-up on the churn. Is this -- your -- so on the acquired company churn in the out years, have you gotten a request already from the carriers to -- for this plan? Or is this sort of your, kind of worst-case scenario exposure, aggregate exposure for those acquired companies?","W. Benjamin Moreland","No, Kevin. This is based on very real-time significant conversations we've had with all 3 of those parent companies around their decommissioning plans over time and as it would impact our business. I think in the disclosure, we indicated that about $260 million of revenue resides on our tower sites today, another 90 or so on the small cells. Small cells are unaffected. So it's upwards of close to 80% of our revenue on the tower side that we expect to be rationalized over time, and that's coming directly from conversations we've had, more than one, with ongoing conversations we've had over this last quarter and subsequent to the quarter where we feel like, in good faith, we had an obligation to sort of bring those forward and -- as real-time information and put that in our forward outlook. That could change. Sometimes it does change, but these are serious conversations, and the carriers have actually spoken publicly on numerous occasions about their opportunity to realize synergies around these networks, and you're seeing that here reflected in these numbers.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess I have related questions. The first one is, Ben, you set out a kind of 5-year game plan here, it seems based on a series of kind of conversations that seem to be somewhat casual, that have happened over maybe the last several weeks or a couple of months. And it feels like this is a pretty significant reduction in the expectations for the future for a very long time, based on a few conversations. I guess the real question is, do you see downside to what you're presenting here? Or are you presenting a pretty downside case? And as the world evolves, as the world of wireless does, there could conceivably be upside here? And then the second question is -- you mentioned, obviously, we're all wondering about the Verizon deal. We were expecting that they're, if you were to come to terms with Verizon, there would have to be an equity component. With your stock down, and now the dividend cost of your stock being higher, is the hurdle rate to do a deal, any deal, now greater if the stock were to stay where it is right now? Or in your own mind, has your cost of capital not changed and you look at deals now the same way you would've looked at them yesterday?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure. On the nonrenewal discussion, Dave, we don't take this casually. This is a material fact that we felt compelled to share with all of our shareholders, and we realize it is a material change in our long-term, sort of growth outlook, and it was for us too, as shareholders, I can assure you. We don't take it lightly, and these are based on -- more than conversations, these are based on significant, sort of indicated plans and planning that they have shared with us, including site-specific information, and that's the nature of the conversations we've had, and the seriousness with which we take it. I don't think it could be much worse than this, candidly, and it could be better, certainly, it could be, as carrier rationalization plans develop over time. But the point I would make on the \"it could be better.\" I would caution everybody on that, because I would remind you that we continue to maintain a robust gross leasing outlook. So we are continuing to expect that we'll add upwards of $100 million or so across the tower footprint every year, which is a robust leasing environment that would encompass, certainly, these 3 parent companies continuing to invest aggressively in their networks going forward, post rationalization, or while they're rationalizing the legacy acquired networks. So I'd say the -- on the -- the ad [ph] side of that, on the gross side, we've got a very robust expectation for leasing that we're going to work very hard to accommodate and accomplish. On the Verizon tower transaction prospectively, I don't have anything specific to announce about that. Obviously, Verizon would speak for themselves about their desire to divest their towers, should that occur. As we would think about a need to raise equity going forward on an acquisition in general, we would, as I mentioned in my notes, we would look at any opportunity out there and view it as, certainly the need to cover its initial dividend and interest expense, and then certainly, have a very significant and disciplined expectation, that it adds to our ability to grow the dividend over time, or there's really no reason to pursue it, because we understand that the valuation of the firm going forward will be very much around the current dividend yield that the market will shake out and the expectation for future growth. We've given you a view today that the organic ability of the company is in the vicinity of 6% to 7% over the next 5 years. I would be quick to add that about 1\/2 of that growth is already on the books today, in the form of the contracted escalators we have across our company today. So approximately 2\/3 of the total return profile that we're suggesting to people is available on the existing asset portfolio today that we own. Approximately 2\/3 of that total return profile is already on the books, and I think that's pretty compelling. And we have every opportunity to continue our legacy of growing assets and creating additional value, and we'll continue to pursue it that way.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I could just ask one quick follow-up, which is, when you talk about the incremental $100 million of leasing revenue growth, you gave us kind of a -- that's kind of a macro picture. Is the -- can you talk about the small cell site outlet that you're baking into this 6% to 7% growth rate?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure. That would suggest a continued level of growth in and about the $140 million to $150 million total, so an incremental $40 million to $50 million on the small cell side as well. That's a mixture of co-locations on existing systems, as well as investment at about this current level that we're seeing today with the retained AFFO, as Jay mentioned in his discussion, around our logic on what we are, in fact, retaining, where we're able to continue to invest in the small cell side, which are coming at attractive initial yields and provide great promise around total returns from co-location over time. So that suggests that, that would stay at about the current level.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","One easy question, I think, and on to the harder question. Give you the easy one first. The -- with the dividend thought process, how did the NOLs fit into it? What happens to the value? Did you see value in the NOLs and what happens to it? That's the easy one.","W. Benjamin Moreland","The NOLs continue to have value for the company, and there's -- the remaining to be, I think maybe just shy of $2 billion by the end of this year, Jay, is that kind of where we think? We're burning them now, obviously, with the federal income tax net income, so just shy of $2 billion. When you work out, Ric, that math over the next sort of 5 years, it's not a huge driver of value for the firm, but it is interesting optionality that we will retain now, by not essentially consuming very much of those NOLs going forward. And so we will continue to have that. It provides some flexibility for us on potentially an asset sale one day, where we would shelter a gain, but it's not a significant driver to the overall value of the stock, and it was one that we were willing to sort of move to the back burner in terms of order of priority, based on what we thought was the appropriate need or desire to have shareholders participate in this recurring and growing cash flow stream as we've outlined.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Makes sense. We'd always held that on our model as like, if you ever sold Australia, that might be a nice asset to have around the NOLs.","W. Benjamin Moreland","It will be in our pocket.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The more difficult question is I understand the law of large numbers, I would say, you guys have done a lot of portfolio additions, but little bit back to the earlier question, if you think about when you bought the AT&T towers and the T-Mobile towers, ballpark 1.6, 1.7 tenants per tower, versus much higher tenancy at your base portfolio or your legacy portfolio. Remember here in the past that buying those carrier towers was like a big bet on co-location densification. We've seen a lot of amendment activity, heavy amendment activity lately versus co-lo. Is this update to your guidance a way of saying also that, that maybe the new co-los don't happen, or it takes a much longer period of time. So just trying to reconcile the big bet on carrier portfolios of low tenancy, betting on densification hitting co-location, and then this new kind of view. What are your thoughts on that?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I haven't changed my view, and that's a great question. We have, as we mentioned when we acquired those portfolios, we had underwritten approximately 1 additional tenant per tower over 10 years, and we're tracking at that level. But you're right to point out that, that's based, because there's not a lot of existing tenancy, a lot of that has to be based on future co-location. We expect that'll happen. In fact, we think there's a very strong thesis in the -- that we should have ultimately based on network demands, have essentially every -- all 4 tenants on every one of our sites over time. We don't underwrite it that way. We don't put that in our guidance. That's not in the 6% to 7%, but if you think about the legacy portfolio, how do you get to $95,000 of revenue per tower on the legacy sites after 12 to 14 years of marketing them? You get there by continuing to add tenancy and subsequent amendment activity over time, well beyond maybe your initial underwriting. That sort of falls in the category of the upside will take care of itself, and so we don't put that into the model or into the discussion very often, but we don't have any diminished view of that lease-up over time. Jay, did you want to...","Jay A. Brown","Ric, you can see in the numbers when I was talking, in my comments about how the T-Mobile portfolio and, the follow on to that is AT&T, how they've performed, adding about 0.1 tenants is right about 7%, which is right where the portfolio is performing. So as you get into the law of large numbers, obviously, on a percentage basis, that'll come down, but it's tracking right in line with what we expected. And on the T-Mobile and AT&T assets, we continue to believe that co-locations are going to be the biggest driver of that revenue growth. I think for the quarter, we were in the ballpark of about 65% of our leasing activity, were co-locations from new leases and about 35% were from amendments to existing leases.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But if we were to see a significant shift in the carriers, being -- from amendment spending of their CapEx being new co-location, that could lead to the upside of your numbers back to the sent, [ph] the previous questions?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, it could, and right now -- as we've said on prior calls, the most active co-locator in the industry today, by a large margin is Verizon, and I think that's been well documented. Other carriers, the other 3, are very aggressively still building LTE capacity into their network, as well as beginning to show signs of hope, happily from our perspective, of adding new sites. We're seeing that occur in all 3 of the carriers, where they're coming back and looking at capacity infill sites, which would be new co-locations and they talked about it in public settings recently. Verizon for 2014 is the most active, but we would expect over time the other 3 to return to co-location in a very aggressive way as they're adding capacity density in these networks, which are required over time as they continue to add data services.","Jay A. Brown","Ric, I think one other way to speak about the portfolio, and certainly it went into our thinking as we looked at the T-Mobile and the AT&T assets, was the diversity that we thought it brought to the company in addition to the growth. So the legacy assets, 24,000 assets, obviously those are heavily, more heavily weighted towards amendments to existing leases. The new assets that we bought are more heavily weighted towards a belief around co-locations of new tenants. So our experiences have been, over a long period of time, that there are ebbs and flows, where carriers allocate capital towards one activity or another, whether it's new leases or amendments, and we feel great about the portfolio that we have. And as we talk about our longer-term forecast, we might see that move one way or another, and maybe that means for some period of time, either the legacy portfolios, or the more recently acquired portfolios benefit from the whatever stage in the cycle the carriers are in, but we like the diversity that we have in the mix, so that we think we'll do well in both cycles.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to go back to the discussion around establishing what the payout was going to be. How did you get comfortable that 75% was the right starting point? And then as you think about going forward, what do you have to believe to believe that you could pay out a higher portion of your cash? And then lastly, based on the redistribution requirements, will you reach a point where you have to?","W. Benjamin Moreland","You want to start with that, Jay, and I'll pick up the second part?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, the second part of that of where would we reach from an NOL standpoint, we have long believed that where we would end up is somewhere between 70% and 80%. So basically, our starting point is paying out effectively all of the taxable income. I don't believe, from an NOL standpoint, we're going to get ourselves in a place where the dividend payout would be driven based on a need to pay out a higher percentage. I think it's more likely that Ben probably wants -- may speak more to the rationality laid out in his prepared remarks. But, it's more likely we have a strategic conversation about that, rather than being driven by taxable income","W. Benjamin Moreland","In terms of the -- where we establish the payout, Brett, we really started with the notion of, what do we need to retain to accomplish the organic growth expectations that we have on the existing assets that we currently own, and that includes the current level of spend on the very productive investment we're making in small cells. So we really started with that as an opening premise, and we didn't put ourselves in a lot of risk on requiring us to raise outside capital to accomplish those growth expectations on an organic basis. I think that's a very prudent and thoughtful approach, and the rest, 75%, will now be in the current dividend. Going forward, there's a couple of things that we can think about in the future that could impact or make us reevaluate that payout, and this is pure speculation, because we're just starting out. But as we achieve an investment grade rating, and by definition, you would have more access to capital through good markets and bad, at even less cost than we're currently paying, I think that would heighten our confidence level in reliance on the capital markets to fund some of these activities. So over time, we could consider and evaluate whether or not it made sense to raise the payout. No commitment here on my part, but that's something that would be reasonable to assume that we could evaluate, once we have more -- once we have more certainty around access to capital. We were certainly not willing to put ourselves in a position where we thought we were risking the growth opportunity, accomplishing the growth opportunity in the company by needing to access outside capital to make the assets perform. I think that would be irresponsible on our part here, Day 1. Over time, as the market becomes -- as the shareholder base becomes, I think, more accustomed and more used to underwriting the sustainability of the dividend in this wonderful business we're in, I think that will -- it'll be something that we'll continue to evaluate along with the investment-grade rating.","Operator","And we'll go to Colby Synesael with Cowan and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great, two questions, if I may. First off, just as it relates to the timing of the terminations, I'm just curious if the Metro PCS, the Leaps, and Clearwire, if this is happening early, in other words, if they're going to be paying you some form of payment to end the contracts earlier than they otherwise would, similar to what we're seeing with iDEN, where I think they're paying you, call it, $12,000 a tower to do so, or if they're actually waiting for their contracts to expire and that's why we're seeing it roll off, I guess, over the next 4 years. And then my second question had to do with just your guidance specific to 2015. When I look at new leasing activity in escalators specifically, in both situations, for 2015 when compared to what your guidance currently is for 2014, you're assuming slower growth, and I'm just trying to understand what might be the reason for that.","Jay A. Brown","That last statement, real quick, it's more growth.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, well, just specifically, you're looking for 5.1% new leasing activity versus 5.5% in 2014, and for escalators, you're assuming escalators are 3.3% versus this year, 3.6%.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Colby, on the second question, I would point you to Slide 13 of the presentation that we showed. We're showing that -- on a new leasing activity basis, we're assuming, in 2014, approximately $125 million of new leasing activity, and for 2015, we're assuming $145 million. So there's an actual pickup there of 15 to -- about 15% or so higher leasing activity in '15 than there is in 2014. That, obviously, on a percentage basis though, off of a larger base, is going to be a lower percentage. So if you're looking at percentages, it's going to be lower. On the escalator provision, the primary driver for that is in the legacy portfolio, as you're aware, we signed a number of MLAs that had higher escalation provision. It's how we accounted for the opportunity for these tenants to make additional amendments on the sites, and so the escalators on those would be higher than the 2 acquired portfolios. And as we roll in the AT&T portfolio into the organic year-over-year comparison, that escalator on a percentage basis, is going to come down by just a touch there. So that's the primary thing there, but I think on an activity basis, we're expecting slightly, slightly more. On the first question around the timing of terminations, we're not embedding into this, into our guidance, any expectation that the tenants are going to be paying us early termination fees. We're assuming that they live by the contractual obligations that they have, and that the terms of the agreement hold up. If, as we go along, you've heard us talk about the pay and walk fees that we had associated with Sprint as they were decommissioning their iDEN networks, there may be some of that over time. They'll have an obligation, either to make the site back to the condition that it was prior to the equipment was installed, or we would be happy to perform that service for them. We're not forecasting that in our outlook, but that would end up running through our services business, and not through site rental revenues. We typically think of that as one-time work, and put that in site rental revenue -- and put that in services instead of in site rental revenue, so. But we haven't embedded any of that in our forecast, over time.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So right now, the turndown of the sites is actually aligned with when the contracts [indiscernible] .","Jay A. Brown","Based on their contractual rights, that's how we've done it. So they're -- it's their -- let me just roll the clock back, and make sure I give you a wholesome answer and one way to think about this. When Sprint was looking at decommissioning their iDEN network years ago, they ended up coming back and doing short-term lease extensions on some of their sites in order to -- because they weren't quite ready to decommission sites at a particular date and time. What we have provided for you is what we believe, based on what those 3 carriers have told us about when they're going to decommission sites and the amounts of those, we provided that information to you. That's our expectation of the $200 million. That aligns with their contractual rights under the tenant leases that they have with us. If they were to come back and extend that timeline or facts change, then I think we would be open to having a conversation, and we'll update you as those conversations proceed, but what we've given you is a combination of their contractual rights and obligations against what they've told us about the decommissioning of the site.","Operator","And we'll go next with Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This goes a little bit to a question a couple ago, but can you help us think about the potential for CapEx and an expansion in 2015 under the 75% payout ratio? On our math, and admittedly, it's a little preliminary, but it looks like you'd have to take CapEx down somewhat year-over-year, or go out and borrow money, which you said you don't want to put yourself in a position to. Does it seem like there are fewer opportunities? Or am I just totally off-base?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, go ahead, Jay.","Jay A. Brown","So we sized it, as Ben mentioned. If you look at what we spent in the third quarter for land purchases and the construction of new sites, that's effectively 25% of AFFO. The balance of the CapEx that we have is basically reimbursed by the tenants as they go on the site. It's spending on CapEx on existing sites, and that's basically reimbursed. So at the current spending level, using Q3 as the measure of that. At the current spending level, we can cover that CapEx with the 25% of AFFO. Frankly, that's one of the primary ways that we size the dividend at 75%.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Any more spending would probably be offset by preliminary or pre-fees that you don't count on AFFO anymore?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, well I think it's -- to the extent that we grew the business and we started to say we wanted to invest more in small cells, well that's a discrete investment, similar to the way we would think about an acquisition and we'd need to go through that math. I think the other, as we think about a more normal CapEx that we would spend in the business as we add additional tenants for the sites, that CapEx is absolutely reimbursed by the tenant.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just to make sure I'm on the same page, when you say that small cell is similar to an acquisition, does that mean that you would borrow to fund that small cell business? You may need to borrow to fund that small cell business?","Jay A. Brown","Yes. If we grow past the run rate of Q3, we would need to, yes.","W. Benjamin Moreland","And be happy to do that, to the extent there's opportunities that, just like an acquisition, as Jay said, just like -- assuming the opportunity covered the cost, we're not going to be too hard on that, the whole point of not borrowing. We've got balance sheet capacity, and we'd be prepared to use it. What I wanted to do in sizing the dividend is not put ourselves in a position where we had to do that, just to capture the existing opportunity on our current sites. And so that's what Jay was saying, at the current spend level, we're covered. But to the extent the opportunity was there, and warranted it, we'd be happy to continue to access capital and borrow some, just to cover that over time.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. Okay, I thought you were ruling that out a few minutes ago.","W. Benjamin Moreland","No, no. Glad for the clarification.","Operator","We'll go next to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to clarify some of the comments you made early -- in some of the earlier questions. We talked about this sort of $100 million sort of growth on the tower portfolio side, and it does seem as though that if we do see an increase in co-location activity, that could provide some further tailwinds for sort of an expanded opportunity there. Is that the right interpretation of how we should think about things?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Amir, I would say about that, as I was making a comment about the ebbs and flows that we'd see in the business, typically, and I would encourage you to look at this relative to the comments that the carriers are making around the CapEx and their spend in the networks, there is a natural ebb and flow that happens between the spending they make for amendments and the spending they do for new leases. Our experience has been, the dollars and the spend on the networks is relatively similar year-over-year. The allocation of where those dollars goes tends to change. And so to the extent that you were to assume there was meaningfully more new co-locations being put out, is there a possibility that, that could mean more revenue to us? Absolutely. It could also mean that the 35% of our current activity that is amendments, that number may go down, and may offset some of the increase that we see with new co-location. So as we think about the business, we tend to think about it more on a -- over a long period of time, how much revenue per tower can we add, and that 0.1 is adding about $2,400 per tower of new revenues. And we have a belief that over time, that will be a mix of new leases and amendments. And our experience has been that, that will change from year to year, but sort of results in something that looks similar to that 0.1 tenants per tower.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If I may, one other quick question on the small cell side. If we hear what the carriers are saying, particularly when it comes to allocation of capital more towards densification and capacity type initiatives, it does feel as though we should start to see potentially increased momentum around that front. You had mentioned there's been -- largely Verizon has been focused on that, but clearly, it does seem like all the carriers, at some point in time, are going to embrace this type of network architecture. How should we think about the opportunity set for accelerating growth on the small cell side, given your footprint within that arena?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Amir, this is Ben. We think that's a tremendous opportunity and one that we are actively working on capturing for Crown Castle. We have a very large and growing pipeline of network opportunities to be built, as well as co-location, and I do agree with you, and it's certainly our investment thesis that we will see the other 3 carriers adopt that architecture in a very meaningful way over time, based upon the capacity requirements of their systems and the locations of where we're building these networks. That has happened over time, various carriers and we still have -- we have a significant amount of exposure and revenue. As we said earlier, Metro PCS, for example, now under T-Mobile, all of those leases are -- have been affirmed and don't expect those to churn, which is, I think, an interesting indication of the value of the small cell networks going forward, in that these are very vital to adding capacity and densification and are not subject, at least, thus far, to the rationalization that we've seen on the tower side.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Two quick ones, and then a longer one, sorry. The AT&T transaction, would that have met your interest in dividend requirements as you currently define them with the new dividend? Secondly, your investment bankers really had weeks to look into transaction and we just had couple of hours. Did they kind of tell you what they thought the dividend yield would settle out at, when the market kind of really absorbs all this? And then third, the longer question here really, investors had been really nervous about shutdowns of cell sites and consolidation, and it didn't seem like the management suits [ph] in the industry were as nervous about it. What has really changed that from your thinking, kind of things 6 months ago, 3 months ago, or what we've seen historically? Historically, we've never really seen shutdowns like this.","Jay A. Brown","Yes, on the first question, the AT&T transaction would have met that, and we believe that would be accretive to the dividend over time. We wouldn't have done the transaction if we didn't believe the dividend was going to be higher. As Ben mentioned on the investment banker views that we got, we engaged and asked several firms to give us their views, those views were ranging, in terms of what they -- how they thought the market would react to the news as well as their opinion on what the best approach was. I think that there was a whole variety of views there, and as we looked at the information and consider both the feedback from shareholders as well as the information that we generated and analysis we did on our own, our belief was that increasing the dividend to about 75% of AFFO was the best outcome for us over a long period of time. And so there were a number of views there, as Ben mentioned in his comments, but we thought it was the best approach.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Tim, in terms of specific yield, we'll let the market sort that out and tell us over time. I would offer the following observation though. We're currently trading this initial yield as of last night, and that's about a 4% yield. That would put us above the REIT composite by a significant margin, and I like my new REIT colleagues, but I wouldn't trade places with their business models. And so when I look at our opportunity for stability and growth, as the mission-critical infrastructure provider in the U.S. market, I think that's a fabulous business model, and as we've said a couple of times on this call and I'll repeat, the fact that we got built-in growth on top of that dividend, I think is clearly unique, and the market will sort out what the appropriate dividend yield is over time and the total return expectation, but we'll certainly be out working to help them understand the resiliency and the sustainability of this business through lots of different macroeconomic cycles where, back since we went public initially, we've outperformed the S&P 500 by sort of 4x, and that's right through all of the different cycles that we've experienced since that time. In terms of your last question on the churn, what's different this time, I think it is a little bit different this time. As you go forward, there is rationalization that can occur in these networks, particularly around overlap sites, plus a little more, which is what we're forecasting. And yet at the same time, we're seeing continued new cell site density added, which is forecasted in our revenue growth, as we've talked about. So I think we've probably accurately captured it. You could say, well, leasing may be a little lower if they're actually just repurposing some of the cell sites, that's true. But on a net basis, I think it probably comes out about where we've said. So we'll have to wait and see how that develops over time, but I think it is a little bit different, particularly in that we have 3 happening here in fairly -- much on top of each other.","Jay A. Brown","There seems to be in the comments, and at least what they're indicating to us is their plans around their networks, more of a focus on spectral efficiency than what there's been in past consolidations. And so that's likely the reason why we're seeing more than the overlap sites go away. T-Mobile's comments publicly about the Metro sites. I think Metro has about 12,000 macro sites. T-Mobile has indicated that 10,000 of those 12,000 are going to go away, and their description, along with the other's descriptions is largely around, reharvesting and reusing that spectrum in a more efficient way by taking down greater portions of the network than what we've seen in past consolidations.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And any idea why American Towers is not seeing the same effects that you guys are?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I wouldn't have any comment on American Tower. You'd need to ask them.","Operator","We'll go next to Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You touched on this before, but I wanted to get a little bit more specifics on the split of the churn coming from the acquired networks. Is the majority coming from Clearwire, I think, and is it mostly the urban market? I think you had mentioned before that the contract was going to be up for renewal, I think, in '15 and '16. And when you look at the PCS, T-Mo, I believe you had mentioned that the overlap is about 2% of your revenues and you had a contract until '17. AT&T, Leap was similar, so you did mention that the rationalization piece is a little beyond overlap. So can you maybe provide a bit more color on what is included in the overlap, and what do you think is beyond that?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I wouldn't put the majority on any one of those tenants. The ranges that we provided, we intentionally didn't go customer by customer on the ranges. It gives us that a little bit of flexibility as it shakes out over the next several years, as those 3 operators decommission their networks. We would expect it to move to some degree, which is why we tried to ban the exposure. As you noted, when those announcements were made, we indicated the overlap sites was in the neighborhood of about $145 million of sites that were overlapped. So the incremental amount of roughly $55 million of additional churn exposure that we believe we have, those would be on sites where they're not necessarily -- where they're not overlapping with the acquired network. And my comments to the prior question around spectral efficiency, I think probably best answer the why there. In the disclosure that we had previously given, we gave the average term outstanding for the leases. And so as we kind of work through that, obviously, you can see that average basically work itself out as we've shown over the longer period of time what our exposure is to those 3 networks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest Investment Bank.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions here. I'm trying to figure out, first of all, with regard to the dividend, was there any thought process around, rather than returning capital to shareholders. Rather than doing that, maybe spend on targeting acceleration in that 0.1 per year for the AT&T and T-Mobile portfolios? And then #2, does this now make you guys start to think a little bit about international investments more seriously? Because clearly, we're seeing higher growth rates, organic growth rates in international than we are here in the U.S.","W. Benjamin Moreland","I don't know where to start with that. I didn't catch the, if you spend to increase the leasing, boy, if it was that simple, we would have done it 15 years ago. There's no discretionary spend on our part, that is inhibiting the leasing of the carrier towers or all the towers that we own today. So it's -- we're actively out pursuing every one of those opportunities and that's what's resident in the $100 million of revenue growth that we're seeing today, Michael. So the dividend again, how we sized it, was essentially to retain the capital to pursue the organic opportunities that we see today. The international opportunities that are out there, we'll continue to evaluate them, as I've said on these calls many times, against the appropriate sort of risk-adjusted rate of return we think, and -- is appropriate against the asset prices that are out there. In so doing, you have to look at what local borrowing costs are, what exposure to FX would potentially do and all the other factors that would involve an evaluation such as that. Thus far, in our judgment, the investments we've made in the U.S. have a higher risk-adjusted return profile opportunity, but we'll let that sort itself out over time.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes, and where I was going with the first question was, whether there's anything that you guys could put in place, rather than paying a dividend to use that capital rather to increase the tenant per tower, the incremental increase on a per year basis, is there anything that you contemplate or any thoughts around things you could do to accelerate that? It sounds like the answer is no, but that's where --","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, no. That we -- I can assure you, we're capturing every one of those incremental revenue opportunities. That's our core business, and what most everybody that works here is focused on every day. But just to be complete, the competing thought that we had lots of discussion with shareholders and we've engaged in this in a very productive way before, would be to take the $1.1 billion of dividends we're now going to pay out and buy shares with it, retain the flexibility until the NOL has burned off, and buy shares opportunistically with it. Potentially, like on a day like today, when we announced that there's $200 million of churn coming. So we specifically rejected that. We understand how that drives, on a per share basis, higher growth in the short term, but we think long term, the right approach was to demonstrate the sustainability through the quarterly return of a material part of this cash flow to shareholders and have a very significant component of their total return be made up by the current distribution plus the contracted escalator growth and then the opportunity that we see to continue to add organic and external growth in the business. But that would have been the competing agenda, and one we respect and one we've executed very successfully. In the past, we've bought $2.7 billion worth of stock over time, but the course we've set for the reasons that I mentioned in my notes at the beginning of this call, we think is the best long-term approach for the company.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And just very quickly, do you guys have an expiration schedule for the NOLs? Is there an average? Or do you have a ladder that you can share with us?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, they started between 2020 and 2030. The average is about 2025.","Operator","And we'll go next to Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.","Spencer Kurn - New Street Research LLP","I was wondering if you could just point us to any time frame for signs we can look for an acceleration in your overall organic growth from the AT&T or T-Mobile towers that you're seeing?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I think if you asked us today, as we mentioned are performing in line with our underwriting model. We took a 10-year view on those models, and they're performing right at about the average that we expected over 10 years, and out of the gate are right there, so we're not anticipating, or frankly, do we need to anticipate an acceleration of activity in order to get to our returns. So our game plan is to continue to run the asset as we've been doing out of the gate, and that will provide a terrific return. But it's early days. And as I mentioned earlier on this call, the primary co-locator in this market has been Verizon, since we've owned these 2 new portfolios and so as we would expect and certainly, as we underwrote, we will return to a period of time, I think we're already been beginning to see it, where the other 3 are going to need to infill their networks with increased density, where these portfolios will certainly be available for them to do that. So that's part of our underwriting thesis.","Spencer Kurn - New Street Research LLP","Got it. And I guess if I look at your organic revenue growth guidance before decommissionings, it looks like you're implying a modest slowdown from where you came in this past quarter, and I would've thought that excluding the negative impacts of churn, we'd see an acceleration into next year.","Jay A. Brown","Yes. Quarter-to-quarter, they're a bit challenging to do. I would tell you typically in the back half of the years, we see more activity than in the front half. So I would encourage you to look at things more on a holistic, full year over full year basis. We're forecasting, as we've mentioned a couple of times on this call, full year '15 to look pretty similar to full year '14. Well up about a little bit higher.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, up about $20 million off of '14 numbers.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ana Goshko with Bank of America.","Ana Goshko - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to ask you, you continue to mention the goal of achieving an investment-grade rating, but wanted to understand what you believe or what you know from conversations with the rating agencies, what the catalyst is to achieve that, because you are at your target leverage ratio, with a muted growth outlook, at least in the near-term, the EBITDA metrics will not be improving, and then with a higher dividend, there's really not cash left to pay down debt in any material fashion.","Jay A. Brown","Honestly, it's the decision of the rating agencies as to where they place our ratings on the credit facilities, and the conversations we've been having with them over several years is the same conversation we've had on this call this morning, and have for a long period of time, around the risk profile of the assets, the stability of the cash flows and where that should be rated. I think relative, if we compare ourselves to other real estate businesses, we feel like our credit statistics are very favorable, and the rating agencies over time have embraced that view, and we have seen them gradually increase the ratings and increase the appetite for leverage on these businesses, which we think is appropriate. We don't anticipate, and you've correctly pointed out, we don't anticipate taking a significant portion of our cash and paying down debt, but we do expect the business to continue to grow, and so we'll achieve deleveraging of the business just through natural growth and EBITDA, rather than the pay-down of debt. And we certainly, on the call this morning, wanted to make the comment and the statement that as we think about our dividend payout, increasing the dividend payout meaningfully, we think, as an important component of that is to stay on this path that we've been on towards achieving an investment-grade credit rating, and that's certainly our intention and plan at this point.","W. Benjamin Moreland","And part of our analysis that we reflected on earlier in the call was that in order to get -- and it's been a long-held view we've had, in order to get the maximum appreciation and value out of this dividend stream that we're now undertaking, an investment-grade rating is probably the right way to accomplish that over time. As Jay says, we don't expect to do anything unnatural to get there, but I think we'll get there over time through continued growth, and I think that's the right way to think about the business.","Ana Goshko - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 follow-ups. So one, do you believe that the increase in the dividend from the agency standpoint has sort of set you back? Or are you still on the same path or the same place on achieving the rating?","Jay A. Brown","No, I don't think it set us back. I think the communication we're having with them on this is similar to what we said on this call, that we intend to continue on the path towards an investment grade credit rating and deleveraging, as we see growth in EBITDA, and so that's sort of the plan.","Ana Goshko - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, Jay, you did say publicly, and very theoretically, on the potential to acquire the Verizon assets that, if that were the case, you would be willing to take leverage back up over the 6x target, at least temporarily. But with the higher amount of cash flow that's going to be supporting the dividend, wondering if that's still the case.","Jay A. Brown","Yes. I think all of those comments still hold. If we were to take leverage up, that would be -- well start if we were to do the transaction, we would have to believe that's accretive to the dividend and to AFFO per share over a long period of time. And we'd expect that, that would be the case, frankly, in both the short and the long term. The second part of it, around how we would finance it, I think we would still be open to taking leverage up to the high end of our targeted level of leverage range, maybe slightly above it. However, the only way we would be interested in doing that is if we had a plan to quickly delever back down to where we've been aiming towards to -- in your prior questions, around an investment-grade credit rating. So I think if -- we would be open to doing that. We think the Verizon towers could represent a very unique opportunity in the U.S. market. There are not, we don't believe, very many U.S. assets left of any substantial size. So if that were to happen, we think that's, in a sense, a bit of an anomaly and a really unique opportunity. So if it were there, we'd have to consider the appropriate way to finance it, and I think on the table, in those conversations, would certainly be a thought around leverage.","W. Benjamin Moreland","I think with that, we'll wrap up. We've gone long this morning, and I appreciate those that have stuck with us here. We wanted to make sure we captured all of your questions. We are very excited about our future prospects, and today, I think, is a very important day for Crown Castle as we've now proceeded with it. What I think is an unprecedented and unique opportunity for shareholders to invest in the U.S. wireless business with us, an infrastructure that will carry a very significant and growing current return, and we are very pleased with how we're positioned. So thank you for your attention this morning, and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Fiona McKone","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us as we review our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results.","With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.","To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will discuss throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements and information based on management's current expectations. Although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurances that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.","Information about potential factors that could affect the company's financial results is available in the press release and in the Risk Factors sections of the company's filings with the SEC.

Brown","Thanks, Fiona, and good morning, everyone. We had an excellent 2013. In addition to delivering very strong results throughout the year, we achieved several significant accomplishments.","In December, we completed our $4.85 billion tower transaction with AT&T and have begun the integration process. We believe that this transaction will be accretive to our long-term growth rates and enhancing shareholder value. Further, this transaction solidifies our strategic objective of being the leader in shared wireless infrastructure in the U.S., which we believe is the largest, fastest-growing and most profitable wireless market in the world.","Also during 2013, we completed the integration of the T-Mobile tower and NextG acquisitions that we closed in 2012. These expansions of our asset portfolio position us as the preeminent supplier of wireless infrastructure in the U.S., with the most towers and small cell networks. Further, the timing of these acquisitions provide us with a large portfolio of well-located assets, just as the network densification part of the LTE deployment cycle is accelerating, and the carriers are transitioning their focus from coverage to network quality.","Additionally, in the past 2 years, we have completed more than $9 billion in financing activity. Also during 2013, we completed the necessary steps to convert to a REIT and announced our plan to initiate a quarterly dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2014. On January 1 of this year, we commenced operating at the REIT.","In addition to these meaningful events, we consistently delivered strong results above our original expectations while maintaining financial flexibility to make opportunistic investments related to our core business that we believe will maximize long-term shareholder value.","For the full year, as shown on Slide 3, we grew site rental revenue by 18%, adjusted EBITDA by 16% and adjusted funds from operations per share by 40% compared to 2012. These results were considerably above our expectations at the beginning of 2013.","Further, our Services business continued to outperform our expectations, delivering strong growth in 2013 as we continue to work very hard to meet customer deployment objectives and facilitate customers' installations on our sites.","With that, let me turn to Slide 5 as I highlight some of the results for the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we generated site rental revenue of $651 million, up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2012. This 14% growth included the benefit of 3% from the AT&T tower transaction. Further, churn and Australia currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 1% each.","We saw a significant increase in U.S. new leasing activity in the fourth quarter of 2013, representing a more than twofold increase compared to the same period in 2012. This more than twofold increase includes both new licenses and amendment activity, with new license activity representing 65% of new leasing activity. We believe this activity reflects the carriers' focus on deploying their equipment on additional sites to help ease capacity related issues, commonly referred to as site densification. Further during the fourth quarter of 2013, only 19% of total installations were covered by pre-sold leasing agreements compared to over 70% of the installations in the same quarter of the prior year.","I would also note that we are seeing tremendous leasing activities on our small cell networks as carriers look for ways to improve their networks in areas not served by traditional macro sites. With regard to our other metrics for the quarter, site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenue plus cost of operations, was $464 million, up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $468 million, up 13% from the fourth quarter of 2012. AFFO was $359 million, up 48% from the fourth quarter of 2012.","Turning to investments and liquidity as shown on Slide 6. We completed a number of meaningful financings during the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we raised approximately $4 billion of net proceeds through the issuance of 41.4 million shares of common stock at $74 per share and 9.8 million shares of 4.5% mandatory convertible preferred stock at $100 per share. In addition, we borrowed $500 million of incremental Term Loan B and $200 million of incremental Term Loan A, the proceeds of which, together with cash on hand and drawings under our revolving credit facility, were used to pay for the AT&T tower transaction.","Further, over the past 2 months, we repriced our credit facility, effectively reducing our per annum interest rate on our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A by 50 basis points. Additionally, we extended the maturities of our revolving credit facility and the vast majority of our term loans.","We currently have $374 million drawn under our revolving credit facility and undrawn capacity of approximately $1.1 billion. After giving effect to the aforementioned amendments, our current weighted average cost of debt stands at 4.3%, and the weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6 years. Pro forma for the AT&T tower transaction and the recent financings, we ended 2013 with total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 5.5x, and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense of 4.1x.","Further, our balanced approach to financing the recent acquisitions allows us to maintain financial flexibility and to continue to operate within our stated leverage target of between 4x and 6x adjusted EBITDA. I suspect we'll see our leverage ratio move towards the midpoint of our stated leverage target during 2014 as a result of the expected growth in adjusted EBITDA.","During the fourth quarter, we invested $182 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $24 million on our land lease purchase program, which continues to perform very well as we work to extend the ground lease maturity and ground ownership of the land beneath our towers. In total during 2013, we extended over 1,000 land leases and purchased the land beneath more than 800 of our towers. As of today, we own or control for more than 20 years the land beneath towers representing approximately 72% of our site rental gross margin. In fact, today, 34% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own.","Further, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 29 years. Having completed over 15,000 land transactions, we believe this activity has resulted in the most secure land position in the industry based on land ownership and final ground lease expiration. Our team is doing a great job on this important endeavor as we remain focused on achieving the long-term benefits of protecting our margins and assets and controlling our largest operating expense.","Of the remaining capital expenditures, we spent $21 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $138 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures, the latter consisting of $79 million on existing sites and $58 million on the construction of new sites, primarily small cell construction activity.","Sustaining capital expenditures in the fourth quarter was higher than the third quarter by approximately $10 million, primarily as a result of completing some tower maintenance work we had anticipated for 2014 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the purchase of some additional IT equipment.","For the full year 2013, as illustrated on Slide 7 of the presentation, site rental revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, up $379 million or 18% from 2012. This 18% growth included the benefit of approximately 13% from acquisitions, specifically T-Mobile and AT&T towers, as well as the NextG acquisition.","For the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, for the first quarter of 2014, as shown on Slide 8, the sequential growth in site rental revenue from Q4 2013 to Q1 2014 includes the benefit of approximately $85 million of additional site rental revenue from the AT&T towers. This sequential growth in organic site rental revenue is muted by approximately $2 million less benefit from nonrecurring items than we had in the fourth quarter of 2013, iDEN-related churn of approximately $2 million in the first quarter and approximately $1 million from a lower-assumed Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate.","Further, AFFO in the first quarter includes $11 million of dividends on preferred stock related to the AT&T tower financing and lower contribution from net prepaid rent of approximately $27 million than we had in the previous quarter.","Let me spend a minute walking through the changes that we included in our revised 2014 outlook as shown on Slides 9 and 10. Our previous outlook, which was issued on October 21, 2013, included the expected operating results from the AT&T tower transaction but not the related financing costs as such financings had not yet been completed. The impact from the financing activities related to the AT&T tower transaction includes $44 million in dividends from the 4.5% mandatory convertible preferred shares and $25 million of incremental interest associated with borrowings under the senior credit facility. As such, we anticipate the AT&T towers will contribute approximately $176 million to $186 million to our 2014 AFFO, inclusive of the aforementioned financing costs.","Further, we have increased the midpoint of our full year 2014 outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $20 million, primarily reflecting the higher expected service gross margin contribution. And we adjusted our 2014 outlook for AFFO to reflect the aforementioned financing costs and increased expectation for services.","With regards to site rental revenue, we expect approximately $175 million to $185 million of organic cash revenue growth in 2014, ignoring the impact from straight-line revenue adjustments. We expect this $175 million to $185 million of organic cash revenue growth to be comprised equally of new tenant activity and cash escalation. As we noted in the press release, we expect a 30% increase on a same-tower basis in new leasing activity in 2014 when compared to 2013.","Further, we expect that only about 10% of our activity will be covered by the pre-sold leasing arrangements that we have discussed previously. In addition, our 2014 outlook includes the negative impact of churn of approximately $50 million or 2% of our site rental revenue.","In essence, the cash revenue growth from our contracted lease escalations during the calendar year 2014 exceeds the expected impact from total churn. Approximately half of the expected churn is typical churn activity, and half is from Sprint decommissioning of their legacy Nextel iDEN network.","Based on Sprint's stated intention to decommission their iDEN network and our contractual terms with Sprint, we expect approximately 3% of our run rate site rental revenues to be impacted by the iDEN decommissioning over time. These iDEN leases have effective term end dates spread evenly throughout 2014 and 2015. As a result, we expect the reduction of site rental revenues from the iDEN decommissioning to be approximately 1% in 2014 with the remaining 2% impact coming after calendar year 2014.","With respect to 2014 adjusted EBITDA, we anticipate that site rental direct expenses and G&A on our existing portfolio of sites will grow approximately 1% from 2013, and the contribution from services gross margin will be approximately $15 million lower than the contribution we benefited from in 2013.","Further, our forecast for 2014 AFFO is negatively impacted by approximately $17 million in expected sustaining capital expenditures to remodel and expand certain of our office facilities, which we would not expect to recur in the foreseeable future. As we previously announced, we commenced operating at the REIT on January 1, 2014, and expect to initiate a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share beginning this quarter.","Based on our expectation for growth in our business, we believe that we can grow our dividend over the next 5 years by at least 15% annually while consuming the vast majority of our taxable net operating losses before the year 2020. We ended 2013 with approximately $2.3 billion in tax net operating losses.","As shown on Slide 10, during 2014, we expect to generate approximately $1.5 billion of AFFO. Based on our expected dividend payments and forecasted growth, we expect to be able to continue to make significant investments with our cash flow in activities, including investing in acquisition; the construction of new sites, including small cell networks; land purchases and the purchase of our own security that we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share.","Our long-standing approach to capital allocation, combined with strong operating results, has driven significant growth in AFFO per share. In fact, based on our 2014 outlook, the compounded annual growth rate of AFFO per share from 2007 through our expectations for 2014 is in excess of 17%.","Importantly, we have been able to produce this growth while positioning ourselves for future growth without increasing the risk profile of our business. We believe our results reflect the value of the disciplined investments we've made over a long period of time through share purchases and U.S. acquisitions and the industry-leading customer service we provide.","In summary, we are excited about our leadership role in the -- in wireless infrastructure. Our announced AT&T transaction furthers our focus on the U.S. market and expands our portfolio in the top 100 markets while increasing our expected growth rates of revenue and cash flow. And I'm very excited about 2014 as we continue to execute around our core business and integrate the AT&T towers into our portfolio.","Wrapping up my comments, I'd like to thank Fiona for her nearly 7 years of managing the IR function at Crown Castle. She has done a terrific job. She's taking on another leadership role inside the company that begins next week. Son Nguyen, who is a VP in our Corporate Finance Group and has been with the company for nearly 5 years, is assuming the IR role in her place.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Thanks, Jay, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning. We obviously have a lot to cover at year end. And I want to add my thanks to Fiona for 7 years of great work in the IR role. And honestly, we'll miss that refined Irish accent on these calls.","I want to take a couple minutes to reflect on the tremendous year we had on a number of fronts. We accomplished a number of milestones in 2013, exceeding our financial targets for the year while continuing to execute on our strategic objective of growing our leadership position in the U.S. market.","I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the significant accomplishments of our Crown Castle professionals as we successfully integrated the T-Mobile acquisition, expanded our Small Cell business, processed record application volumes associated with LTE upgrades and co-locations and gear [ph] our Services business by successfully meeting customer demand for installation and upgrade activities on our sites.","Since April of 2012, we have invested approximately $9 billion in acquisitions that we believe significantly enhance our portfolio and our position as the premier shared wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S, with 40% more towers in the U.S. than our nearest competitor and the largest small cell operator in the U.S.","Today, with approximately 40,000 towers and over 11,000 small cell nodes in the U.S. and a presence in all of the top 100 markets, we have unmatched capability to efficiently accommodate wireless carrier demands for more sites to improve and enhance wireless networks. We have enjoyed considerable success with past acquisitions and believe the result of our recent acquisitions will be no different.","As shown on Slide 11, we have proven over the short and long term that we are able to transact, integrate, lease and operate carrier assets in ways that create significant value, having roughly quadrupled the initial yield on our legacy carrier portfolio assets. These assets continue to increase their cash flow and resulting yields to this day.","Our transaction with AT&T is the sixth wireless carrier portfolio transaction we've completed in the U.S. I would also note that our T-Mobile transaction that we completed just over a year ago is tracking ahead of our original acquisition model.","Simply stated, our strategy is to replicate the growth in site rental revenue and margin we've achieved on past transactions on these most recent additions to our portfolio. We remain focused on the U.S. market, the largest and fastest-growing wireless market in the world, where the ability of the wireless carriers to make a profitable investments is most apparent, and barriers to entry remain high.","The U.S. market is unique in that network quality continues to be a differentiator. The strong correlation between network investment and low consumer churn necessitates the carriers to continue upgrading their wireless networks to improve network quality, increase capacity and add functionality in order to remain competitive and grow. As a result, we are enjoying unprecedented levels of network upgrade activity as each of the 4 major wireless carriers are adding LTE coverage and capacity at the present time.","Additionally, as shown on Slide 12, the U.S. market is uniquely attractive to us due to its relative size and robustness compared to other markets. Considering the country, geopolitical, currency and other risks associated with operating in international markets, I believe the U.S. market offers the most compelling risk-adjusted returns for capital investment in wireless infrastructure.","Further, we are -- we believe the timing of the NextG, T-Mobile and AT&T acquisitions is fortuitous, as network densification activity accelerates, and we are well positioned to capture additional leasing revenue across our extensive urban-centric portfolio. We have completed the integration of the T-Mobile towers and are fully engaged in integrating the newly acquired AT&T towers. And I would like to extend my appreciation to the staff and our friends at AT&T who are assisting us with this orderly transition. In fact, carriers are already asking us to prioritize applications on our new AT&T sites, which we are working diligently to accomplish.","Moving on to small cells. We continue to exceed our expectations as carriers augment capacity. Our small cell networks offer similar co-location opportunities to towers. And as we have stated in the past, the returns we are seeing from our investment in small cells are similar to, if not better than, the returns from macro towers. We continue to believe that small cells play an integral role in solving capacity and coverage issues in areas not traditionally served by macro tower sites.","In fact, we have seen tremendous growth in our small cell network activity where we have more than doubled adjusted EBITDA since April of 2012 when we closed on the NextG transaction. Today, we have an extensive network of small cells with over 11,000 nodes and a robust pipeline of additional nodes to come.","Further, we have rights to over 6,000 miles of fiber. These nodes and fiber are in the largest, most densely populated and highly demand -- highest demand markets such as Manhattan, San Francisco, Southern California, Philadelphia and Boston, to name a few.","We continue to expand our small cell networks meaningfully, and we expect our investment in this area to be higher in 2014 with expected similar returns to what we've achieved in the past. In addition to a strong year of site leasing, our U.S. Services business performed exceptionally well as we continue to capture more of the revenue opportunities associated with assisting our customers and locating on or upgrading installations on our sites.","This increase in services activity reflects the unprecedented activity we are seeing from all 4 major carriers as they upgrade to LTE and is attributable to the confidence our customers have in Crown Castle. As regularly expressed in our customer surveys, they consistently rank us as delivering the highest customer satisfaction in the industry.","Before I turn the call over for questions, I would like to reiterate some of the strong fundamental trends in wireless that are continuing to drive our business. While we were all very familiar with the growth in demand for constant mobile connectivity, premised by our own increasing dependence on a variety of mobile devices, thanks to the continued rollout of 4G LTE networks by all 4 major carriers, mobile users are able to consume more data than ever.","While in the past, the transition that drove this data consumption was from feature phones to smartphones, now it's the upgrade path from low-end to high-end smartphones with each generation adding approximately 40% more traffic by device.","iPhone users consume almost twice the data per session than an average Android phone user consumes, and the iPhone 4, 4s and 5 held the top 3 places on the list of most data-hungry devices. Amazingly, Cisco reports that data consumption on mobile devices should surpass data consumption on traditional wired PCs by 2016. In fact, Verizon has said that it expects data traffic to grow by a factor of 6x to 7x over the next few years. Further, they've also announced they expect to launch Voice over LTE service this year, acquiring existing networks to be 20% to 30% more dense for data compared to data-only LTE.","Finally, as we look to the future, the expanding LTE networks are expected to accelerate the growth of countless machine-to-machine applications, including connected automobiles and wearable devices, which represent a huge catalyst for future data consumption. While connected cars and other machine-to-machine applications such as alarm-monitoring systems, vehicle tracking, consumer electronics, smart grid solutions, medical device alerts and a host of other new products, play a very small role in today's environment, such applications built for a mobile environment are an emerging reality and will require significant investment in wireless networks to ensure that there is sufficient network depth and capacity to accommodate even higher usage. Needless to say, we look forward to the future.","So in wrapping up, let me conclude by saying we had a very busy and successful year, and I can assure you we are geared up for another one in 2014. We are in the midst of a very robust environment for wireless network growth as has been well-documented. I want to thank our team for their accomplishments, and look forward to reporting more of their successes to you in the future.","With that, operator, would you please turn the call over for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Mr. Ric Prentiss from Raymond James.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions. One, Jay, on the SG&A in the quarter, it seemed to jump up quite a bit. Wondering if that had anything to do with the AT&T transaction either special charges, legal fees, et cetera, or is that kind of the new run rate we should expect going forward?","Jay A. Brown","Yes. I think the movements you see -- part of it is that we staffed up for the AT&T tower transaction, as well as the integration process. Some of it also is related to the higher level of services that we're seeing, and I would expect that to be kind of our new run rate. I would point out, as I did in my prepared remarks, if you look at the total cost structure for 2014 over 2013, net of the direct expenses that we'll get from the AT&T tower transaction, that our total costs look like they're going up about 1% on a like-for-like basis, and that would include the additional G&A that we would expect it include. And I'm doing that on a cash basis and ignoring any stock-based comp that would be included in the G&A numbers.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","In the past, you've mentioned that certain percent of your SG&A is really related to the Services business. If the Services business drops down in some way, obviously, it's great today with it being so strong, remind us again how much of the SG&A could come out as Services business maybe comes down in, say, 1 or 2 years?","Jay A. Brown","Yes. Ric, we think conservatively at least half. It may be more than that. As you can imagine in our business, most of the activity that we all work on has to do with the incremental activity rather than continuing to operate the base of leases that we've already put on the tower. So we think it's at least half, and it may be -- it might be more than that.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then on the M&A front, we noticed the transaction in January from CPS in Texas, I think. Is that included in your guidance? I think it was a $41 million transaction, and what other M&A opportunities might there be in the U.S. or is Europe of interest to you?","Jay A. Brown","It was included in our outlook, and I'll let Ben kind of speak to more broadly internationally. It was included in our outlook, and from time to time, we do see some smaller opportunities. I talked about the financial flexibility that we think we have related to cash flow. We have about $1.5 billion of cash flow in 2014 that we would expect to have, about 1\/3 of that being allocated to dividend, about 1\/3 of it to CapEx activities that look similar to what we've done in past years, and that remaining 1\/3 is open for us to invest in what we think maximizes long-term AFFO per share, which could include acquisitions, maybe some more land purchases, opportunities that we see around the small cell space or buying back our own stock.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. In the AT&T transaction, as you saw how we paid for it, we were very deliberate in not taking ourselves out of the market going forward. We're pretty good at integrating assets. We feel like while it's a lot of work in 2014, we certainly wanted to be in the marketplace as other assets would present themselves that would meet our criteria of adding growth and cash flow against our fallback position always is buying our own securities. So, Ric, to your question, we will continue and have lots of balance sheet capacity to look at other opportunities wherever they are. You mentioned Western Europe. Certainly, that's something we would be interested in. As you've seen us over the years, we always look at it on a price versus sort of risk-reward basis and what the lease-up opportunity is against what we think is available in the U.S. market or even more simply in our own securities. So we have the capacity. That was sized that way on purpose so that we did not take ourselves out of play, and we feel very comfortable with where we are today.","Operator","And your next question will come from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I've got 2 questions. First, on spectrum, given some of the auctions that are upcoming this year and then T-Mobile's purchase of 700 megahertz licenses, how does that affect you in terms of potential incremental revenues, with those overlays or are a lot of those overlay activities already contemplated in -- under the terms of your various carrier agreement? And then on the topic of small cells, I was maybe interested in getting a sense of the opportunities that you see. Is it primarily outdoor? Is it venue? Is it indoor? Maybe just a little bit more color to where you're seeing the leasing interest and where your investments are going to be focused?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure, Jon. I'll take that. This is Ben. For the most part, the additional activities we would expect for deploying additional spectrum is going to be incremental amendment revenue to us. As we go forward, that will typically be the case as we've sort of run near the end of the scope of these presold agreements as Jay mentioned in his prepared remarks. So we would expect, over time, that would be an incremental source of revenue. It's hard to put too fine a point in that in terms of what's in the guidance and what's not, because it's an imperfect science. What I will tell you is as we sit here in the third week of January, we can see in our pipeline about half of 2014's leasing expectation, and that's already in the pipeline, and I would say that's about normal. So we feel good about where we are. We're starting off the year very strong. And again, I had a comment in the press release that we reiterated on this call, we expect 30% up on same-tower basis leasing '14 versus '13. So obviously, that's moving, and there's a lot going on in the marketplace. With small cells, we continue to see opportunities, both outdoor and in indoor venues. The venues, by definition, are going to be probably over time a smaller source of new incremental business for us. It's just a smaller addressable market and universe, but it is something we're pursuing. It's something we're having success with. But I would say the more significant opportunity where we're spending more capital today is on outdoor, which is in highly dense population bases, urban centers, where you're essentially doing an underlay build strategy where macro sites have sort of gotten to their capacity. And we're seeing, as we mentioned in our comments, very, very good take up there in the market as the reality becomes more and more clear that there's just a lot of these markets where the cell density has to get to a point where it's so small that these are basically street light and telephone pole-type installations just in very, very small cells where they're reusing the spectrum because of the capacity requirement in these markets. So we remain very bullish and I think there's certainly a market on both indoor and outdoor, but over time, it looks to us like the outdoor is going to be significantly bigger.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Philip Cusick from JPMorgan.","Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to follow up on the iDEN side of, in terms of the churn, if it doesn't materialize in the worst-case scenario, how should we think about guidance? Would it be more the bottom end of leasing revenue guidance coming up or could we see both the bottom and top end increase?","Jay A. Brown","Now, Richard, I think in part that depends on the timing of when that were to occur. As I mentioned in my comments, these iDEN leases come to their contractual term end dates during 2014 and 2015 spread evenly, and so it's possible that ultimately, we don't get to a point where we see a full 3% churn. But that may occur in calendar year 2015, at which point it would have no impact on the outlook that we've given here. And during the first quarter, we saw an amount of churn that we -- that's in line with the outlook that we gave. And so I think at this point, I would just kind of leave it at that, and then we'll have to update you as we move through the course of the year and see where ultimately they come out because the timing is important in terms of how much impact it would have.","Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And in terms of the services revenue, I mean, that's a big number last year, and I think we're expecting some sort of falloff for this year. What kind of changed over the past few months that gives you confidence that it seems like it's a pretty flat number this year versus down in some significant way?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Well, we're just continuing to execute for customers, frankly, and we're continuing to increase our market share, the addressable opportunities around construction and preconstruction services in virtually every market area of the country that we operate in. And so we're continuing to capture more of what's out there. And as you know, for years, we've been conservative in how we guide and how we forecast that number. We've never seen ourselves generating $200 million of service margin, which is what we did almost in 2013. Jay mentioned in our guidance, we've haircut that $15 million. If we outperform, we'll outperform. But there's a big opportunity out there in the market, and we're -- we think it makes great strategic sense. Not only are we making money doing it, which is obviously a pretty good outcome, but it also gives us a very high-touch experience in interacting with customers and their vendors so that we're very engaged in what their deployment plans and needs are. It also gives us great control over the asset and what's going on at the asset. And since we're the permanent owner of these 40,000 sites, we are pretty interested in what's happening on the site, and that's the way we maximize the outcome and the opportunity of co-locations over time on these towers. So there's lots of great reasons for us to continue to do this, and we're very, very pleased with the outcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen from Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","Based on the midpoint of your guidance, it appears that the net impact of prepaid rent increases by just $3.5 million in 2014. Given the increase we saw in Q4, why do you expect this to stabilize in 2014? Is it the AT&T MLA that's sort of phasing out? Or is it something else? And then what do you think this will look like in 2015?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, Kevin, I think as we've talked about in the past, prepaid rent is a function of a couple of different things. It's a function of activity that we see around the network and how much investment is being made by the carriers. And secondly, it's based on how those carriers ultimately would like to structure their arrangements with us. We have been very successful over the last several years of passing nearly all of the CapEx that we incur as we upgrade sites to hold additional tenants, we've been able to pass that on to the carrier. And so there's a bit of a pricing question there and a bit of a question around activity. I think similar to Ben's comments that he made around Services, I think we will have been and will continue to be a bit conservative as we think about forecasting prepaid -- the prepaid rent that we receive. But thus far, we've done very well at that. And I would point out, we get a lot of questions, and it seems like this topic has been a bit of a hot one over the last couple of years as people have tried to figure out components of cash and noncash revenue. And when you look out total site rental revenue, our guide for 2014 is nearly $3 billion of site rental revenue. And the noncash component, after you work through all the puts and takes, is less than $10 million on a $3 billion revenue number. And so I think we're happy to talk about it. I think we've talked about it in great detail. At a really high level, the GAAP numbers, our reported numbers, are very similar to what we're seeing in terms of cash running through the income statement. And our focus has been, as we think about cash flow per share and the way that we operate the business, we're really focused on, what is the cash outcome? And so as we think about the relationships with the carriers, as well as how we operate the business, we drive it all the way down to the cash level. And today, as I look forward to 2014, the differences between sort of cash and noncash items and everything, by the time they all wash out is basically the same.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","And just a quick follow-up. Your guidance assumes kind of, based on historical quarter-over-quarter growth, kind of a deceleration from Q1 to Q4. Is this just the impact of the iDEN churn phasing in or are you just being conservative here?","Jay A. Brown","I think I mentioned a couple of the items that are impacting that sequential growth. It is the iDEN, a bit of it would be FX, and then another portion of it would be as we talk about the onetime items moving from quarter to quarter. And over the course of the year, I'm assuming as you think about the rest of the quarters throughout 2014, you have a similar dynamic at play as you look forward [indiscernible].","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","What are you seeing on Clearwire, the 2.5 build at this point from Sprint?","W. Benjamin Moreland","We're seeing a bunch of applications, service revenue opportunity, not a real significant revenue in terms of site rental recurring revenue for the most part, but very significant opportunity to facilitate their installation. And again, we're talking about on existing sites. We expect over time to have capacity upgrades and infill sites coming from Sprint and T-Mobile, for that matter. Right now, just to characterize the market for 2014, we're seeing a very significant amount of co-location activity with Verizon and AT&T as they've announced their desire to add sites to their network. Still in the process of the initial build, if you will, and finishing that up at the Sprint and T-Mobile level. But we fully expect over time to see more infill sites from Sprint and T-Mobile as their network demands require, but that's kind of [indiscernible].","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","So that's your upside case, is revenue recognition from Sprint and T-Mobile in '14?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I think so. As they move into the site sort of infill process that seems to run through the marketplace, that's likely where we see the next wave of demand coming. But I don't want any way to diminish what we see this year already. There's a big pipeline out there. It's not insignificant. To tell you guys, in January, we expect to do 30% more on a same-tower basis. That's movement around here.","Operator","Your next question will come from Michael Rollins from Citi.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Was wondering, the $180 million of new revenue that you're expecting for 2014, did that include the impact from the AT&T tower acquisition? And whether it does or doesn't, can you give us a sense of the contributions you're looking for in terms of growth from that portfolio during 2014?","Jay A. Brown","Sure, Mike. On the $180 million, it includes the leasing that we would expect to happen on those AT&T sites, but it doesn't include any revenue that was on the sites when we acquired them. So it would be all organic growth during calendar year 2014, and it would be a combination of the brand-new, either leases that go on-site, the amendment to existing leases, as well as cash escalators. So it's a cash number that would be done on anything that's added to a site, it would not include anything that was acquired, if you will. In terms of our assumption on the AT&T sites relative to the rest of the portfolio, we assumed a similar level of leasing on those AT&T sites. Our assumption is that over time, as we've talked about, we think it will be growth enhancing to our site rental revenue growth rate, these new assets, because of the way they've been operated in the past. And Ben spoke about some of the early indications that we have in terms of customer desire. So we may do a little bit better than at a like level of leasing, but that was basically our assumption going into calendar year 2014. Obviously, it will take us a bit of time to get those assets completely integrated, to get them into all of our systems, to get all of the documents necessary in order to facilitate customers co-locating on these sites at the same rate at which we can typically do that on legacy Crown sites. I would tell you from past experiences, it takes us probably 6 to 8 months to kind of get most of the sites up and running to where we're operating at that level. And I'm sure there are a whole lot of our folks listening to this call this morning who are doing everything they can to make that happen faster than that, but that's the typical reality.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just a point of clarification on that. I think in your guidance commentary, you described the effect of or your expectation for $2 million of less nonrecurring revenue in 1Q '14 over 4Q '13. Can you describe to us what the nonrecurring benefit was specifically in the fourth quarter of '13?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. Typically, when we go into any -- typically, in any quarter, we have about $4 million to $5 million of items that relate to -- that are nonrecurring items that flow through site rental revenue. We have those in almost every quarter, and they relate to all kinds of things. A common example would be a tenant that had installed equipment on the site without notifying the tower operator, and that happens from time to time. So we end up collecting back rent that would be owed to us as a result of that. And so the sort of $4 million to $5 million that we always put into the expectation moving from quarter to quarter. And we had in the fourth quarter about $7 million. So we had about $2 million of, I would say, above the run rate. It's also something that we typically find after we do acquisitions. And so we might find a bit of that, but our working assumption for first quarter was we went back to kind of that normalized level. If we normalize that for the fourth quarter, maybe this is the follow-on question, if we normalize that for the fourth quarter, we kind of still came out at the high end or maybe slightly above the high end of our previously expected guide for the fourth quarter with regards to site rental revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just 2 if I could, guys. From time to time, you kind of give us a few mile markers on scoping out the size of the small cell opportunity. We've been talking about it being a strong grower, how the EBITDA has kind of doubled over the year. But if you could give us some kind of numbers to get a sense of how big a contributor it is now and kind of we can do the math on what is contributing at the margin, it would be super helpful. And then second, just, Jay, obviously, we're starting the dividend program now. There's obviously questions about how the NOLs are going to feather in through this process. You've talked about 15% dividend growth. But, on the other hand of it, I think earlier you also talked about how stock buybacks are also potentially a use of capital in your hierarchy of maximizing returns. So could you kind of put dividends now somewhere in that hierarchy? Are dividends a better way to return capital to investors or are you considering it a less good way and stock buybacks are the preferred method now?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Dave, I'll take the first on small cell. Today, it's about 5% of adjusted EBITDA, okay? Punching above its weight though. It's growing more than its proportional 5%, and that's what happens if you look at how did you grow double EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA since April of 2012. So in less than 2 years, we've doubled it. We have a lot people working very hard on co-location and new builds on the small cell networks. And as we mentioned, the fiber is obviously the very valuable asset that we have there. We spent about $180 million or so last year on that, and we expect to spend somewhat more than that. I can't tell you exactly, it obviously depends on the pipeline and the pace at which it goes. About 1\/3 of our prepaid rent or, if you will, is related to those, the construction activities around the small cell networks, that's what we've said before, and that continued in 2013. But, look, we're very pleased. This is -- it's absolutely the tower model in terms of a shared infrastructure. There's benefit to the carriers for going on the existing systems. It's a lot about speed and ease. And I hate to say ease, because these are complicated transactions to actually get constructed and built. But to the extent you've already got the dedicated fiber in the hubs, it's something where we can facilitate turning up capacity for a carrier much quicker than pretty much any other alternative in these major markets, and that's becoming quite an accepted fact. And so we're seeing the continued growth in that. And we're going to continue. We think this will continue for some time. It's a great way to add capacity in these markets, and we're very, very pleased with the business we acquired and have now grown and with the team we have dedicated to it.","Jay A. Brown","Dave, on your second question around capital allocation, as we've talked about, there are merits of increasing the dividend at a rate faster than what we've talked about of increasing it by about 15% or at least 15% per annum as we go through the process of utilizing the full extent of our taxable -- our tax net operating losses. At a pace of about 15% growth in our net operating losses, growth in dividend and against the net operating losses that would, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, exhaust the net operating losses by 2020. And I think we'll just have to see what opportunities are in front of us at the dates ahead. And to the extent that we find opportunities, either to invest in the stock or buy other assets, we may stay on that pace of 15%. To the extent that we don't see opportunities that meet our risk-adjusted returns, then we might look to increase the dividend at a pace higher than that 15%. But I think it's impossible, as we sit here today, to make the judgment about what that will look like in the future. I think if we struck the -- thought about the various balances of beginning a dividend, we thought it was an appropriate amount of a dividend, about roughly $1.40 per share in the first year out of the gate of starting the dividend, making up about 1\/3 of the cash flow, it gave us plenty of cash to continue to make opportunistic investments. We were smart, I think, about the way we thought about the capital structure and overall leverage, though as Ben mentioned earlier in his comments, we're able to continue to be competitive and look for assets that we think fit in the portfolio nicely and drive long-term returns. And at the same time, start a process of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends, which we believe gives us an opportunity to expand the investor base and start to build on a base of investors that ultimately will be a larger portion of our investor base in all likelihood. Long term, if we think about the cash flow in the business, it's likely that we'll be distributing, once the NOLs are completely exhausted, we'll likely be distributing 75% to 80% of the cash flow in the business. And obviously, that's an exciting day for us once that comes about. But in the short term, we certainly have a lot of cash and a lot of flexibility. And to the extent that there are investments there that meet the risk-adjusted returns, we're happy to make those. And if we don't see them, then we'll come back and look to return a greater percentage of the cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividend.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I could just follow up real quick on just one thing on the services revenue. You guys have been very successful with that services revenue segment. The market seems to put -- view it as a less high-quality business, and I guess most businesses are less high quality than the tower business. But I think the market struggles to figure out whether this is a bubble in this business, and it's going to pop, and this is something we need to model going back down to rates that were more reflective of the market 3 or 4 years ago, or is this a business that has just simply grown? It's a bigger business today. It's going to stay a bigger business. Crown is a bigger player in this business. How do we think about this business as a business on a go-forward basis?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. Dave, there's -- the business has certainly grown. I mean, obviously, with 4 carriers actively engaged in adding LTE and then further capacity, the business on the opportunity of the market has grown. I would quickly add, we have grown our capabilities dramatically in this area. We've added a number of resources, and we've, frankly, gotten a lot better at it, and we've expanded the scope of what we do over time. Everything from preconstruction work, zoning, permitting, all the way through managing the construction process at the end. I think each shareholder and analyst will need to come to their own conclusion about this. As we look at it, as management, strategically, it makes a lot of sense as I talked about earlier. From a valuation perspective, I think Ric's question at the beginning is very germane here. And if you want to think about it, it plateauing or even headed down over time, that's certainly everybody's purview to take a haircut if they want to and say, \"Okay, what's kind of the recurring base run rate of that activity in a more normalized market?\" I think that's certainly a logical approach. The only thing I would add to that is that it's important to then think about what's the sustaining level of G&A we would have to have, and that's somewhat of a mitigating factor as you go to start haircutting the gross margin contribution from that. Where to tell you to take that, I think I'm going to leave that for everybody to make their own best guess because obviously we're going 24\/7 around here, working on the services business. We think it drives leasing and obviously control and protection of the asset. So we're going to keep doing it, and the market can do the best they can to put a value on it, with these caveats I've mentioned around, it's important to think about the G&A component.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping you could touch on the AT&T, T-Mobile acquisitions, in particular the reserve space on the towers. If these towers are 1.6, 1.7 tenants each, and then there's reserve space, how much upside is left there? And also is this driving some of the prepaid rent? And then the other question is, with press reports talking about the market going from 4 to 3 carriers, can you remind us some of the prior consolidations and the impact they had on your business?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure. I'll take the first part. As we go through the various transactions with the most 2 recent, you mentioned with T-Mobile and AT&T, and the reserve loading or reserve capacity that they have on those towers, the way to think about that in simplistic terms is they've essentially got the reserve capacity with limitations at the current RAD center that they're operating at today. And so the historical experience, which we would expect it to play out again in the future, is over a period of about 3 years, we shouldn't expect any additional amendment revenue associated with adding equipment from those anchored carriers in the case of T-Mobile and AT&T here that we're talking about on those existing RAD centers over a period of about 3 years. After that, it's been our experience and the carriers' experience, that they exhaust that reserve capacity and they're back asking for additional capacity, whether it be on the same RAD center or a different RAD center, which is not covered by the reserve capacity, which is obviously an additional revenue opportunity. And in both of those transactions, we provided, as part of the transaction, a rate card, if you will, pricing that additional capacity and what we would charge for that. So that's part and parcel of those transactions. And our historical experience is it's about 3 years before you see them come back -- that would result in additional revenue beyond that reserve capacity. But the most important take away is it's basically limited to that existing RAD center at that level. So it doesn't encumber our ability then to co-locate additional tenants on the site, and we've been obviously very good at that over the last 14 years, and we'd expect to continue to do that.","Jay A. Brown","With regards to your second question, and I'm assuming you're referencing the recent rumors around Sprint combination with T-Mobile. We've released some of the statistics there. The overlap of those sites represent, if half of the equipment were to be removed, that would represent about 10% of our consolidated revenues today. Those leases have approximately 7 years remaining on them. So from today through when we would actually begin to see that if the combination were to happen and if sites were to begin to be taken down, we'd be about 7 years from now to that date. I think our typical experience has been and you can certainly rewind the clock and look at the timing of when Sprint acquired the Nextel network and the iDEN network, we're just now experiencing that many years later, well beyond the 7-year timeline. So a lot -- there's a lot of variables. I think our experience has been a relatively small amount of churn that we ultimately see in consolidation. And I think the broader point, which we have talked extensively about over the years about the consolidations is that the best thing for us as a tower company is to have carriers that have spectrum and have significant cash flow and strong financial position. And to the extent that they are able to deliver strong financial returns from incremental investment in capital and are not susceptible to changes in the market in order to raise that capital for investment, we do very well as a tower business. And Ben spoke to one of the earlier questions around spectrum and the long-term prospects of additional spectrum being in the hands of the operators and having carriers that are in a strong financial position, I think net-net, over the years, consolidation has been a very good thing for our industry. And while the churn conversation in the sites lost, we certainly have reconciled that on the positive side in terms of what it meant around revenue growth and additional revenues that we receive on sites today, that -- we believe that number far outweighs any of the downside that we've seen from the loss of some of the churn that has happened over time.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Bowen from Pacific Crest.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. I wanted to get one point of clarification. With T-Mobile and Sprint builds, did you say you do have some of the 4G LTE builds for them built into the guidance or not? Second question around the EBITDA increase in '14 or the adjusted EBITDA increase in '14, sorry if I missed it, wanted to see where that was coming from. And then on small cells finally, do you view this activity as sustainable over the years or do you think this is a near-term spike over the next couple of years as the carriers densify their networks?","Jay A. Brown","Yes. I think in terms of your first question around T-Mobile and Sprint build, our leasing activity assumes that we'll see good lease-up activity across the board from all of the carriers. If I'm understanding your question correctly, you're speaking to the lease-up and not necessarily the construction of new towers. We're building very few brand-new towers across the portfolio, but we are assuming that we'll see lease-up and additional leasing activity from T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon and AT&T. And they make up the vast majority of our revenue growth expectation.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And real quickly with that, does that include the -- any assumptions for the 700 MHz A Block that T-Mobile [indiscernible]?","Jay A. Brown","I think that to the extent something happens there, that will likely be beyond calendar year 2014 in terms of what we would see impacting our results. So I would say maybe you'd see some of that in terms of lease activity as we go towards the end of the year, but I don't think that would be a meaningful contributor to the site rental revenues in the calendar year. On the second question around adjusted EBITDA increase, we did increase our assumption by approximately $20 million. Most of that is coming from the services expectation, increasing our services expectation for 2014 from where we had previously issued the guidance. We did take up the low end of the range on site rental revenue and site rental gross margin. So there is $2 million to $3 million of higher contribution from the site rental revenue and site rental gross margin in terms of that increase in that $20 million increase in adjusted EBITDA. So it's about $17 million or so from services, and then the balance coming from site rental.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Your last question on the sustainability of the small cell network, we certainly believe it is sustainable. We're signing long-term agreements just as we are in the tower -- on the tower side, and we have a vast market out there of capacity challenged, high sort of urban dense-type markets. It's only continuing to get more and more challenged as we all put more devices on these networks. So we certainly think this is a very long-term phenomenon, and these are permanent installations.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And are those contract terms as long as the other contracts?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. Yes. Looks very similar. We have time for one more, I think. Probably ran overtime a little bit today.","Operator","So your final question will come from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Your guidance for site rental revenue implies about a $473 million increase off of the actuals in 2013. And when I go through the different components, I'm just having a little trouble figuring it out. So you're assuming $175 million to $185 million. I've got $180 million, about half of that for escalators, about half for new leases, which includes amendments. And then I think you've told us in the past that AT&T is going to generate about $400 million of revenue. So that's $580 million and then if I was to subtract out $50 million for the churn, I get back down to $530 million. So I'm just trying to figure out what the delta is between the $473 million and the $530 million. I think it has to do with GAAP versus cash revenue, but I was hoping you could give a little bit more color on that. And then I have one other question after that.","Jay A. Brown","Sure. You have correctly identified the GAAP there. It is related to the -- how we book and are required to book under the accounting terms our lease portfolio. So most -- the vast majority of our tenant leases that are on our towers have fixed escalators. The rate is stated in terms of 3%, 4%, et cetera, and we straight line over the term of the lease, the revenue. So in a simple example, if a lease had -- was $100 and had a 5% escalator for a 2-year period of time. In the first year, cash would be $100, in the second year cash would be $105. So cash would have grown by 5 year-over-year. But from a presentation in our financial statement, it would look like site rental revenues of $102.5 for each of the 2 years. In the first year...","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So of the $180 million, roughly $90 million for escalators, and the majority of the delta between the $470 million and the $530 million is in that aspect of the number?","Jay A. Brown","That's exactly right, Colby. Almost all of the $90 million, almost all of the $90 million would already, in essence, already be straight-lined through the site rental revenue number.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned 30% new lease revenue growth, and you mentioned on the third quarter call and you called that out today. Is that simply to take the $90 million of new leases and I guess that was $70 million roughly in '13, and now it's $90 million, and that equates to roughly 30% growth. Is that, when you say 30% growth, the absolute numbers that you're referencing?","Jay A. Brown","You're mostly there. The one thing I would add is that we're doing this on a same-tower basis. So you can't take the absolute nominal dollars, which we're going to benefit by owning nearly another 10,000 assets as a result of our AT&T tower transaction. So we're looking at it on a site-by-site basis and basically saying the amount of additional revenue we'll add from adding additional tenants to towers on a same-store basis or same-tower basis, that number is up 30% year-over-year.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up -- my quick follow-up question was, you noted $18 million of revenue for the AT&T towers in the fourth quarter. That's roughly 15 days. And if I simply divide that out and then multiply that by 365, it actually implies on an annualized basis, that for those 18 days, the AT&T towers generated $438 million of revenue versus your guidance of roughly $400 million. Could you just explain to me why I might be off or why I shouldn't be assuming a much greater number for AT&T revenue in 2014?","Jay A. Brown","Yes. It does imply, if you look at -- I would point you more towards the site rental gross margin, because there will be some impact in terms of, as we talked about it when we gave the guidance, we were referring to what the cash flow, cash benefit was from the AT&T towers. And it certainly appears based on our early review that we may have been a bit conservative as we underwrote the assets in terms of our assumption of what run rate cash flows coming off of those assets are. So we may have some -- we may have gained some benefit on that given our conservative assumptions as we underwrote the asset.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And does the guidance still assume that conservative assumption or if you have -- or have you adjusted that?","Jay A. Brown","We have not adjusted that.","W. Benjamin Moreland","All right. I think we're going to wrap up. I appreciate everybody hanging with us a little long today as we did a full year wrap up and acquisition and quarter discussions, and look forward to having a great year in 2014 and reporting to you on more of our successes. So thanks, and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ben Lowe. Please go ahead, sir.","Ben Lowe","Great. Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter 2018 results. With me on the call this morning are Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. To aid the discussion, we've posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we'll refer to throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and any actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors sections of the company's SEC filings. Our statements are made as of today, January 24, 2019, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","In addition, today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investors section of the Company's website at crowncastle.com.","So, with that, let me turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Brown","Thanks Ben, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call.","As you saw from our results, we've kept off another year of growth with solid fourth quarter results. As I look forward, I'm optimistic the positive trends we see in the market will drive demand for our communications infrastructure assets. And I believe Crown Castle is well positioned to take advantage of those trends and deliver growth and returns for shareholders for years to come.","Through disciplined capital allocation and execution, we have established an unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers and 65,000 route miles of high capacity fiber in the top U.S. markets, where we see the greatest long-term growth and opportunity.","On this call, there are three important themes I want to discuss. First, 2018 was a successful year for Crown Castle. Secondly, our strategy of offering towers to small cells and fiber solutions is delivering the results we expected. And third, I'm excited about the long runway of growth as 4G investment remains robust and the deployment of 5G infrastructure is just getting started.","On the first point, we delivered 10% growth in dividends per share in 2018, supported by cash flow growth across both our tower and fiber assets. Tower leasing increased in the back half of the year as all of our major customers' were actively investing in the network by deploying new cell sites and additional spectrum.","Further, highlighting the strong demand for our infrastructure, we deployed a record number of small cells during 2018. In addition to the great operational performance in small cells, we added significantly more small cell nodes to our backlog than we installed in 2018. Meaning, we have a larger contracted pipeline of small cells to build today than we did at this time last year.","Importantly, our team delivered these results while integrating our recent fiber acquisitions. With the integration work substantially complete, I'm excited as I look ahead and see the potential growth opportunity as we focus on adding both small cell and fiber solutions customers to our 65,000 route miles of dense, high capacity fiber.","This brings me to my second point: our unique strategy of offering towers, small cells and fiber solutions which are all critical components of communication networks that can be shared across multiple customers is delivering the results we expected.","With the volume of data delivered by both wireless and wired networks growing rapidly, our customers are leasing access to our tower and fiber assets to increase the capacity of their networks and keep pace with that growth.","Because we have the ability to share our assets across multiple customers, we can provide our customers with cost-effective assets to the critical infrastructure they need, while generating significant value for our shareholders over time as we lease our assets and drive cash flow growth.","Steady performance and consistent execution over the last two decades has proven that providing shared infrastructure assets in the U.S. is a great business. Over that time frame, we've invested approximately $23 billion in tower assets and continue to create tremendous value for our shareholders as we grow the cash flows and returns on those investments by adding tenants.","Since 2001, we've increased site rental revenues in our tower business at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 14%, scaling the business from approximately $350 million in annual revenue in 2001 to more than $3 billion in 2018.","In recent years, we've expanded our infrastructure offering beyond towers by investing approximately $13 billion to establish fiber footprints in prime locations across the top U.S. markets where we see the greatest long-term demand. Our fiber investments are already yielding 8% and have significant available capacity to add new small cells and fiber solutions.","As you can see in our 2019 outlook, we are seeing increasing levels of demand for our fiber assets. Following a record year in 2018 in terms of the number of small cells we deployed, we expect to nearly double our production this year by deploying 10,000 to 15,000 nodes.","In addition, we have approximately 20,000 additional nodes in the pipeline that we expect to deploy in 2020 and beyond. Since it typically takes about 18 to 24 months for contracted nodes to be put on air and start generating revenue, we have a line of sight into meaningful small cell revenue growth beyond 2019.","With respect to towers, we expect the higher new leasing activity we saw in the back half of 2018 to continue, resulting in a meaningful acceleration in tower new leasing in 2019 as compared to 2018.","With higher levels of new leasing activity across towers and small cells and steady growth from our fiber solutions business, I'm excited about our opportunity to continue to translate revenue growth into anticipated long-term growth in dividends per share of 7% to 8% per year, which brings me to my third and final point.","I see a long runway of growth in front of Crown Castle as our customers continue to invest heavily in their 4G networks to keep pace with data demand growth from existing technologies, while the deployment of 5G is just getting started.","According to the latest estimates from Cisco, mobile data traffic in the U.S. is expected to grow five-fold from 2017 through 2022. To put that growth into perspective, that means mobile data traffic in 2022 is expected to be equal to 12 times the volume of all Internet traffic in the U.S. in 2005.","While the sheer scale of the expected growth is staggering and should drive significant demand for our infrastructure assets, I get even more excited when I consider how early we are in the digital transformation of the U.S. economy and the critical role mobile infrastructure will play.","I think we're just scratching the surface when you consider mobile traffic is expected to account for just 6% of total IT traffic in the U.S. in 2022, up from 3% a couple of years ago. While we continue to underwrite our investments based on existing applications and existing technologies, we believe the network infrastructure needed to support the next generation services will dramatically increase the demand for our tower and fiber assets. The journey from first generation mobile technology through 4G has changed the way we as consumers, live and work.","What I find really intriguing about 5G and some of the emerging technologies is that they have the potential to fundamentally alter the role of wireless networks, going from connecting over 300 million people in the U.S. to potentially connecting billions of devices in the future.","Some of those emerging technologies include autonomous cars augmented to virtual reality and industrial applications that require networks to provide availability anywhere at any time and on any device.","To meet those requirements at the speeds and latency that will be necessary, industry estimates predict that carriers will need to achieve a ten-fold increase in network performance as measured by latency, reliability and speed.","From an infrastructure perspective that will require the deployment of additional spectrum across more cell sites both on towers and on small cells for decades to come. And we believe Crown Castle is in a great position at the center of these megatrends with our unmatched portfolio of towers and high-capacity natural fiber assets.","Given these long-term opportunities, we are investing in assets we believe will attract and generate long-term returns for shareholders, while paying a high quality dividend that we expect to be able to grow somewhere between 7% and 8% on an annual basis.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schlanger","Thanks Jay, and good morning, everyone.","As Jay mentioned, we closed 2018 with solid fourth quarter results, completing another very successful year for Crown Castle in several fronts. We increased dividends per share by 10%, consistent with our growth in AFFO per share and our commitment to return capital to shareholders.","We substantially completed the integration of our recent fiber acquisitions and made significant investments in new fiber assets across the top markets, where we see the greatest demand for small cells and fiber solutions. And we made those investments, while improving our overall financial flexibility by proactively refinancing upcoming maturities and increasing the average majority of our debt.","Turning first to the fourth quarter 2018 results on Slide 4, I'm going to walk through a few items that should be considered when comparing the results to our prior outlook. First, site rental revenues exceeded the midpoint of the prior range by approximately $15 million, including $10 million of additional straight-lined revenues, primarily resulting from the term extensions associated with leasing activity.","In addition, there are approximately $10 million of higher costs associated with the combination of additional incentive accruals for 2018 and the expenses associated with certain natural disasters that occurred during the quarter.","The results were also impacted by approximately $5 million of lower services contribution that is timing-related. So we now expect that contribution in 2019. And finally, AFFO benefited by approximately $10 million from lower sustaining capital expenditures in the quarter, a portion of which are expected to now occur in 2019.","Adjusting for the total impact of these items, results were within the ranges provided in our prior outlook for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO. For the full year 2018, site rental revenues increased approximately 29% or $1.05 billion including approximately 5.6% growth in organic contribution to site rental revenues.","Moving on to investment activities during the year, we deployed approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures including $1.6 billion of revenue-generating capital expenditures comprised of $1.2 billion in fiber and approximately $350 million for towers.","For the full year 2019, we expect gross CapEx of approximately $2 billion or approximately $1.5 billion net of prepaid rent. Based on our expected cash flow growth and the incremental leverage capacity that growth will create, we believe we can finance this level of spending without issuing equity.","Supporting this belief, we ended 2018 at just over five times debt-to-EBITDA, consistent with our intent to finance the business with approximately five turns of leverage as we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. Additionally, with more than $3 billion of available capacity on our revolver and no maturities until 2021, we're comfortable with our debt balance sheet flexibility.","Turning now to Slide 5 of the presentation, at the midpoints, we increased our full year 2019 outlook for site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA by approximately $40 million due to higher straight-lined revenues, primarily resulting from the term extensions associated with leasing activity that I mentioned earlier. As you can see, AFFO guidance remains unchanged at approximately $5.85 per share as the higher straight-lined revenue does not contribute to AFFO.","Turning to Slide 6, we now expect between $223 million and $268 million of growth in site rental revenues in 2019. As you can see in the chart on the Slide, when compared to the prior outlook, the only change relates to the impact of the higher straight-lined revenues I just discussed.","Our expectations for growth in organic contribution to site rental revenues remain unchanged at approximately 6%, up from 5.6% in 2018. We continue to expect higher 2019 new leasing activity for both towers and small cells with consistent levels of growth from fiber solutions.","To wrap-up, 2018 was another very successful year for Crown Castle and we're excited about the anticipated growth in our business in 2019. Currently, we are seeing the benefits from the investments our customers are making in wireless networks to keep pace with increasing data demand, which allows us to provide near-term returns through a high quality dividend that we expect to grow 7% to 8% annually.","At the same time, we're making significant investments in our small cell and fiber business that we believe will position Crown Castle to take advantage of the long-term growth trends Jay discussed earlier.","Because we are still early in the growth cycle for small cells, we believe our investments will provide significant long-term upside as we add tenants to those new assets. It is this combination of near-term returns and expected long-term upside that I think makes Crown Castle such an attractive investment.","And with that Brian, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now take your first question from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Simon Flannery","Coming back down to your comments around the balance sheet, could you just talk a little bit more about the use of leverage versus equity? So what are you comfortable with in terms of taking the leverage from where it is today? What's that upper end of that range?","And then is there something that you might amend if say you were looking at some M&A? Maybe if you could just comment more broadly on any M&A opportunities that you might be considering? Thanks.","Dan Schlanger","As we've discussed a lot in the past what we look at is we want to maintain an investment grade credit profile, which we believe means we need to stay at five times debt-to-EBITDA which is our target leverage.","We've been right around there. We ended the year right around there, right at five times just north of it, and so when we look out and see what our expected capital spend is over the course of 2019 and the incremental EBITDA that we believe we will generate and the leverage capacity it will create, we think that we're going to be able to use that leverage capacity in our internally generated cash flow to pay for the capital expenditures and maintain around five times debt-to-EBITDA.","So that's why we think that we're in a position where we don't need equity. From what we can tell right now, we don't need equity through 2019 based on what we see the capital spend profile to be.","To your point though, if we do see some M&A activity out and think that's something that's attractive for us, that would be external to what we just talked about. That would be funded in a way that would be consistent with maintaining our investment grade rating and five times leverage, and would likely include equity because I think we're going to buy whatever company or assets we would buy it would be for more than five times.","So it would include some equity at that point. But when we're talking about our capital program from 2019, we feel pretty good about our ability to finance it.","Jay Brown","Simon, more broadly on the M&A front, we've talked about this I think the last several quarters on the call. We really don't see opportunities in the market of large scale that are going to fit our strategy, our focus around earning metro fiber that's dense with high capacity and believe the more likely approach for us is going to be to invest to be a building ourselves organic build.","There may be some tuck-in acquisitions in some markets where we find an opportunity where it makes sense to buy it versus build it, but we think the more likely outcome is that we're going to be building fiber to meet the demand that we see coming for small cells.","Simon Flannery","And it limited interest internationally?","Jay Brown","Yes. We continue to believe the U.S. market is the best market in the world for the investment in communications infrastructure. We're always open to learning and seeing what else is going on in the world. But based on everything we've had the opportunity to see thus far we think the best opportunity for returns exist here in the U.S. it continues to be the largest and fastest growing market in the world.","And to my comments that I made around 5G, we certainly believe the U.S. is going to lead the way on 5G in the amount of capital investments here and the potential opportunities we think are the greatest here in the U.S.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David Barden","I guess, one follow-up on that, Dan. Just when you guys gave guidance last quarter with the interest expense that you built in, it was clear that the debt funding was going to be the lead vehicle for financing the business.","So can you give us any more color now in terms of what you're thinking in whether it's a revolver or debt unsecured or secured and kind of the timing as we think about kind of the numbers flowing through in the year?","And then the second one is, could you guys share any kind of incremental color on the tenant extension that you kind of announced with the source of kind of the guidance raise this quarter?","When I look at the supplement on page 18, it's really hard to see that anything really changed there at all? So it wasn't clear kind of what the moving part there was will be helpful. Thank you.","Dan Schlanger","Sure. I'll take the first one Dave, and thanks for the question. When we put together the guidance as you pointed out, we had assumptions around how we would finance the business and through 2019, and nothing has significantly changed in the way we think about that. We clarified just now on the equity point but nothing has changed on how we think about financing our business.","What we're trying to do is maintain our investment grade credit profile and do it at the lowest cost we possibly can. And when we look out and see what the market looks like in terms of trying to term out debt or what our revolver capacity is, we feel good about the flexibility we have on our balance sheet and we'll just be opportunistic as we look out and see when it makes sense to try to turn things out to the extent that we want to between secured and unsecured and anything - any other funding source we could possibly get our hands on because we want to be open to everything.","Jay Brown","Dave to your second question, we did not do a new - as people would often term it a new deal during the quarter. So what we're speaking to and the adjustment that we made to the outlook doesn't have to do anything with something new that we crafted a new deal with customers.","It was just related to the activity that we saw and then the term of the leases on those - on that leasing activity. So as you know we're hesitant to get into the specifics of how we transact with customers but that's what's driving the reference in both the press release and in the numbers.","David Barden","So this wasn't something new. And it was not a term extension that got signed in the quarter?","Jay Brown","It was not a new deal that we did no. It would be term related to the leasing activity that we saw during the quarter.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ric Prentiss","Appreciate for taking the question. Two quick ones. Dan you mentioned in your prepared remarks the CapEx, the 1.7 billion in 2018 and then in 2019 2 billion gross, 1.5 billion net. The 2018 number, is that 1.7 billion, is that a gross number or the net number?","Dan Schlanger","That's a gross number, the 1.7.","Ric Prentiss","Okay. So the 1.7 we compared with the 2.0 gross in 2019.","Dan Schlanger","Yes.","Ric Prentiss","And then following on Dave's question on page 18 of the supplement, the one thing we noticed was - I know you don't like to talk specific but the numbers that are out there that I think T-Mobile 2022 annual rent, cash payments at renewal went from 560 to 510 in 2022. Is that part of what we're seeing that as some of that renewal timeframe got extended out beyond 2022?","Dan Schlanger","Ric I don't want to tie components of what we've given together but you're correctly reading the supplement to see that the term for components of revenues that were in earlier periods are getting pushed out to later dates. I would be careful about drawing too many connections between the numbers. But as you read the supplement on the face of the supplement you're accurate that term has been extended.","Ric Prentiss","And the average life I think did come down for Sprint from seven years to six years, all the other guys stayed at their previous number is that just that we've rolled off another year and if somebody stays at five years or six years that there's been some extension? I'm just trying to think how should we read the supplement kind of year-to-year and what happens to the remaining life?","Jay Brown","Yes, I think the way you described it is a good way to think about as we've just crossed over the year. And so depending on what the terms of given contracts are absent activity on a site and you're going to see those come closer to zero. And to the extent that there is activity or new leasing activity it's going to move the book out towards the right.","Dan Schlanger","The only thing I would mention Ric is that maybe to clarify the point you made is because they're whole numbers, there's rounding there too. So, the fact that one stays at five from one period to the next period it doesn't mean that we extended it. It just means that it hadn't crossed over from a rounding perspective.","Ric Prentiss","Makes sense. And we haven't heard any comments from you guys on DISH, but it does feel like other people are starting to see DISH show up. Has that been helping the benefits? Have you seen some movement from DISH on putting their narrowband IoT network out there?","Jay Brown","As you know we don't like to comment specifically on individual customers. I would tell you outside of the Big 4 that there is spectrum that's being deployed for a number of different uses and that is helping our revenue growth results and we think there's opportunity for more of that in the future.","The majority of the revenue growth that we see both on towers and small cells is really being driven by the Big 4 operators. But beyond that the infrastructure is useful for anyone who wants to deploy a wireless network and we're seeing demand from a number of customers outside of the Big 4.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Brett Feldman from Goodman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. You were talking about the increasing pace of small cell no deployment going from 10,000 to 15,000 up to 20,000. And what we've seen in the past is that as you've ramped up your capacity to deploy small cells, there has been some increase in your operating expenses.","I was hoping maybe you could just explain that dynamic to us. Are you at a point right now where there's some type of a linear relationship, meaning if you'll increase your deployment pace by 1,000 nodes or so, there's going to be a certain amount of increase in your expense?","Are you beginning to hit a point where there's an increasing degree of operating leverage within the business that as you scale your growth, you may be start to see more conversion of that revenue towards the bottom-line?","Jay Brown","Yes, Brett I would say based on what we have in the backlog currently that we're working on both for 2019 and the work that we're already beginning on nodes that will go on air in 2020 and beyond, we think that our operating structure as is currently situated is sufficient to manage that growth.","To the extent that the pipeline growth even larger or we're trying to put on air more than - as I mentioned in my comments, trying to get on air somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 nodes in 2019. If we were to meaningfully raise that number beyond that, then we'd have to come back and talk about what we think the cost structure is appropriate.","If it were to get to that things that would matter in that analysis is how many new markets are we having to go towards. To the extent that the increase with end markets that we exist in, it might have less of an impact towards rising cost.","If we see the opportunity expanding beyond existing markets, then that would have a different calculus in terms of thinking about operating expenses. But I think the right way to look at it now is for the pipeline that we have currently contracted, we think the operating expenses are a stable level of activity to handle that level of demand.","Brett Feldman","You mind if I ask a quick follow-up. As we think about the bottleneck in your ability to deploy at any given pace, what would you say it is? Is it the absolute level of demand for small cell deployments? Is it your own capacity to meet that demand? Or is it external factors like the zoning process?","Dan Schlanger","Well, in terms of timing, obviously, as we talk about the timeline to deploy this 18 months to 24 months to get them deployed we could - if we were to see an increase in the amount of nodes that we're contracting today, we'd be two years away from actually benefiting from the revenue associated with that.","So in terms of financial results, I think the biggest bottleneck I would point to is the amount of time it takes to get these deployed. The regulatory hurdles to get there are significant and the FCC has obviously helped us through their recent order and it gives some clarity around what the nature of the deployment should good look like and it gets us to the path towards working with communities in order to get something in place. But nonetheless, the hurdles are there and the timeline is significant. So that's probably the biggest bottleneck.","Obviously, we think based on everything that we know and what we're seeing around 5G, we think the opportunities for small cells is very likely to increase over time. And so to the extent that the overall demand for small cells increase that is certainly a gating item currently in terms of what the cap on what our opportunity is. And over time we think the opportunity is going to grow. But specific to financial results, it would be the timeline currently that it takes between when it's contracted and when we can get it on air.","Jay Brown","And the only thing I would add to that Brett, I don't think it's our internal capability or capacity that is a bottleneck at all. We've been able to scale, as Jay was talking about in an answer the first question you asked, from 5,000 nodes or so a few years ago to 10,000 to 15,000 nodes now do you think we can continue to scale. It's really the combination of how big that demand will be ultimately in the time it takes to get there.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jon Atkin from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jon Atkin","So I was interested the natural disaster reference what specifically were you referring to? And is there any sort of continued impact into 1Q?","Jay Brown","We don't expect there will be any flow-through to Q1. Specifically, what we're referring to was Hurricane Michael in Puerto Rico and then the significant fire that happened in Southern California.","Jon Atkin","And then during the script you mentioned the word latency. So that made me think about Vapor IO. I'm wondering if you could kind of provide any update operationally and potentially financially what we can kind of expect over the next year or so.","Jay Brown","We're continuing to do some work on edge computing. As the networks get designed and traffic increases to my comments around, where traffic is increasing on mobile networks, we continue to believe that some of the traffic in order to get to the latency required for Internet-of-Things, some portion of the network is going to have to be designed where information is kept at the very edge of the network, some for cost purposes, but also for reduction in latency. And we believe that it makes a lot of sense for a meaningful portion of that edge compute to be put in places where there are existing macro sites connected to small cells.","So we're continuing to do a number of trials there. But it's still very early and you shouldn't expect to see any impact to our financial results certainly not in 2019 and the outlook that we've given from the work that we're doing there. But long-term, it could be an opportunity. It may result in us having another use for leasing our sites whether it's the ground or space on the towers related to edge compute.","Jon Atkin","And then finally, I was wondering, if you could comment on the organic growth rate within fiber exclusive of small cells, so enterprise fiber essentially?","Dan Schlanger","What we're looking at is about mid-single-digit growth rate on the revenue basis for the fiber solutions business exclusive of small cells. Small cells growth we think is going to be closer to 20% range and that's comprised in the fiber solutions business. That's net of high-single digits of churn. So the overall growth we think we'll get there is around 5%.","Operator","We will now take our next question Colby Synesael from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Colby Synesael","You've historically talked about expanding the number of markets where you see the small cell opportunity. I was wondering if you can give us color on what that looks like today and how many of those markets do you have fiber in at this point versus you'll need to get there? And those markets that you don't have fiber, is it about organically building or is it more like that you'd do those tuck-ins that you described?","And then secondly, when would you expect to see massive MIMO type of equipment start to get put up on towers? Based on the conversations that you're having with your customers, is that something that you're starting to happen in 2019 in a material way or is that still out there? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Yes, Colby to your first question the vast majority of the spend by the wireless operators for small cells continues to be in the top 30 markets in the U.S. so basically the NFL cities. And we have fiber plant in many if not all of those markets now or we're in the process of constructing it.","To the extent that the expansion goes beyond those top 30 markets, which we're doing some of that, but it's not a meaningful amount of capital or frankly a meaningful amount of small cells yet, so that's where the opportunity is currently. And that would stands for both the pipeline of nodes that we're deploying and we'll put on air in 2019 as well as our contracted backlog at this point is mostly focused on those top 30 markets.","As I mentioned earlier, my comments around the M&A I intended those to be more broad than just the markets that we're currently working in. As we look at markets even beyond the top 30, we don't see acquisitions as a likely outcome for any meaningful amount of the fiber that we may want to own. We think it's more likely that we're going to end up having to build it. And that's a result of us assessing the type of fiber that exists in the market.","We just don't see the dense high-capacity urban fiber in markets whether we're talking about top 30 or beyond the top 30 that are likely targets of any meaningful size to us, we think we're much more likely to be more organically building that fiber.","On your second question around MIMO and tenants, we are seeing some of that, but I don't know that that's - frankly that relevant ultimately to our investment story. As carriers deploy equipment on the small cells and on towers in order to deploy network and manage both their spectrum position and capacity needs.","They do a number of different things with the antennas in order to meet that. And in order to design the network, there are a lot of demographic characteristics that are going to fall into that analysis.","The relevance for us is much more around - is there need for it and then how are they designing the network. We are seeing some of the massive MIMO antennas being deployed, but I don't know that that's really a meaningful component of our investment story. I would look much more at just the overall activity and the deployment of network and the carriers will make different choices around how they deploy that network depending on the demographics.","Colby Synesael","I think for the lower band spectrum, massive MIMO will require significant pieces of equipment. Some people will say like the size of a small dorm room type or refrigerator. And as a result of that just considering the size of that there's a viewpoint that that could by itself be a material driver to growth for the tower operators when that happens. I guess your point is that we shouldn't isolate that as a material revenue opportunity is that what I'm hearing?","Jay Brown","Exactly, because they could solve the same thing by using more sites or different types of equipment depending on what spectrum bands they use and how they choose to do it. So just in isolation, I wouldn't necessarily assume that would be a large revenue driver for us.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Matthew Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matthew Niknam","Thank you for taking the question. It's on light towers. So I guess it's about a year now or over a year since you closed that deal. Can you just update us on some of the revenue synergies you are talking about for both CCI's existing enterprise and fiber assets to leverage the Lightower network and then obviously your ability to add new small cell revenue on that existing fiber?","And then on the cost side, I know there wasn't much that you'd outlined in the way of cost synergies. But is there anything to think about now that you've fully integrated the asset on a go-forward basis having multiple fiber assets under CCI's ownership? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Sure. When you're into the Lightower acquisition things have gone basically as we expected. So we've been pleased with how things have gone the first year into ownership. We, as part of the acquisition have the benefit of attracting about 900 employees that came with it and they have been terrific, very seasoned, great skills and haven't done a good job continue to run that business and have been an integral part of the integration of the other fiber assets that we had acquired previously.","I'm pleased today that we've effectively completed almost all of the integration activities and have everything on a common system. So excited about what's that going to mean for us with regards to revenue synergies.","When we announced that transaction and as we look today, there are a number of nodes that are going on existing fiber and some of the fiber that we acquired we were down the road on already contracting the nodes. And so we're using the fiber that we acquired to handle some of those nodes.","And given the markets that we acquired mostly in the Northeast Lightower and in the two Texas markets that regard with FiberNet, there is a significant amount of opportunity in those markets for small cells. So we're really early days in terms of the deployment of small cells against the fiber that we've owned, but the pieces is playing out as we would've expected 12 months into it.","Dan Schlanger","From the second part of the cost synergy standpoint, what we're talking about is what we meant we thought - as Jay said, we breakup 900 people and knew what they're doing and we've kept - we've kept the vast majority of those people and we're not looking to try to bring out cost synergies to try to make sure we're operating that any differently than it has been operated in the past. What we're looking to is trying to expand our market.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Nick Del Deo","I realized that it might be a challenging question to answer just given the very nature of fiber. But can you try to give us a sense for what share of your purpose-built small cell systems are also generating some sort of revenue from non-small cell source like an enterprise customer or perhaps what share do you sell a few years after they were constructed?","Jay Brown","I don't know that I have a number of the top off my head Nick, to be able to answer that - answer that question for you. As we look at individual markets which is - we tend more to look at the business on as we study how have we done in particular markets when we talked about some of these case studies in the past, we'll do a deep dive in a market like Chicago or New York and look at what was our initial investment, how much fiber did we own initially, what was the nature of that initial fiber relationship whether it was K-12 or enterprise or small cells and then watch it develop over time.","And as we look at individual case studies what we've seen if the thesis has played out as we expected. When you own fiber in areas where there's a dense population of people those are the places where the wireless networks are challenged and they need to add capacity and so we see those fiber networks. Whether we start with small cells or we start with a fiber solutions application, we see overtime it being an asset that's shared and we find that in areas that are dense, urban, downtown business districts.","And then we find it in more suburban applications. In both situations, the fiber ends up, where the people are, the fiber ends up being needed for business enterprise hospitals universities, schools and being necessary for wireless.","Dan Schlanger","And one of the good things about the strategy we've deployed is - and why we're so interested in the fiber we're interested is having lots of strengths high-capacity fiber and lots of density really plays into all of that. So having the ability to serve all those markets at the same time with the level of service that isn't necessarily available in the market because the fiber is so unique just that the capacity we have is unique through most - through a lot of that positions us really well to take advantage of all the markets we can serve.","Nick Del Deo","And then Jay in your prepared remarks you talked about expected wireless traffic growth and how that drives your outlook for your wireless infrastructure and historically with towers exclusive nature of the assets in the physics of wireless deliveries meant just to be of pretty strong linkage between attractive growth and monetization rates, when I think about fiber solutions that relationship doesn't seem quite as clear given ongoing improvements in Medtronics and there being more competition. So with respect to fiber solutions, specifically, how do you think about the long-term relationship between traffic growth and revenue growth?","Jay Brown","Nick appreciate that question because I think there is a sense in which that question drives towards the heart of our strategy of all the IP traffic that's out there, Internet traffic that's out there, is not the target of our business. And so there's a significant portion of that traffic that we don't serve today, a significant portion of it that we wouldn't ever aim to serve.","The portion of the market that we're aiming for is large enterprises, universities, hospitals, in some cases government systems that are large users most of the time a few multi-location businesses.","And that's really our only - that's our target for providing fiber solutions where really all we're providing is the pipe and the pipe happens to run along places where because of the demographics of an area, there's going to be a lot of users in mobile technology there and constraints on the network and therefore that fiber is going to be needed for small cells.","So I think overall traffic is indicative to some degree of the opportunity that's in front of us with those large enterprises, hospitals, universities, et cetera. But I would not try to take our fiber solutions business and draw a direct connection to overall growth in Internet or IP traffic over time as a direct correlation to what our revenue growth in our fiber solutions business is.","I do think of the mobile side, which is why I made the comments that I made, I do think that on the mobile side that that traffic is a good indication of the necessity of improvement in network particularly with regard to the uses of that network.","As latency comes down, not only is it latency a concern, but reliability has to go up pretty meaningfully from where the wireless networks start today in order for the devices that are likely to be used in the 5G environment to actually be effective and be able to be relied upon for industrial uses.","And that increase and the reliability of the networks and the reduction in latency is going to mean a pretty significant increase we believe in a number of places where there's deployment of wireless spectrum both on towers and small cells. So to wireless traffic, I think, it's a pretty good indication on the total traffic side or wire side probably not the best indication for our business.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Adam Ilkowitz","This is Adam Ilkowitz on for Mike. I was curious about the site leasing growth in the fourth quarter came in a little bit above what we're expecting.","I was wondering if you can give a reason for what drove that, and maybe why didn't flow through the 2019 guidance that wasn't updated for organic? Thank you.","Dan Schlanger","The driver of the most of that incremental activity was actually our small cell business where we saw the activity levels a little higher than what we expected going into the quarter. And the reason it didn't roll through is because we've given ranges around what we think 2019 will be and this is all within those ranges.","So we don't anticipate updating guidance every time something moves by a couple million dollars. We're trying to make it where the range is incorporate what we think is a reasonable expectation of the potential outcomes and this falls within that range. So we're not going to update it for that.","Adam Ilkowitz","And then just a follow-on. The small cell business and the tower business given that a lot of customers are overlapping, can you talk about what type of relationships those two businesses are having in the sales process?","Are you signing joint contracts for both products? Or are your customers continuing to think about those products in areas that are addressing separately? Thank you.","Jay Brown","On the carrier side, the individuals who are deploying network would be handling both towers and small cells. So we don't see separate groups that we're having those conversations with. They're very different conversations though in terms of as we think about value.","On the small cells side, we're deploying a significant amount of capital generally speaking about 75% of the activity that we have or thereabouts is going to be related to anchor activity and the balance would be colo.","So in that 70%, 70%, 75% of the total activity being anchor activity we're deploying significant amount of capital in order to build those systems. So the conversation on that front is around the yield and return on that invested capital.","As we've talked about before, we would expect in order to deploy capital somewhere in the neighborhood of a 6% to 7% initial yield and then ultimately we get to a return to justify the investments and an acceptable return ultimately to the shareholder of adding multiple tenants beyond that. So our evaluation on the small cells side comes down to what's the investment required and what do we think the potential return is based on location and other things.","On the tower side, it's a different conversation. It's around what assets exist in the market that will need or solve the needs that they have. And there because of the agreements that we would have with all the customers, we're not really doing an analysis around what the return on a per-dollar basis is for the investment of capital because the capital investment has already been made.","So it's a conversation that happens with the same people, but it's a very different conversation depending on the type of product that they're trying to buy from us.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Walter Piecyk from BTIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Walter Piecyk","I just want to ask obviously again about the prepaid my favorite question. It looks like for the year, you were guiding to 35 to 40. It was at the minimum of the high end maybe over. Can you talk about what were the issues there?","And then for next year, you had talked about doing 35 to 40. What's on top of this year? What's the increase? Is the baseline for that is at 3.27 million that's reported? Or is the baseline the 2.92 million or maybe lower that excludes the acquired prepaid for the quarter? Thanks.","Dan Schlanger","Sure, Walt. So first, yes the prepaid came in a little bit above our 35 to 40 guidance. Small cell activity was a little higher and so we got a little bit more prepaid activity - prepaid rent proceed in that case for 2018. Going forward, I think what we said is somewhere in the 30 to 40 range in 2019. That would be over and above the 3.27 million you talked about so total all in. That's the number I think you're looking for.","Walter Piecyk","And then just one other question, as far as the churn makeup, when you look at the guided churn, assuming the tower churn is in this kind of whatever 2% to 2.1% ballpark, right? And then so for the fiber business, what's left over is if you get 25% of your business is small cells and that's whatever let's say 1.5% churn that's probably high given its early stage.","To get to your the guided churn or disconnect stuff that's implying like a 10% churn number for the enterprise business. Am I thinking about that properly in terms of kind of breakdown of the churn?","Jay Brown","Yes. I think you're close. I think on the tower side both for 2019 and years beyond, we think the churn rates are around 1% to 2%. And as you mentioned, we're going to be at the high end of that for 2019. Our working assumption for long term is that small cells are going to have about the same level of churn.","Fair to say that maybe in the short term here we don't see quite that level, but in that same 1% to 2% range. And then on the fiber side, we think it's high single digits. So we've talked about the fact that we think it's about 9% in 2019 in the outlook that we gave.","Walter Piecyk","So your base is pretty conservative then because the numbers - if you put 9% in there then now that would kind of to get to the low-end of the range. So I guess that the guidance in the churn sounds like it's fairly conservative then, unless - because there is no exogenous churn events in macro towers I don't think expected in 2019 right?","Jay Brown","Yes. I think we're probably - we're trying to give ranges, so depending on where you point in the range you squeeze out the other side and - we're just trying to give a range. But I think from modeling purposes I think somewhere in the neighborhood, we think the fiber business is going to run in an around those high-single digits around 9% and then 1% to 2% on tower and small cells.","Walter Piecyk","Got it. Thank you.","Dan Schlanger","And Walt, just to clarify on the exogenous tower event. We do think that some of the - about half of the churn, we're going to see in towers is because of the acquired network churn that's coming through. So, I'm not sure you call that exogenous or not, but we didn't want to call it out. It's something that we see is we don't think it repeats forever.","Walter Piecyk","I may have to look that word up from the dictionary. You just used it. I'm not even sure what that means. But I appreciate the answers. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Amy Young from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Amy Young","I guess I'm just following up on our previous question, but I think your past view was that small cells return will be similar to macro sites at scale. I guess where do you think you are? And how far along are you to reach scale? And has there been anything in the past year that's changed your view on that? Thank you.","Jay Brown","Amy, we're really early days on small cells. So our initial yields on small cells as I mentioned are around 6% to 7%. If you look at our entire Fiber segment with small cells and the fiber solutions, we're getting about an 8% yield on the invested capital around fiber. So we've taken both the acquisitions that we've done as well as the builds and we've grown - we've already grown the yield on the $13 billion that we spent there above kind of our initial entry point.","On the tower basis, if we roll the clock back to a couple of decades ago when we first started acquiring towers, we acquired a significant number of our towers at about a 3% yield and have grown that yield over the last two decades.","If you look at this on a micro sense and we look at what's the return on tower versus return on a small cell system they're very comparable. As we add additional tenants to small cells, we see the returns and the margin expand at about the same pace, if not maybe slightly faster on the margin side than what we saw in the tower business.","And at the end of the day, we see returns with pretty reasonable assumptions around what we think lease-up is, somewhere in the neighborhood of about the equivalent of little over two tenants per tower. On a tower basis, if we were to do that same math on the small cell side, we would get two returns that are well above a blended cost of debt and equity and provide substantial return as we think about growing the dividends per share over the long-term.","Last thing, I'll mention about this is, the key characteristic around what drives that return is what is the lease-up associated with the asset. So you enter the asset with an anchor tenant and have a going-in yield from a tower aside. Historically, it's been about 3%. Small cells it's about double that at 6% to 7%. But then what's the co-location model look like and at what rate do we see co-location and that drives the return long-term.","Our experience has been thus far that the pace of leasing on existing investments we've seen lease-up that's about twice the pace of what co-location is on the tower has happened over the last decade or so. So we've accelerated the pass towards co-locating and sharing the asset as we've deployed these early systems with the small cells as the second and in some cases third tenant has come along and use that same system.","So our thesis in terms of the model is similar to towers is playing out at the same time that we're scaling the business significantly. As I mentioned, I think I mentioned this last quarter in 2019, we think we'll deploy roughly double the number of small cells or double the growth that we had in 2017. So that kind of growth is expanding the overall size of the pie.","And as we look at it on a micro sense, the model is playing out, but it's playing out against the scale of assets that's much smaller than the entire size of the investment is today, because it's grown so significantly in terms of our investment and opportunity that when you look at the yields on the total, yes it's headed in the right direction going from initially 6% to 7% to now 8%, 8% plus. But the overall book of that growth and the total return yield is going to take many years just like what it did in towers as we move the base and increase the opportunity.","Amy Young","And I guess just following up on that, I think we've seen one or two carriers deploy small cells internally. And what do you think is driving that decision? And does that potentially shape your view on what you just said?","Jay Brown","I think there are - I think all of the carriers are deploying small cells in some form of a self-perform. We certainly don't anticipate that we'll win 100% of the market share just like we've never done that on the towers side either. We think at the moment we're somewhere in the neighborhood of about half of what's getting deployed that we're winning.","And I think the fact that the carriers are self-performing should be a good indication of the fact that it's a good business, and they need small cells. There are certain locations where we're going to choose not to build them, because we don't see the lease-up opportunity there, and therefore we don't see the shared economics for great returns over the long-term.","So I think the carriers will continue to self-perform in places where we don't view those to be the best places to invest capital. And just like we saw for a long time on the towers side where carriers built their own towers in places where tower companies or others were not willing to invest the capital in order to build the infrastructure.","Operator","We will now take our next call from Spencer Kurn from New Street Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Spencer Kurn","I'm just wondering you've guided to $120 million to $130 million of new leasing revenue on towers in 2019. How does that compare to what you guys saw in the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to gauge whether your guidance assumes any acceleration in activity or is it pretty much an annualization of this past quarter? Thanks.","Dan Schlanger","Spencer, it's similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. But as what we're talking about and have talked about what we're excited about is just the level of activity increasing over time and all of our customers being active across our towers business. So we do think that that will continue through 2019.","Spencer Kurn","And I just have one other question on node density, I think in small cells. I think today you've got around two nodes per mile on average. And sorry it's actually lower than that. But my question is, we've heard of some deals where carriers are signing deals for 10 to 20 nodes per mile. I was just curious, could you talk about the sort of distribution of your small cell node density? Sort of how many markets do you have with node density maybe 10 nodes per mile or five nodes per mile? I'm not sure how you break it out. And then also, are you seeing this set of deals becoming more prevalent in your conversations? Thank you.","Jay Brown","Yes, Spencer, just to clarify a couple of points. So when we're deploying new fiber and building it for the purpose of small cells, our average is just over two nodes per mile currently as we're deploying. That's how pretty consistent. When you get to the specific examples and we start to look at some case studies, we could show you many examples in dense urban markets where the node count is between six and 10 nodes per mile and we don't think those are by any means isolated examples.","We think that over time, we're going to continue to see a density that's significantly beyond what we are currently in terms of small cells per mile. That's well beyond - if we start talking about six to 10 nodes per mile that's well beyond what we're underwriting when we do - when we decide to make these investments.","We're closer to underwriting in the neighborhood of about four or little over four nodes per mile in terms of the density. So if ultimately networks get to kind of some of the numbers that you're talking about and I believe there is a case where that could happen that's not in our underwriting case, but we've both seen it in practice and believe depending on the density that ultimately happens and is necessary for the 5G, we could get well beyond what we are underwriting when we make these investments. And time will tell on that front.","But as we look at individual case studies and look at some markets some of the early deployments in both center of business districts, as well as some areas of suburbia, we do find examples. As the carriers go out and initially deploy they're deploying somewhere in the neighborhood of two per mile. A second carrier comes along and does a similar deployment and then one of those two original carriers comes back and adds additional nodes to that existing deployment in order to increase the density.","So we end up getting lease-up if you will in co-location both from the existing deployment, as well as a secondary deployment that comes back and has additional nodes in order to increase the density. We think over time that's the way this is going to play out.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Robert Gutman from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robert Gutman","It seems like almost 80% of CapEx is on the fiber and small cells side. It seems like small cells specifically would be a small portion of that at this point. Can you discuss broadly how it's being spent? Is this on the organic sort of dense fiber builds in markets and markets that you mentioned earlier that you're trying to get to organically? What is the timing of associated revenue generation on that? In other words, is it specifically linked to the backlog of small cells? Or is it just building without specific contracts? That's basically what I'm trying to get at.","Dan Schlanger","Sure. I think just trying to take a step back and tell you how we think about spending capital. What we're doing is we're spending capital to build the fiber in markets where we see significant demand for small cells and continuing increases in that demand for small cells.","So what we're trying to do is take markets where we think it's going to ultimately be very conducive for small cells. And we will only start building in those markets when we have a contract in order to do so.","So when we think about what that new capital expenditure - revenue-generating capital expenditure looks like, the majority of it isn't our fiber segment, but the vast majority of that is going in to build small cells systems.","Having said that, those small cells systems include fiber that as Jay was pointing out earlier will put us in a position to go after some fiber solutions business that we're really interested in within those markets because it will likely be that the small cell deployment is close to where that fiber solutions business will come as well.","But to your specific point on what the revenue timing is, since the vast majority of that is for fiber, I mean, is for small cells, the fiber that support small cells, it's an 18-month to 24-month on average deployment cycle, which means that the capital will come in through the course of that 18 months to 24 months before we see the revenue come in from it. But there's not going to be a case where we're spending capital and hope that someday we'll get revenue on it.","Robert Gutman","And earlier in the call you mentioned, I think prior to this call you targeted 6,000 to 8,000 deployments in 2018 of small cells nodes. You had also prior mentioned the 35,000 node backlog.","I think earlier today you said 20,000 node backlog, but I would assume that's net of the 10,000 to 15,000 you expect to deploy this year. So then conclusion would be the backlog is unchanged? Is that right?","Jay Brown","Yes. So the short answer is yes, but I just want to make sure we get to all the same points. We have about 65,000 nodes either on air or under development. That number really hasn't changed. And so there hasn't been a significant move in that.","We've put around 7,000 nodes on air in 2018. And as Jay mentioned, the ending 2018 backlog was higher than the beginning 2018 backlog and so that we more than replaced the nodes we put on air with new bookings.","Looking forward, we think 10,000 to 15,000 nodes we put on air in 2019 and then we have 20,000 or so that will be put on air 2020, in the year 2020 or beyond. So you're right. The short answer is no. The backlog really hasn't changed. We're just trying to get a little more color around the timing and how that looks going forward.","Robert Gutman","Last small point, could you break out the final leasing by segment sort of in a light as it compares to the guidance that was outstanding in terms of tower of small cells and fiber?","Jay Brown","Are you asking for 2018?","Robert Gutman","Yes.","Jay Brown","So the new leasing activity was around 110 for towers around 60 for small cells and around 45 for fiber solutions.","Operator","We will now take our last and final question from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Phil Cusick","I guess two please if I can. First as we think about those term extensions that drove higher straight-lined revenue it seems like that would be activity beyond regular way. But you've raised straight-line guide nearly every quarter in the last couple of years.","Can you give me examples of what this is sort of unexpected activity might be and why it might not happen in a particular quarter?","Jay Brown","Yes. It's not unexpected activity. It's related to new leases that we think - we understand are coming. It's just the timing of that is sometimes difficult to predict, but it's also the length of the term extension that we get maybe different than what we have in our forecast and that can drive incremental straight-line activity.","Phil Cusick","Is it fair to say that you come in guiding for sort of the worst case in what those extensions might look like? And then as they come in you just stretch out the straight-line?","Jay Brown","I wouldn't call it worst-case, but it's hard to predict. And so I think we're probably on the conservative side of that assumption specifically yes.","Phil Cusick","That helps. Thanks. And then what do you see - any change in the trends in enterprise fiber demand? Any change in bookings or churn pace there? Thanks.","Jay Brown","We really haven't seen any trends there. As we've now had the business for about a year. I think it is played out roughly in line with what our expectations were going into the business. I think we're getting better at understanding how the business works and how to position ourselves in the market. But I wouldn't point to anything that's changing our long-term view of how that business will perform.","Jay Brown","Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning. Obviously, we were thrilled with the outcome in 2018 and excited about the opportunity ahead as we talked about on the call this morning on a number of fronts the increased level of leasing activity around towers and small cells is exciting given what it means not only for calendar year 2019, but also what we think it what it will mean over the long term as the carriers look to deploy beyond 4G and into the 5G world.","So thanks for joining us this morning. Look forward to catching up soon."],"6111":["Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 25, 2012 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Fiona McKone - Vice President of Finance","Jay A.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Fiona McKone. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Fiona McKone","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us as we review our third quarter 2012 results. With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.","To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investor section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will discuss throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements and information based on management's current expectations.

Brown","Thanks, Fiona, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our press release and as outlined on Slide 3, we had an excellent third quarter, exceeding the high end of our previously issued guidance for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations or AFFO.","The strong year-to-date results from our site rental business, together with better than expected performance from our services business, allows us to increase our 2012 outlook for adjusted EBITDA.","In addition to our strong operating results, we recently announced an agreement to acquire the rights to lease and operate approximately 7,200 T-Mobile towers in the U.S. for $2.4 billion, with a similar concentration in the top urban locations as our existing tower portfolio, reinforcing our position as the largest provider of wireless infrastructure in the U.S. We expect to close this transaction later this quarter, and then we'll talk more about why we're excited about this investment and other recent industry news.","Further on, October 15, we closed on a $1.65 billion senior notes offering, the proceeds of which, together with cash on hand and drawings under our revolving credit facility, are expected to be used to fund a portion of the -- to fund the consideration of the T-Mobile tower transaction.","With that, let me turn to Slide 4 as I highlight some of the results of our third quarter.","During the third quarter, we generated site rental revenue of $539 million, up 15% from the third quarter of 2011. Site rental gross margin, defined as site revenues less cost of operations, was $403 million, up 16% from the third quarter of 2011.","Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2012 was $400 million, up 20% from the third quarter of 2011.","As shown on Slide 5, AFFO was $230 million, up 22% from the third quarter of 2011. And AFFO per share was $0.79, up 20% from the third quarter of 2011.","Moving on to investments and liquidity, during the third quarter, as shown on Slide 6, we spent $124 million on capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $30 million in our land lease purchase program, $8 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $86 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures, consisting of $37 million on existing sites and $49 million on the construction of new sites, primarily distributed antenna systems deployments or small-cells.","On October 15, we closed on the aforementioned $1.65 billion senior notes offering with an interest rate at 5.25% per annum. These notes mature in 2023.","Pro forma for the closing of the T-Mobile tower transaction, we expect total net debt to annualize adjusted EBITDA to be less than 6.5x.","Moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2012, as shown on Slide 7 and Slide 8, we expect site rental revenue of between $538 million and $543 million, and adjusted EBITDA between $398 million and $403 million for the fourth quarter of 2012.","The sequential change to site rental revenue for the fourth quarter is negatively impacted by approximately $2 million of nonrecurring site rental revenue we received in the third quarter that we do not expect to recur in the fourth quarter.","Additionally, the assumed Australia exchange rate in the fourth quarter is lower than the actual exchange rate in the third quarter, resulting in a negative impact of approximately $1 million in site rental revenue as compared to the third quarter.","We are forecasting services gross margin in the fourth quarter to be lower by approximately $2 million from the third quarter.","Further, AFFO in the fourth quarter of 2012 includes $18 million of interest expense associated with the recently closed $1.65 billion financing, the proceeds of which we expect to use to fund the T-Mobile tower transaction.","Our revised outlook for 2012 suggests annual site rental revenue growth of 13% and AFFO growth of 16%, including the impact of the aforementioned interest expense.","Moving to the outlook on Slide 9. On an apples-to-apples basis, we expect AFFO growth in 2013 to be approximately $120 million, essentially the same amount of growth we are forecasting in 2012.","For the full year 2013, we expect site rental revenue of approximately $2.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.6 billion and AFFO of approximately $885 million.","As noted before, we have excluded any benefit from the T-Mobile tower transaction in our outlook, both in 2012 and 2013.","However, given that we have closed on a portion of the financing for the expected transaction, we have included the interest expense of approximately $86 million for the full year 2013, associated with the $1.65 billion senior note.","At a high level, our 2013 outlook for AFFO indicates 14% growth in AFFO per share before the expected benefit from the investment of our expected 2013 cash flow and the T-Mobile tower transaction.","Generally, we believe the investment of our cash flow can add approximately 400 to 600 basis points to our growth rate in AFFO per share, as has been the case for the last several years.","We believe that AFFO per share is the best metric to value our business as it represents our potential dividend capability as we expect to convert to a REIT in the coming years after we have largely consumed our net operating losses.","As you have heard us say for a long time, we evaluate the decisions that we make in the business based on the long-term impact to cash flow per share, and AFFO is the best proxy for this.","As you can see from the outlook, this growth rate in AFFO is meaningfully higher than the growth in site rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA. So I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through some of the various assumptions in our 2013 outlook.","The 2013 outlook for site rental revenue growth of approximately $100 million assumes that the majority of the 2013 leasing activity comes from the 4 largest U.S. carriers as amendment activity related to 4G deployment.","As a result of Crown Castle's previously disclosed agreements with these 4 carriers, a significant portion of the revenue benefit of this 2013 amendment activity is already included in the run rate of site rental revenue as of the third quarter of 2012.","With regard to our expectations from small-cells, we expect site rental revenue from small-cells to increase approximately 40% in 2013 compared to 2012. The demand for small-cells continues to exceed our original expectations as we are building systems, laying infrastructure and staffing appropriately to meet this demand.","The vast majority of the growth in site rental operating expenses is related to the expansion and deployment of new small-cells systems.","Further, we expect year-over-year site rental revenue growth from Australia of approximately 9% as the carriers are beginning to upgrade for 4G and we begin to see the benefit from the deployment of the National Broadband Network.","In addition, the 2013 outlook assumes 2% growth from escalators on the existing run rate of revenues, offset by tenant terminations of approximately 1% of total site rental revenue, which is consistent with historical averages.","With regard to our services business, we are expecting the contribution to gross margin to be similar to that of 2012.","As shown on Slide 9, the net result of these assumptions is that we expect site rental revenue for 2013 to increase approximately $100 million and adjusted EBITDA to increase approximately $65 million.","The greatest impact to our incremental margins is our decision to continue to expand and invest in small-cells, which we believe will have a terrific long -- we believe will have terrific long-term returns, but requires a meaningful investment in operating expenses as we scale the business and deploy new systems.","As such, we expect 2013 AFFO to increase by approximately $120 million or 14% compared to 2012, excluding the expected benefit from the T-Mobile tower transaction and the 2013 interest expense associated with the $1.65 billion senior notes raised in advanced of the expected transaction.","Turning to Slide 10. Our 2013 AFFO benefits from the cash impact of new leasing activity and the significant increases in the contracted cash payments under the previously announced agreements with our customers related to the ongoing 4G deployments.","As we've mentioned over the last several years, we have been very successful in working with our customers to extend the terms of our site rental contracts and gain certainty of the benefit from the deployment of 4G across the significant portion of existing leases on our U.S. tower portfolio.","Over the past 3 years, we have been able to renew and extend approximately 2\/3 of our customer contracts with initial terms of up to 15 years.","Due to these long-term customer contracts with fixed escalations, in the early years of the term, we recognized site rental revenues in advance of the contracted cash payments from our customers in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We have a similar dynamic in site rental expenses as we recognized higher site rental expense than the actual cash rental payment as a result of renewing our ground leases with fixed escalation for long periods of time.","As shown there, we have graphed all of our existing leases, particularly with regard to our revenue tenant leases for years 2012 through 2020, showing the expected reported amounts of cash receipts.","As shown, we would expect that beginning in about 2015 or 2016, our cash receipts from tenant leases will exceed the amount of reported site rental revenues.","For purposes of generating the graph, we have assumed that all leases are renewed at their respective term end dates.","As illustrated in the graph, based on the aforementioned assumptions, we expect that our cash receipts from our existing tenant licenses will grow at approximately 4% per annum for years 2012 to 2020 based on the contracted terms of these licenses.","We have made no assumptions in the graphs with regard to additional tenant leases.","The cash benefit of these lease agreements is reflected in our AFFO outlook, which is the primary reason our expected growth in AFFO exceeds our expectation for growth in adjusted EBITDA in 2013.","On Slide 11, with regards to our capital spending in 2013, we expect to invest approximately $350 million on capital expenditures related to the purchases of land beneath our towers, the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites, including small-cells.","Our AFFO, after expected capital expenditures, represents a little over $130 million per quarter of cash flow that we could invest in activities related to our core business, including purchases of our shares and acquisitions.","Consistent with our past practice, we are focused on investing our cash in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share.","While not included in our 2013 outlook, let me quickly run through the expected benefit of the T-Mobile transaction, which is outlined on Slide 12.","We estimate that the T-Mobile towers will produce approximately $125 million to $130 million in AFFO before financing costs in 2013.","Further, we expect to fund the balance of the consideration beyond what was raised in the 5.25% notes offering for the T-Mobile tower transaction through drawings under our revolving credit facility, which has a borrowing cost of LIBOR plus 250 basis points or approximately 3%, currently.","As a result, we expect the T-Mobile tower transaction, net of the related debt financing cost, to be accretive to our outlook for AFFO in 2013.","In summary, we had an excellent third quarter. We're very pleased to have been able to access the capital markets at a very attractive rate to fund our T-Mobile tower transaction, bringing greater clarity to the accretion we expect from the transaction.","We are excited about the growth we are seeing in small-cells, and we expect to deliver mid to high teens\u2019 growth in AFFO per share in 2013.","And with that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Ben.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Thanks, Jay, and thanks to all of you for joining the call this morning. It\u2019s a busy time this week with a lot of calls.","As Jay just mentioned, we had an excellent third quarter, exceeding our outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. And we're excited about our business as we look to the balance of the year. As you know, there is currently a significant amount of activity in our industry as all 4 major U.S. wireless carriers are engaged in major network upgrades simultaneously. We are enjoying unprecedented visibility into future growth as reflected in our increased 2012 guidance and our initial outlook for 2013.","We continue to make great progress integrating the NextG and WCP assets and are very pleased with the performance and growth of the small cell networks, which have exceeded our initial expectations.","In fact, organic leasing growth in small-cells is above our business plan, and we're excited to be investing in this growth area.","This activity is consistent with our continued -- with the continued adoption by the carriers of small-cells to create a better and more seamless experience by users in areas that are not adequately covered by the traditional macro tower infrastructure.","According to ABI Research, both DAS and small-cell equipment sales should reach the $2 billion mark by 2016.","In addition to the continued growth of our site leasing business, I'm very pleased that our services business continues to perform very well, reflecting the significant level of network upgrade activity in the market.","Service revenues were up 84% and service margins were up 63% compared to the same quarter last year. This success results from a diligent effort to capture more of the opportunities to assist our customers in locating or upgrading installations on our sites, and reflects the doubling of activity we are seeing from all 4 major carriers as they upgrade their networks compared to a year ago.","In addition to our strong organic leasing results, you might have heard we recently acquired -- announced the agreement to acquire the rights to the T-Mobile sites to lease and operate approximately 7,200 towers, which we expect will close later in the fourth quarter. We are thrilled with this transaction for a number of reasons.","Most importantly, consistent with our disciplined approach to maximizing long-term AFFO per share, I believe this transaction will be more accretive to our long-term growth rates and enhancing shareholder value relative to other potential investments such as even buying our own stock.","As Jay mentioned, we expect this transaction to be accretive both to our 2013 expected AFFO per share and approximately 5% accretive to our long-term expected AFFO per share.","We expect this transaction to close later in the fourth quarter and are very excited about the significant growth opportunity it provides.","Further, these towers are urban-centric, complementing our existing portfolio with 83% in the top 100 markets, and a significant concentration 72% in the top 50 markets. As you know, the top U.S. markets are where wireless traffic is heaviest and where carriers traditionally focus their efforts on deploying new technology, upgrades to existing technologies such as the current LTE upgrade.","This transaction positions us as the preeminent wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S. with an unrivaled tower footprint and furthers our strategic objective of being the leader in shared wireless infrastructure in the U.S., which we believe is the fastest growing and most profitable wireless market in the world.","In fact, the CEO of Softbank echoed this sentiment during the recent press conference on Softbank\u2019s investment in Sprint, citing the attractiveness of the U.S. wireless market due to rising ARPU, increasing smartphone and tablet penetration, and growth of multiple subscriptions as key reasons for his $20 billion agreement with Sprint.","Similarly, T-Mobile's planned merger with Metro PCS further confirms our thesis that the U.S. wireless market has significant growth potential. We believe that both the Softbank and T-Mobile investments in the U.S. wireless market will be very beneficial to our industry.","We are pleased to see the recent Softbank and T-Mobile actions endorsing our view of the U.S. wireless market.","To that end, we are investing in adding resources to take advantage of the market opportunity we see. Some of this can be seen in our outlook. We are investing in the operation and installation of more small-cells.","I believe this investment decision will yield significant benefits, not unlike when we invested years ago to build our own land lease acquisition capability.","Before I turn the call over for questions, I want to spend a minute on the trends that continue to drive the growth in our industry, particularly as it pertains to LTE deployments.","Verizon reported on their recent earnings call that the influx of LTE smartphones increased the number of LTE devices on their network to almost 15 million devices from just over 3 million during the same period last year.","Sales of LTE smartphones, tablets and modems are ramping quickly with a 44% increase between the second and third quarter of this year.","LTE devices now comprise over 16% of Verizon's postpaid subscriber base.","AT&T further confirmed this trend, stating that smartphone penetration had reached 64% of total subscribers.","As the number and adoption of LTE-enabled devices continue, we expect that it will provide a further catalyst for mobile data traffic growth.","During the first quarter of 2012, only 5.6% of U.S. subscribers were on a 4G network, and some research suggests or predicts a 16-fold increase in monthly mobile data traffic between 2011 and 2016, fueled by the faster and more robust LTE networks being deployed.","Clearly, the mobile Internet is the most pervasive trend driving consumer behavior today, and we are well positioned to benefit from this growth in mobile data traffic.","In fact, in 2012, this year, we have made over $4 billion in acquisitions pro forma for the T-Mobile towers, strengthening Crown Castle as the leader in shared wireless infrastructure, like towers and small-cells, where we believe our solution-based approach will be very attractive to carriers of today and tomorrow.","Today, we are the largest wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S. with an urban-centric portfolio where we expect capital spending activity to be the highest. We remain focused on the U.S. market, the largest and fastest-growing market in the world where we see the ability of the wireless carriers to make profitable investments is most apparent and barriers to entry remain high.","We are thrilled with the T-Mobile tower transaction, which reinforces our industry-leading position and we believe is accretive to both short-term and long-term AFFO per share. And leveraging our experienced management team, customer relationships and service offerings across our unrivaled tower footprint, together with our leadership in small-cell networks positions us as the provider of choice as carriers continue to enhance their networks to meet ever-increasing wireless demand.","We can certainly see this occurring today in our results as we are very pleased to be acting as a critical partner in the LTE upgrades being executed by our customers and the growth in small-cell commitments that we are seeing.","We appreciate their confidence and are working very hard to meet their deployment timelines.","So to wrap up, as Jay mentioned, our initial outlook for AFFO growth for 2013 of $120 million is essentially the same as our expectations for completing 2012 before accounting for the expected benefit of the T-Mobile tower transaction and the prospective investment of our significant and growing free cash flow across the balance of next year.","In other words, we see a path of AFFO growth accelerating next year.","So we look forward to finishing the year strong and we are committed to remain committed to delivering mid to high teens\u2019 growth in AFFO per share, maybe even 20% as a stretch goal I like to pass around the office, if things continue to go our way.","So with that, operator, we'll be happy to take -- turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Barclays.","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two if I could. First of all, can you talk through a little bit, now that you've had, I imagine, a further chance to look at the assets, what's your thoughts on the timeframe for lease up with the T-Mobile towers is and how you think about the long-term run rate? I mean, the existing portfolio is about 3 tenants per tower, I guess; where you think that can get to over time for the T-Mobile towers. And secondly, when you look at 2013, the available what, $530-or-so million in capital, have you seen anything changing in the environment that -- regarding deployment of the capital in terms of purchasing assets versus investing your own stock?","W. Benjamin Moreland","James, I'll take the first one and let Jay take the second one on the deployment of cash. As we have worked now through and start preparing for closing on the T-Mobile assets, our level of enthusiasm has only grown. We continue to see and expect significant leasing opportunities as we bring those sites in and integrate them and market them, and are able to provide the solutions-based approach both on services and the site leasing that those sites represent. As you know, it's a very significant increase in our footprint. It's about a 33% increase in our footprint with very high concentration in the top 100 markets. And so based on very preliminary indications from customers, we are more enthusiastic, I'll just say, than we have even at the beginning. And time will tell but we think we're going to be quite busy with those sites. So Jay, I'll let you take a crack at...","Jay A. Brown","James, on the second question around the $530 million that we have to invest, our strategy is the same as we've had for a number of years, which is we look to invest that cash flow in the opportunities that we think have the best chance to maximize long-term cash flow per share. And on that list of things that we will look at is everything from buying back our own stock, which we've done a significant amount of over the last decade, as well as doing things like tower acquisitions and building sites, particularly building small-cell sites, the small-cells that Ben talked about in his comments and I made some reference to in my comments. So I don't think there's any change in terms of how we look at investments and allocating that capital, and we don't have any pre-conceived plan as to what the allocation among those will be. We'll look at investments as they come up and allocate them to maximize long-term cash flow per share. One item I'll note for you, to some degree, we may use a relatively small portion of that cash flow to reduce the revolver borrowings. As you know, we're a little bit ahead of our targeted level of leverage range, about 4x to 6x. So we have growth in EBITDA that will move us back into the range relatively quickly, but we may use some relatively small portion of that cash flow to reduce the revolver balance. But we\u2019ll have to see how it goes into the course of the year. But really, no change in the strategy.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wonder if you could just give a bit of color underneath the 2013 guidance. To what extent have you included any new activity from Clearwire or from DISH in there? Or would that all be incremental to what you disclosed last night? And also, we're hearing more about companies that may be exceeding the boundaries of their initial MLAs. They're needing to put more gear up quicker than expected. Is that something that's starting to become important? And to what extent do you bake in some of that in as well?","Jay A. Brown","Sure, Simon. On the first one, it's pretty simple. There's really not anything included prospectively around Clearwire or around a prospective Dish network launch or sharing opportunity that they may avail themselves of with another carrier. We'll just have to, as we've said on prior calls, we're certainly open for business and open for dialogue there, and we anticipate that'll be a good outcome, but that\u2019s  certainly not in our outlook so far. And the second...","Jay A. Brown","The second question was around the excess gear that we're seeing some of the...","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, we are seeing some of that. We are seeing in various cases and it's not insignificant, but hard to forecast, where they\u2019re exceeding the original terms of the MLA and taking a second RAD center on the existing site to deal with the capacity challenges they're finding in that particular location. That's a hard thing to forecast, Simon, so we wouldn't try to quantify it for you, but it's certainly something that we're seeing.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And is that a sense that the traffic is just a lot greater than their original plan suggested? Is this happening earlier than you or they expected?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Well, I'd have to let them speak to the timing, but it's generally the configurations ultimately exceeding the capacity on the existing RAD center and\/or the height distinction based upon a different frequency that they're requiring. And so we're seeing occasions where they're taking a second RAD center on site.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just 2 if I could. First, maybe for Jay, just if I'm doing the math correct. So if I'm looking at AFFO guidance, it starts with 14% growth in the $120 million, which is coming from the core. And then if you're talking kind of 125 to 130 for T-Mobile, less $109 million of interest costs, which are 5.25% on the 1.6 and 3% on the rest, that gets you about another $18 million on top of the 120. And then if you reinvest your existing cash flow, you get 4% to 6% growth on top of the base, which is another 5%, which is another $40 million. So if I add those up, 120, 18, 40-plus, I get something around 21% AFFO growth based on the comments on this call. I just wanted to kind of make sure I was looking at that correctly and that's all before anything else happens in terms of new demand. I guess, is that fair, Jay?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, you've done it correctly, David.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And so that's a -- it sounds like a good news story. The thing I think the market's struggling a little bit with is trying to square that with the historical perception that the tower business is, it's 5% cell site growth and 4% escalators, minus 1% churn is 8% revenue growth. And what it kind of sounds like you're baking into the model here is almost no new cell site growth at all, some escalators, some churn, and you're netting out to a much smaller revenue number than people are used to seeing. And I guess the question really is, is what you're telling us about the demand profile, is this a sea change in the evolution of the industry? Is this a conservatism? Is this something that's getting lost in the translation from GAAP accounting to cash accounting? Why doesn't this look like what we're used to seeing in terms of growth from this company?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. That's a great segue to go back to kind of what I was trying to step through in my prepared comments around the differences between the growth in adjusted EBITDA versus, as you've correctly laid out, the growth in AFFO. So we're expecting AFFO growth on a normalized or an apples-to-apples basis of about $120 million. And if you go back up the income statement and look at adjusted EBITDA, about $65 million of adjusted EBITDA growth. And the difference there is the function of really 2 things: First of all, as you've highlighted, there are some differences in terms of the cash revenues that we're collecting and our GAAP revenues. So over the last several years, as we've announced, we've done a number of agreements with carriers who are now deploying 4G activities. And those agreements gave them certain rights to add additional equipment to our towers based on the contracted cash payments that they made with us. So under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we have to go in and go ahead and book that revenue because it's certain on the day at which we make the agreement with the customer and then we receive the cash over time. And so what's happening in our numbers now is you're seeing the significant uplift in the steps of cash payments from these customers associated with that activity. Now in the past, we didn't have certainty of the activity. So as we would go into any given year and we added tenants to the towers, that would represent both new revenue and new cash. And in this case, because we have certainty of the activity, the revenue is already included in the run rate as we leave 2012. And then over the course of the year, we get the contractual steps and cash payments from those leases. And so during the period of time, all that to say, during the period of time under which we\u2019re -- the carriers are deploying the 4G equipment as permitted under their agreements with us, we don't expect to see a real large meaningful impact to site rental revenues, but we do expect to continue to get the benefit of the contractual cash steps in those payments. So that's the first reason. The second reason is the comments that I made around our small-cells business. And we are making an investment, as you can see in the cost increase in 2013 from 2012. We're making an investment in operating costs. And those operating costs are driving 2 things: One is giving us operational scale in the business so that we can continue to operate these systems, and the second one is deploying new systems. And the combination of those 2 creates incremental margins that are lower than what we've seen in the past, and that's all being driven by this investment of additional operating cost in the small-cell business. So that's really the reason why you've got this separation, which, as you correctly pointed out, is different than what we've seen in the past. But at the same time, it's I think one of the reasons why we've tried over the last several years to focus our conversation on cash flow per share. And this is long-term, the best, as we believe, the best indication of what our capability is to issue a dividend over the long period of time. So that AFFO per share number reflects all of the changes in how we structure the customer agreements and we're seeing the benefit of big steps in cash.","W. Benjamin Moreland","I would just add one other thing to that. For example, this -- the activity we've seen in the last quarter, in this third quarter, about 70% of the activity that we saw going on the towers was actually presold. So it's important to remember that these contracts that we did, we're effectively preselling the 4G upgrade activity across a significant base of our customer base. And so we're now collecting the cash for that, and those are contracted cash payments over the term of that as licenses, as Jay mentioned and we've talked about before, 9 years of term. And the graph says from 2012, 2020, that contracted escalator of about 4% across the entire book of business. And so that is sort of all-inclusive number. And so you see the cash going up, but the run rate, to a large degree, related specifically to the 4G upgrades are already presold. However, you do make a point which we certainly expect to see over time. It's just hard to see at the moment. And that is increasing levels of leasing and sales beyond what's already contracted. And that would be from cell splitting; that would be from the second RAD center we talked about a minute ago, people taking more than is permitted under the current MLAs; the growth in the small-cell business, all those things we think become more meaningful as we go through these LTE upgrades. And that is incremental revenue and obviously, cash flow over time, but certainly, not contemplated in the current agreements that are making up the majority of our current revenue stream.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.","Marc Albanese - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","This is Marc Albanese on for Jonathan. I just wonder what network services. When thinking about 2013, should I really be focusing on your run rate in the third quarter or more of a blended average on 2012? And also, when you do look to convert to REIT, are these going to be part of a TRS or QRS?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, the first question, with a big groan from all the Crown Castle people working on this, I'd say we're focused on sort of the current run rate. And we are seeing a tremendous amount of activity; we've got a lot of people working very hard to deliver that. But that's basically our focus, is sort of the second half of the year run rate.","Jay A. Brown","Marc, your second question. I would say we're still in the early days of preparing for a REIT reconversion. Obviously, we don't expect to exhaust our net operating losses until 2015 -- towards the end of 2015 or early 2016, so we're in the early days of beginning this work. However, I would tell you, from our initial look at it, the vast majority of the services work that we perform would qualify as REIT income. And so we would expect, at least at this point, I would expect that our services business will not be in a separate taxable REIT subsidiary.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I want to follow up on some of David's comments, maybe give you a couple of quick questions on the guidance front. First, when the T-Mobile deal closes, will you consider updating guidance at the closing or do we expect that, that should come on the next quarterly call?","Jay A. Brown","I believe we'll update it when we get to January, at the end of January when we report our fourth quarter results.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second question, you've talked a lot about the spending on the -- investing in the small-cell side. Is that both -- am I interpreting it correctly, that's both OpEx and CapEx? And if so, what line item in the OpEx area will that affect?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, it is some of both. And Rick, I think, as I articulated, the spending there on small-cells, I think on the capital side, we will continue over time to make investments in these to build additional systems. We believe that on the operating expense side, which is going to hit site rental direct operating cost, so as you look at the numbers, that would impact site rental gross margin for 2013. We believe that is a bit of a onetime step-up as we build scale into the -- operating scale into the business. But that is affecting our direct site rental gross margins.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on your CapEx budget that you gave towards the end of the presentation. Can you break that down into the different categories of land and augmentation and small-cells?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On the -- on land side, we'll spend in the neighborhood of about $100 million on land. We'll spend about $100 million on -- $100 million to $150 million on distributed antenna systems or small-cell activity. And then we'll spend most of the rest of the balance of that on upgrading existing sites for new tenants. And then there will be some small portion of that CapEx that will be spent on building new towers.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then probably the more interesting question, T-Mobile, when they made the announcement of buying Metro PCS, has mentioned that they want to keep the DAS network or DAS networks that Metro had built for them. And I think several of those were done by NextG. T-Mobile mentioned that they need to add not just -- would have the CDMA network, but they need to add the GSM, HSPA Plus, LTE. Is that in your guidance yet? And what are your thoughts about that co-location opportunity on those DAS networks?","W. Benjamin Moreland","We've been a little gentle in our DAS guidance, Rick. We are tracking ahead of our original acquisition model on the NextG acquisition. But as you rightly point out, those amendments that would come across an existing base would be additional revenue opportunities, and we look at it really as a total pot of new revenues. So we go through it at line by line granular level and look at, okay, here's amendment opportunities, here's additional co-location opportunities and then here's brand-new system opportunities to which we are, in fact, engaged by Metro PCS today on some systems, which we're very pleased with. So we really build it from the ground up, and so we're not always sure as -- we've been in this business a long time. It's not a perfect science. We get it about 60% to 70% right in terms of predicting exactly what the components of revenue are, because obviously, we can't completely predict customer behavior and timing. But I'd say all those factors are considered as we go into what our lease-up expectation or revenue growth on small-cells is. But taken in aggregate, we are certainly tracking above what we originally planned. And I think there's probably a little upside left, but we'll have to see how that goes.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But explicitly, the T-Mobile, Metro one was probably not part of your process.","W. Benjamin Moreland","No, not really.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just one quick follow-up on the revenue growth question just because, obviously, it's important. You gave a lot of helpful qualitative comments, but I think you've also given people a way to quantify all this. So when you talk about 1% revenue growth in existing tenant leases and if you sort of step back, your guidance actually implies 4.7% total site rental revenue growth. But then if you remove the non-cash portion of this to the changes year-over-year, you're actually implying just above 7% cash revenue growth in 2013. So A, is that the way you guys see it? And then B, if so, how does that compare to what was implied in sort of the forward guide in previous years? Because it seems like it's probably not all that different. And then second quick question is just on churn. Last year, you sort of called out potential for lumpy Alltel-related churn. Are there any other big churn pools that you would call out that's included in the 2013 guide?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On the first question, Jason, I think you've described it correctly. There's about 5% revenue growth; 1% of that is coming from the base of business. It's 2% growth in escalators, less about 1% of churn. And then the balance of it is coming from leasing-related activity on the portfolio. In the past, over the last couple of years on an organic basis, if you will, or a same-tower sales basis, we've been growing revenues about 8%, 8% to 9% in total, about 1% to 2% out of the base, and then 6% to 7% out of organic leasing. So our leasing assumption is down, but to your point, if you were to adjust it and consider that we presold a significant amount of the opportunity in 2013, we're looking at something that's relatively comparable to past years making that adjustment. And obviously, as we look forward over the long-term, as Ben mentioned, we think there's opportunities for that number to go back up as the activity moves from just simply being amendment activity on related leases to going back in being infill sites or adding additional RAD centers to towers that they're already located on. On your second question around churn, there's no significant items or meaningful items that I -- individual customers that I would single out for 2013 in terms of churn. 1% churn is in line with our historical levels of churn, and so it looks like a normal year. I would mention that on the horizon, although not in 2013, is obviously, the changes that Sprint had looked at with regard to their iDEN network. iDEN makes up about 3% of our consolidated revenues. And we would expect, to the extent that they ultimately do decommission and don't redeploy those sites for CDMA or LTE, that we would see the churn of that revenue beginning at the beginning of 2014 and then see that 3% come off over the calendar year '14 and then the first half of 2015. So I don't have great clarity, obviously, at this point as to the exact timing of that, but if you were to assume 3% over those 6 quarters, that's at least the bookend of where we think this thing plays out if ultimately they decommission that. But in the short-term, I don't have any visibility towards any specific events in calendar year '13.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just want to clarify. On the 2% escalator, that's obviously lower than what we've historically seen. It's been more like 3.5%. Is that a function of the way the revenue is being straight-lined under the MLA?","Jay A. Brown","It is, Brett. So on a cash basis, the cash is growing about 4%, and the benefit we're receiving on -- in GAAP revenues is about 2%. So that is exactly the impact of the straight-line.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then speaking of master lease agreements, maybe I'm wrong here but I think that the way the Sprint agreement works is that you don't necessarily have the presold capacity like you do with some other carriers. It was more a pricing structure where as a complete activity, you know in advance what you will get paid for it. So is that correct?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, it's priced as a unit basis, as a price for a certain configuration on the site as you identified, Brett, but it is a commitment on their part. So it's in the run rate, okay? So again, these rules -- we didn't make up the GAAP rules. But if it's a commitment, then it's straight-line revenue. And so it was based on a particular configuration on each individual site and a payment per site based on just as they would naturally have deployed, but it was structured as a commitment, such that we had to record the revenue when the commitment was made. And so that's effectively going through the numbers today. But again, the cash, you'll now see the cash go consistent with their commitment plan in terms of how they're phasing their LTE upgrade -- or network modernization plan, and that's, in fact, a contributor to what we're seeing in AFFO.","Jay A. Brown","Brett, one thing that may be just helpful is for us to just step back for a second and talk about the 4 big carriers at a high level in terms of what we've presold versus what we haven't. Because what's difficult for us, as we've talked about over time, is we've tried to get some clarity to what we've presold and what we haven't presold and how those contracts work in terms of our cash commitments. But each of those agreements are unique. And they're unique based on what the carriers believe their deployment schedule looks like. And so we've tried to be careful in terms of our description of these agreements to not give away what a particular carrier, an individual carrier is expecting to do or how many sites that they're going to do. So as we look at the big 4 carriers and the activity that's going on in the U.S. today for the deployment of 4G, there is some of that activity, and we would say the vast majority of that activity that's going on today, that is presold. And that's a mix of things where carriers had rights to make -- add equipment to existing levels and add existing levels on the towers. Then other situations, there is specific equipment that they can add to towers at a specific -- at the level that they're on currently. So there's a mix of how each of these agreements are structured. And the comments that we're trying to make in terms of giving you color around the 2013 outlook is to tell you that what we're seeing in terms of the activity and what we expect in 2013 is that the vast majority of that activity is actually included, already included in the run rate of site rental revenues. Now as we move out the timeline to the right and as the carriers, and we're seeing early signs of this, as the carriers look to add additional capacity to their 4G networks, there's a significant amount of that activity that's not presold. And so our assumption in the outlook for 2013 is that most of the activity is presold, but as we're seeing early signs of, we may get into the calendar year and find out that the phasing or deployment schedules of that activity may become sooner than what we had expected in our outlook. So it's -- when we start to ask about specific carriers, we want to be careful about how we answer the question, at the same time, trying to tie that back to the outlook that we gave. The outlook assumes that the vast majority of the activity is in the current run rate.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I appreciate that. The reason I brought Sprint is just because on their call this morning, they noted that Network Vision is maybe about a quarter behind schedule. And I was just trying to understand if there is any meaningful sensitivity to your guidance based on a quarter's of activity at Sprint.","Jay A. Brown","Not at this point.","W. Benjamin Moreland","No, because again, it's a committed payment structure so it's already in the revenue. One other point we didn't mention because, frankly, it's a little bit trivial. It's not trivial to us, but it may be trivial to you because you can't really see it in the revenue, is our outlook internally for leasing is up about 10% over 2012. But you can't see much of that in the number because so much of what we already see is already presold. So the amount then, the -- new activity, new leasing activity, x what's already been sold is actually up year-over-year. The reason we didn't really make a big deal of it is because you guys can't see it, and we appreciate that. We understand that. But it's ultimately cash and it's activity.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One more follow-up on the '13 guidance, if I could. So you mentioned in the third quarter that 70% of the activity was presold. So when we look at this 2013 guidance, should we assume a similar 70% presold or is that number higher? And...","Jay A. Brown","It's about that level, yes, Batya.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just a couple of quick follow-ups. In -- for the guidance straight-line revenue impact for 2012, I think you've lowered it a bit. Can you talk about why that reduction came in and if you could remind us how much of the straight-line impact T-Mo MLA added in the second half? And finally, just one question on the T-Mo towers. Can you quantify the exposure they have to iDEN and what contract life they have?","Jay A. Brown","Okay. On the first question, as I said but I was kind of speaking over you, apologies for that, approximately 70% of the activity in 2012 was related to -- was presold. And in 2013, it's a similar level, about 3\/4 of the amendment activity is really presold. With regards to the guidance, and we talked about this a little bit last quarter, we did -- we do expect cash in this calendar year to be slightly ahead of what we had previously guided. And I think as we get our sea legs under us and focus on cash, we'll probably continue to maybe be a tad conservative in terms of forecasting exactly where cash is in any given quarter. There's a few things that move around, obviously, related to that, to the billings and receipts of cash. And so I'll just let the guidance that we gave stand. With regards to iDEN on the T-Mobile site, it represents about 3% of the revenues, 3% of the revenues there.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And what's the average life of the contract?","Jay A. Brown","The average life of the contract's about 2.5 years, maybe a little less than 2.5 years.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And the straight-line impact that you included from T-Mo in the second half, is that $20 million?","Jay A. Brown","We didn't give a specific number on that, but it would be in the ballpark of about $20 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","Ben, you're now the Chairman of PCIA, and in Orlando, you mentioned you would be getting more involved in the process for the public safety network. Can you give us a few key events or milestones that you think we can look forward to, to get a sense if this is going to become reality over the next year or 2 for Crown in terms of a revenue driver?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Kevin, thanks for that. We are really excited about the progress that the FirstNet board has -- is already making. And this is going to be a -- it is going to be long-term and it's certainly not in our current outlook. But the recognition that, as mandated by Congress, that they, to the fullest extent possible, locate on shared infrastructure, i.e. existing towers co-location, we think is absolutely the right way to go. There's a lot of different potential architectures floating around about how this will actually get launched, whether it will be as part of a shared network with existing commercial carriers today, where they would contribute their spectrum and then be hosted effectively on those networks; or whether it will be a separate network built across co-location on towers. I think it's too early to predict that outcome, but we're very pleased that they actually -- there's 20 megahertz allocated, upwards of $7 billion depending upon how the auctions go, and obviously, a very concerted effort on their part to get moving on a National Public Safety Network. Given our position, with pro forma 30,000 sites, most of which in the top 100 cities, you can bet we, as Crown Castle, will be very interested and engaged in that process of facilitating their deployment regardless of how they ultimately decide the architecture goes. Whether it's a shared deployment with existing commercial networks, we can certainly participate in that, as we talked about before, or whether it's a discrete new build, we obviously know how to price configurations on towers and have the capability to get them installed very rapidly. So it's very early days, but there is progress being made, and we're encouraged and engaged, honestly, engaged in the process and in the conversation, and stay tuned. We think it's a, maybe a '14 or '15 event.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A lot's been asked and I apologize if this is out there yet, but Ben, can you talk about your service revenue a little bit? A big number this quarter. It's been ramping pretty nicely, and I know you typically guide fairly conservatively for it, but as you look at what you're doing for carriers and you look at the pace of their sort of updates of amending their networks, how do you see this trending not only in the fourth quarter? Does that look conservative or was there something in 3Q that was sort of a onetime? And then in '13, is there a point at which you see this sort of naturally flowing off unless something changes?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, what we basically have implied in the guidance is essentially the second half run rate of this year into \u201814 -- 2013. But, Phil, I appreciate the question because the crew doesn\u2019t get a lot of credit sometimes. We are -- we've seen twice the application volume on our sites in the third quarter as we saw in the third quarter of '11. So 2x the actual volume going through the door in terms of processing applications, and then an increasing level of those sites where we're actually handling the service, the installation work largely related to the LTE upgrade. And at the same time, we've increased the scope of services to include site acq and zoning work in many cases. So we're typically handling more of the individual transaction and booking more revenue and margin accordingly. So it's been a great outcome for us. It gives us not only a revenue opportunity, but it keeps us close to customers; it keeps us more in control of the deployment and helping them meet their deployment timelines, and obviously, helps us control what's going on our assets. Because we do a lot of our own structural analyses in-house, we can -- we just -- you're closer to the asset, which we think is the right thing to do. Financially, it's very difficult to predict how it continues to grow. Obviously, we're going through a timeline right now where there's a huge bubble of activity around all 4 carriers doing LTE amendment. In fact, we're adding people in the company to support that work. We didn't really mention it on this call because it's being covered by margin, as you would hope it is, which it is, so you really won't be able to see. But in addition to adding resource and investment in the small-cell business, we're doing the same to support the service level of activity, but again, it's self-funding, covered by the margin. Undoubtedly, you can look forward and say at some point in the future, you're going to see that start to tail off obviously, mitigated by the additional 7,300 sites we're bringing in on T-Mobile, so we expect to have service opportunity there as well, which might mitigate that step down. But certainly, when you see the level of activity in '12, I don't think you can just forecast that out forever. But at the same time, we're carrying costs there that we think are variable costs in many respects. And so you'd see the cost load come down as well. I think we'll take one more question since we're a little over our time. Appreciate everybody's patience.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I guess a big question is when -- how much capacity does the amendment activity give us and when does that run out? Do you think '14, we'll start to see the cell site splitting? '15, do they have enough capacity to get through '13 herein? And I guess, related to that, when do you think we start to see the shutdown of the 2G and 3G networks? What year does that really start to impact things?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, that's a tough one for us from our chair to address. I'd probably defer that to our customers. But in terms of as we see the deployment of LTE, we certainly see that continuing full-on '13 and '14. I mean, we've looked at it carrier-by-carrier and we see a lot of activity full year '14. So I don't think that's closed down. The real question is when do you start to see the cells splitting and that incremental revenue coming. As we mentioned a minute ago, we're actually already seeing that. And we're seeing that to the extent of a marginal amount of incremental leasing on our sites in terms of new co-locations, both in new sites and second RAD centers on existing sites. So we're already seeing that to a point, again, not really that material in the run rate yet, but we're encouraged by what we see, and I would expect you'll see that continuing gradually over time as we move out into second half of '13 and into '14. But right now, appreciate that everybody's pretty much every waking moment is being worked on, is consumed by LTE activity. Never have we seen 4 carriers, each trying to overlay an LTE upgrade as we're seeing now with T-Mobile just getting started. And so the industry is very busy if you talk around \u2013 you can just talk to vendors and people that you might know in the market. There's a lot going on and we're very pleased to be participating in that at the service level, and obviously, ahead of plan in many respects in terms of the presold revenue. But we'll get to a point where that has kind of run its course, and as we talk about public safety and potentially, the DISH Network spectrum coming into the market and additional co-location from cell splitting and things, there's plenty of upside long-term to what I would call organic revenue growth. And in the meantime, obviously, cash pays the dividend one day, and cash flow growth around here we continue to think is sort of mid-teens, as I mentioned, sort of stretched to 20%, and we're going to work pretty hard to get that done.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I think it's been -- do the carriers think the amendments give them enough capacity for the next 2 years or they're not really sure at this point?","W. Benjamin Moreland","It certainly gives them more capacity. That's just a technology fact. However, nobody has ever been in this environment where we continue to use more data than people can ultimately produce. You see tablets. I mean literally, every single morning on CNBC, there's a new company talking about their mobile strategy. And so that takes bandwidth; that takes sites. And so it's a -- we're in uncharted territory about how fast the data growth occurs and how fast that capacity gets consumed. Obviously, we're going to work very hard to keep up and we are thrilled with the position of the company, which has been very deliberate. I'll again say this year is, I think, going to turn out to be a watershed year for Crown Castle and how we have positioned the company for the next 10 years in terms of assets. But we are working very hard to keep up and we got a lot on our plate.","I would like to end the call. I appreciate everybody hanging with us a little longer than the hour. There's a lot going on in the industry. I know there's another call today or 2, so thanks, again, and we'll talk to you on the fourth quarter call."],"6326":["Crown Castle International Corp.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ben Lowe. Please go ahead, sir.","Ben Lowe","Great. Thank you, Todd and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our second quarter 2018 results. With me on the call is morning are Jay Brown, Crown Castle\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors, which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors section of the company\u2019s SEC filings.","Our statements are made as of today, July 19, 2018, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. In addition, today\u2019s call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures.","Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the Supplemental Information Package in the Investors section of the company\u2019s website at crowncastle.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Brown","Thanks, Ben, and good morning everyone. It's a great time to be a part of Crown Castle. We are uniquely positioned to win in our market due to our strategy, solutions and history.","Over the past two decades we have created an unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers and 60,000 route miles of dense high capacity fiber in the top U.S. markets.","As a result, our ability to offer customers integral components of leading edge communication networks continues to drive our success while generating high returns for our shareholders as we share our assets across multiple tenants.","Based on industry fundamentals and expected growth, we think that the US represents the best market in the world for communications infrastructure and that our differentiated strategy will capitalize on this compelling opportunity.","With the positive momentum, we are experiencing in our towers and fiber we remain bullish on investing in our business to generate future growth while delivering dividend per share growth of 7% to 8% per year.","On the call this morning, I want to highlight three important things I'm seeing in our business and the broader industry. First, we're delivering on another great year of growth in 2018.","Secondly, we're capitalizing on the trends that continue to build across towers, small cells and fiber. And we are investing at very attractive returns as we build the communications networks for the future.","On the first point, we delivered another great quarter of financial results reflecting the demand for our shared infrastructure assets and terrific execution by our team. As the volume of data delivered by both wireless and wired networks continues to grow our customers are increasing the capacity of their networks by leasing access to our towers and fiber, which in turn generates growth in our cash flows.","As a result, we remain on track to deliver approximately 10% growth in AFFO per share in 2018 with higher levels of new leasing activity across all of our business. The growth in cash flow supports our current annualized dividend of $4.20 per share representing 11% growth year-over-year. This growing dividend both aligns with our business model and provides a significant source of value to our shareholders.","Turning to the second point, momentum continues to build across both towers and fiber, with a growing backlog of committed new business. We are seeing persistent positive tailwinds across our business that are driving significant demand for our portfolio of shared infrastructure assets.","On the tower side of the business, our customers are improving and intensifying their network by adding more equipment to their existing leases and adding new leases on our towers.","As our customers invest more in their networks to keep up with the growing demand, our leasing activity remains on track to be higher in 2018 than it was last year.","Within our fiber business, those same underlying demand trends are also creating a need for our customers to deploy fiber fed small cells at scale to further improve the quality of their networks.","After starting the year off in the first quarter with a comparable number of small cell bookings to what we signed in all of 2016, we had another terrific quarter of bookings in the second quarter, as our contracted pipeline of small cell nodes to be constructed continues to increase.","Due primarily to the permitting and planning process, it typically takes us about 18 to 24 months for these contracted nodes to be put on air and start generating revenue. Consistent with our expectations, we continue to see very attractive returns on small cell investments, with initial yields of 6% to 7% for the first tenant.","And similar to towers we're seeing demand for multiple tenants on the same asset, resulting in high incremental margins that grow the yields into the mid to high teens. We expect these growth trends and attractive returns to hold. And if they do, we will continue to pursue discretionary investments that we believe will expand our long-term opportunity which brings me to my third and final theme.","We are really excited about the investments we are making to build new assets that we expect will drive long-term growth and cash flows and dividends per share. We believe we're in the very early innings of a huge opportunity with fiber which has become critical for wireless and wired networks.","Over the last several years, we have built and acquired more than 60000 route miles of dense high capacity fiber in the top markets where we see the greatest long-term demand for multiple customers. While the current utilization of our fiber is less than a single tenant tower, our current 8% yield is more than double what we saw when our towers only had one tenant.","We are using the exact same playbook we used with towers by sharing the asset across multiple tenants to drive attractive returns and it's playing out better than we could have expected. All of this increases our conviction to continue to invest in fiber where the expected returns and opportunities meet our disciplined investment criteria.","As I reflect on my 19 years at Crown Castle, it's remarkable to me how similar the opportunity around small cells and fiber is to the early days of the tower business. When we were acquiring and building towers nearly 20 years ago.","We were making significant upfront investments in assets with really skinny initial yield. This was based on our view at the time that we could increase the cash flows and yields from those assets over time as we added tenants.","Today everyone agrees the tower business is a great business. But in the early days of towers, there was no shortage of skeptics who thought that the towers wouldn't be shared by multiple customers or the returns would never exceed our cost of capital or anyone could overbuild us or the economics will be lost at renewals.","Steady performance and consistent execution over the last two decades has proven that providing shared communications infrastructure assets is a great business. Fast forward to where we sit today with the opportunity to once again invest in infrastructure needed for the future of communications.","Today, we have invested approximately $13 billion of capital that is already yielding 8% and have secured prime fiber real estate across the top US market, making Crown Castle the clear leader in small cells.","Since we made our initial investment in small cells, we have seen the market rapidly evolve from a small opportunity and only a few locations to where we are today with all four of the major wireless customers deploying small cells at scale across all of the top markets.","And we believe we are at the very beginning of what will ultimately be in opportunities that rivals or exceeds what we have seen play out with towers over the last two decades where demand has far surpassed what even we could imagine at the time we made our initial investments.","One of the things that we learned from our experience in towers is that investing early in the right assets in the top markets positions us to capture potential future demand that may arise beyond what is visible at the time of the investment, as communications evolve in ways we can't even conceive today.","We\u2019ve done our unmatched portfolio of assets, I believe Crown Castle is the best positioned to capture these immense long-term opportunities, while consistently returning capital to shareholders through a high quality dividend that we expect to grow 7% to 8% annually.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schlanger","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we had another quarter of results and remain on track to generate solid growth and cash flows and dividends for the full year.","We continue to benefit from very favorable industry fundamentals that are creating significant demand for our unmatched portfolio of towers and high capacity fiber assets, which is apparent in our financial results and outlook.","Starting with second quarter 2018 results, as you can see on slide four of the presentation, we exceeded the high end of guidance for site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA with AFFO exceeding the midpoint of the range. When compared to our prior outlook, there are two primary items that impacted second quarter results.","First, site rental revenues benefited from approximately $9 million of additional straight lined revenues primarily resulting from term extensions associated with leasing activity.","Second, some of the network services contributions we previously expected in the second quarter is now expected to come through the remainder of 2018.","Turning to the balance sheet. We recently executed two financing transactions that increased our financial flexibility. Specifically, we increased the commitments under our revolver by $750 million and extended the maturity date on our credit facility by approximately one year.","And in July, we refinanced $1 billion of existing secured tower revenue notes that would have matured in 2020 with new secured tower revenue notes that have a weighted average term of nearly nine years and an average coupon of 4.1%.","Pro forma for those transactions, we now have nearly $4 billion of available capacity on our revolver and a no meaningful debt maturities before 2021. Additionally, we finished the quarter at 5.2 times debt to EBITDA and expect to end the year at approximately five times due to the anticipated growth in EBITDA in the second half of 2018.","Now turning to slide five. At the midpoint, we increased the full year 2018 outlook for site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA while leading the outlook for AFFO unchanged.","The increases to site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA primarily reflect the higher expected contribution from straight lined revenues which does not impact AFFO.","Consistent with the additional straight lined revenues in the second quarter, the higher expected straight lined revenues from 2018 are a result of term extensions associated with leasing activity.","Turning to slide six. The only changes to our outlook for site rental revenue growth relates to the increase to straight lined revenues I just discussed that impact both the third bar from the right and the total growth in site rental revenues on the far right.","The left half of the chart which relates to our organic contribution of site rental revenues remains unchanged at the midpoints when compared to our prior outlook. Moving on to slide seven. We have maintained our outlook for the midpoint of AFFO growth from 2017 to 2018, but narrowed the ranges to now be between $400 million and $430 million.","So in closing, we delivered another quarter of great financial results and remain on track to generate 10% growth in AFFO per share in 2018. Momentum continues to build across towers, small cells and fiber which illustrates how well positioned our business is to capitalize on the positive industry fundamentals in the US.","Looking further out, we are excited about the current investments we are making in new assets that we believe will extend the long-term opportunity while generating compelling returns for our shareholders to a high quality dividend that we expect to grow 7% to 8% annually.","With that Todd, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.","Nick Del Deo","Thanks for taking my questions. First, with respect to Lightower and some of the other fiber assets you've required, you've indicated in the past that one of your goals was to apply some of Lightower's management practices to the other assets bringing more business out of them. What is - where does things stand on that front? And I guess, if you can comment on iteration more generally that would be helpful.","Jay Brown","Sure, Nick. Good morning. We do plan to do that. One of our premises as I talked about multiple tenants across the same asset is both the synergies that we bring in terms of revenue synergies that we bring in terms of adding small cells to the fiber that Lightower had constructed and also taking the platform that Lightower had and selling fiber solutions across the nearly 30,000 miles of fiber that we had which were built and acquired primarily for small cells.","And we're in the process of just doing exactly that so we're prioritizing the markets where we think that there's the greatest opportunity and we're in the process of working on that and more to come.","But as we had initially thought we believe there really are revenue synergies and growth opportunities around that and we're in the process - early days of working towards that end.","On the integration front, things are going well on track for what we had expected. And we expect the financial results for calendar year 2018 to come in right where we expected them.","So everything is performing within expectations and we're pretty excited about what the longer term opportunity of taking that platform out beyond just the fiber that we acquired directly from Lightower.","Nick Del Deo","Okay. That's great. And maybe one for Dan. Prepaid rent received in the quarter was pretty substantial. Is there anything that we should be aware of behind that? And I guess, more generally, should we think of that as a leading indicator for activity or a lagging indicator or just pretty much into it one way or the other?","Dan Schlanger","Yes. It's tougher pretty much into it one way or the other. The way I would interpret it is there is more activity it's just the timing of any one quarter versus another is too hard to read into.","The good part about it is I think what it shows is that activity is increasing overall and that we're continuing to see a contribution from our customers as we build out small cell nodes and systems.","Nick Del Deo","Okay. Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America.","David Barden","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, a couple, if I could. Just first on the straight line revenue increase and the customer term extensions it does appear it was AT&T, I know you guys you don't like to talk about individual customers. But it does appear that its AT&T based on your disclosures.","And I was wondering kind of how this term extension relates to the MLA they got signed last quarter that AT&T announced that they signed and whether this relationship between these two things. And if you can expect that this is a sort of thing that might continue or if this was more of a one off exercise?","The second one was kind of ignoring the year-over-year asymmetry in the business with the Lightower acquisition and looking more at kind of the quarter on quarter sequential progress in the fiber services business could you disaggregate that between what's kind of the small cell business growth and the enterprise services revenue growth in that fiber business? That would be helpful. Thanks.","Jay Brown","Sure. On the straight line and term extensions that you're talking about the \u2013 you're right that the supplement shows that we increased the overall term with AT&T. We're not going to talk specifically about what happened but I would just say that it doesn't mean that's the only thing that happened in the quarter.","This is related to as we signed new amendments and new leasing activity that we're getting extensions to some of those \u2013 with some of those amendments in the leasing activity.","And because of that, it is driving an increase in the straight lined revenues and then ultimately driving an increase in the term that we have with our customer. I would not necessarily tie it to the MLA one way or the other. It's just that we are getting extensions when we're signing amendments and new leases.","David Barden","Just to clarify Dan that was just more on the cadence of the business leases come up for renewal all the time and this just has happened to be more of one off exercise rather than something part of a larger picture?","Dan Schlanger","Well I think it's not necessarily a one off exercise. It's part of how we are entering in contracts with our customers. And as you can see, we expect to increase straight line revenue through the remainder of 2018.","So it's not just that, it happened once and we never expected, again. But it's the magnitude of it was such that we wanted to call out in the second quarter and then show what it does for the net remainder of 2018.","David Barden","Okay.","Jay Brown","On your second question Dave the way we've look at the business and really manages thinking about it on a year-over-year basis. And so if you disaggregate it the revenue growth from the various component from a tower standpoint I'll give you the 2017 growth numbers and compare that to 2018. So in 2017, we grew towers about $105 million. And this year, we'll do about $110 million, so up about $5 million on the towers side year-over-year.","On the small cell side, we did about $40 million of increase last year. This year we'll do about $55 million from small cells. And then last year, we did about $25 million on the fiber side.","And this year we'll do about $45 million. So as Dan mentioned, those numbers are consistent with what we talked about last quarter and really pretty consistent with what we thought going into the calendar year and the business has performed right there where we had expected it to.","David Barden","All right. Great, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Markets. ","Jonathan Atkin","Thanks. So I was interested a little bit in your small cell pipeline that you talked about that continues to grow. And how diverse is that in terms of the number of operators that you see ramping up their spend?","And then secondly my question around, I wonder if there's any sort of an update around the activities of Vapor IO? Thank you.","Jay Brown","On the first question Jonathan, we are seeing activity across all four of the major operators on small cells and we're seeing them throughout the vast majority of our fiber and small cells are in the top 25 markets and that continues. So we're seeing the vast majority of the activity there. We are starting to see some activity outside of the MSO markets and that's growing.","I think our long-term belief is that we're going to continue to see the carriers invest in needs small cell slightly through the top 25, 30 markets and into the top 50 and potentially all the way through the top 100 markets in a meaningful way.","But right now the activity is mostly focused in NFL cities and we're seeing that from all four of the operators. So there's pretty good diversity both in terms of geography as well as the carriers spend and focus there.","On the second question, I don't know that we have a lot to update on Vapor. For folks on the call who aren't familiar with that Vapor is a company that's focused on edge data centers with the very edge of the network which becomes increasingly important in low latency applications.","We made a small investment last year and it's continued to follow that. And we believe there's a tremendous opportunity as networks develop particularly around CRAN and the importance of tower sites as an important hub to the overall wireless communications networks.","We believe that over time there will be edge data centers that are there and Vapor is in that business. So it doesn't contribute anything to our revenues or EBITDA at this point, but we believe that's a long-term opportunity.","And it may result in - we certainly wouldn't have benefited and so. Long term we think there's an opportunity for site rental revenues from that business. But we're not anywhere close to putting that inside of the outlook.","Dan Schlanger","Just adding a little bit to that adding a little bit to that. I think it just further indicates how important having a dense network of fiber is because what edge data centers will ultimately do is try to as Jay was pointing out reduce latency. But in order to do that you have to them connected by fiber so things can move quickly between and among them.","And while we have that dense network of fiber there are multiple avenues to generate revenues on it. And the edge data centers just one of them. We think that the more near term ones will likely be in the small cell and the fiber solution side.","So we're so excited in what we've invested in is that, as Jay mentioned in his prepared remarks is that owning these assets opens up all of these opportunities for us. And as they come up we will - we'll continue to be I think the best position is to take advantage of them however they evolve.","Jonathan Atkin","Thank you. And just a quick follow up on the small cell tenancy levels, if you look at sort of in place infrastructure anything in the way of seeing store metrics? Any additional color you could add on to how tenancy levels are growing? Thanks.","Dan Schlanger","Sure, John. We continue to see lease up on small cells growing at about twice the rate of what we saw and have seen in towers. So the co-location activity continues to be very robust when compared to towers is very, very encouraging.","In terms of - I\u2019ve made a passing reference to this, but important to reiterate, the returns that we're seeing as we're adding that co-location does bring the yield into the double-digits exactly in line with our expectations.","And some of our older systems that have been there for a while are continuing to see that lease up over time just like what we've seen play out with towers.","What has happened at the same time that we're seeing that on the investments that we've made over time is the scale of the opportunity has continued to grow. We started off in small cells and our initial investments and really probably our initial investment thesis was that there going to be pretty a few locations in really dense urban areas where small cells were going to be needed.","And so the opportunity to put capital there at attractive returns, I would say, was also small at scale. And what we see today is not just that the returns are coming in as we expected on a small scale, but rather the opportunity is continuing to grow and our ability to win based on our expertise and experience in that market has continued to expand.","So we're both excited about the data points that we have, which points to that the business model is performing at least as well as what we had expected when we made the investments.","But I think our general excitement is that the opportunity to do that in scale is appearing in much greater scale than what we initially expected.","Jonathan Atkin","Since you have macro sites in the immediate vicinity of your small cell investments, are you noticing any impacts on the tower business in terms of growth rates?","Dan Schlanger","We're not seeing any change there. Macro sites continue to be and we believe will always be the lowest cost and most effective way to deploy the network. So to the extent that there's a macro site that can solve the challenge that the carriers have that's their low cost approach to solving that need.","But macro sites can solve all of the needs given the increase in data traffic and density of the traffic in specific areas.","So I think the best analogy is the macro sites become the overhead lights in the room and small cells become the lamps in the room, where they put a concentration of light in a specific area in order to solve a need.","And that's exactly how we're seeing the carriers to deploy these networks. The macro sites in essence become like hub sites upon which the small cells are designed in order to provision enough capacity to meet the demand.","Jonathan Atkin","Thank you.","Dan Schlanger","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","Two questions the first one is a point of clarification. Jay in your remarks, you talked about your annual dividend per share growth target of 7% to 8%, but the press release does actually introduce the term near term.","And so I just wanted to see if you could clarify whether the duration of what you think about that target has shifted at all? And then I have a follow up question.","Jay Brown","Brett, we got a couple questions last night based on that. We're not quite that sophisticated where none of us I think are yelling at this point. So we were not trying to be cute or clever in the release.","We were just trying to point to the fact that some investment stories when teams start to talk about the long-term strategic opportunities in front of them, it's a wait and see story to investors. And we don't believe that's the case with our story.","Our story is about the long-term growth opportunity that we're building by the investment in small cells, which we believe creates not just a few years worth of opportunity, but decades of opportunity just like the acquisition of towers did in the late 1990s.","And on top of that, investors don't have to wait for those investments to materialize and to exceed the cost of capital, because in the near term there's reward in the form of a growing dividend of 7% to 8%.","So I think the word we've used may be the past is foreseeable future that we expect to grow the dividend 7% to 8% for the foreseeable future and that's still the case today. Our goal in my comments in the press release was to just point out the difference between near term and long term.","And I think our model in a compelling way provides both the near term, medium term and foreseeable future return of 7% to 8% growing dividend. And at the same time, we're making investments to ensure that there's a long-term growth opportunities in our business.","Brett Feldman","Thank you for clarifying. So another question that I have is if I think about your commentary about what you're seeing in small cells, it sounds like that the opportunities that may be even bigger than it was when you initially set the target.","And the reason I'm bringing it up is that when we look at the sum total of the capital you deploy every year on your CapEx program and on your dividend, it exceeds what you organically generated fund those two uses. And so you have a funding program that you engage in every year both in the equity and the credit markets.","And so the question we've gotten is that, if the demand side which is very capital intensive were much bigger than anticipated, at a certain point you have to make a challenging decision to say we would rather prioritize revenue growth as opposed to dividend growth. Or do you think that your funding program could grow with your demand for your assets?","Dan Schlanger","The short answer is I think our funding program can grow with the demand for the assets. We have a tremendous access to capital in the market. And this is part of the reason going back to the strategy of why we initially put the dividend in place and pay out a substantial portion of our cash flow.","Our view on capital is that it's not our capital. This capital belongs to shareholders both the capital in the form of debt and equity. And we like the discipline of coming to the market when the capital investments exceed that of our cash flow.","So the vast majority of our cash flow we've returned that in the form of dividends to shareholders and then we come and make the case for why the investment makes sense to raise additional debt and equity as needed over time.","We think that's good discipline and it gives us a chance to tell the story as to why that investment opportunity is compelling and should be invested in. So we do think to your point, we do think that the opportunity is continuing to grow.","And as that opportunity grows to the extent that we need to increase the sizing of funding, we think the returns are compelling enough that investors will come alongside as they wanted to invest in that future \u2013 in that future opportunity.","So at this point, we are not in any way limiting the capital spend we're pursuing the opportunities because the returns are compelling and we believe will provide long-term growth and dividends per share which is really where we zero in on how to decide whether or not it's a worth us going out and raising debt and equity to pursue the opportunities.","Brett Feldman","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.","Ric Prentiss","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jay Brown","Good morning.","Ric Prentiss","A couple questions. First on the straight line adjustment change was that mostly on the towers side? Or is it coming on the small cell fiber?","Dan Schlanger","It was mostly on the towers side.","Ric Prentiss","Okay. And it looks like if we're right on our math that the difference kind of is more like maybe a bonus escalator structure. It looks like the cash benefit you mentioned was 0 in 2018 looks like maybe a couple million in 2019 and then more in 2020 and a lot more in over 2021, 2022. Is that the way we're kind of pushing itself out into the later years as far as the cash benefit?","Dan Schlanger","Not necessarily. Again, we're not getting into what we negotiated in terms of how the MLA works or what we're going to do specifically with customers. But generally speaking what's happening is we're signing amendments we're signing new leases assuming the term on those as we sign them and at some point though all of that will have a cash impact.","So the straight line impact of it will, as it has in the past in the near term the non-cash is greater than the cash. At some point it turns the other way, we just re-extended that and made the near term non-cash look bigger than the cash because we're extending contracts.","But I would not get into, how exactly we've structured the economics of the transaction with our customers.","Ric Prentiss","Okay. And I guess the questions we've gotten from a lot of investors was just then, was is it just a lease term extension or was there just some new business to it? It seems like there might have been some new business as well.","Dan Schlanger","New amendments and new leasing is new business. I mean, that is what we are trying to point out. This is part of the activity that were seeing that Jay was talking about earlier that we see good activity in 2018 higher than 2017. This is part of that activity. We also just get lease extension for it.","Ric Prentiss","Okay, cool. And then last question I got is the organic contributed to site rental revenues in the supplement the 5.6%. We got a lot of questions from people on can that go higher? How much higher could it go? What would it take to \u2013 could it get above 6%?","Could it get above 7%? I understand they will have large numbers. But just as you think about that 5.6% given the upbeat commentary what are the thoughts on where that could go over time?","Dan Schlanger","I think the answer to your question is yes it could go higher. It's a question of the timing of when we see activity come in and as we're investing in small cells for the timing of when we get those investments in small cells to come on air. So we could see all of that go higher. And we will be optimistic as Jay pointed out that on the small cell side that the opportunity set is growing and that we are very optimistic about what that looks like.","Having said that, though trying to compare I think a lot of the question comes from what we've heard historically that tell if you are asking something differently is can we get back to where we were sometime in 2013 or 2014 timeframe?","And that question is really hard to answer, because it's more of a question to our customers about how quickly they are going to deploy additional spectrum or densify their networks.","And while we think everything looks good and there is what we said historically we see a long runway of growth here we can't tell you exactly what the timing is of all of that and how it plays out especially in comparison to what has been historically.","Jay Brown","Ric maybe one other thing that I would add to that is, I think one of the things that missed in our model is that people try to find inflection points either to the positive or to the negative and they try to read through some of the commentary from the carriers or equipment manufacturers and try to figure out what the impact to our results in any given calendar year or the next year will be as a result of that.","And as I've made the comment in my prepared remarks I've been here for about 20 years now. And my experience has been that there's very little if ever inflection points in our business that almost in every calendar year we've fallen within a band of about 5% or 10% of leasing activity.","And so as we look at long term trends which we're really trying to talk to and highlights this morning it gives us confidence that the growth that we're seeing as we talked about kind of $110 million thereabouts in towers and $55 million on small cells and $45 million around fiber, we think the dynamics of the market and what the customers need are set up to continue to deliver that.","And so when we've underwritten and talked about kind of our 7% to 8% dividend growth per year for the foreseeable future that's really matched up to this view that within any given year, we think leasing kind of falls within a relatively close band and inflection points are less - are frankly less likely.","So I would encourage folks to say look at our story to not to try to pick an inflection point and certainly don't try to look for those in any given quarterly results, but take a longer view.","And our view is that the runway of growth here has really been extended much more so than any near term inflection point that might happen on our results.","Ric Prentiss","That\u2019s really helpful. Obviously a great business, long term sustainable business. Appreciate that color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick","Hey guys. Thanks for those broken out unit growth numbers. Can you break out CapEx the same way for us?","Dan Schlanger","Yes. We'll say that it's hard to break out CapEx because the underlying asset is the same asset. So the majority of our CapEx is on the fiber, and so there's probably close to $1.5 billion of our CapEx on the fiber side and about $400 million, $500 million on the towers side.","But breaking it out between fiber solutions and small cells really doesn't make sense because it's the same asset being deployed to try to get all of those revenue streams. And as Jay was pointing out earlier in the prepared remarks, really the multiple tenancy is what drives the business.","And why we're so excited about it is that we do have the opportunity to add those different revenue streams to a similar asset mix.","Philip Cusick","Okay. Can you talk about the fiber business? What's the latest with management there? And the first and second quarters were pretty strong for e-rate for a number of people. Do you see anything similar?","Dan Schlanger","Yes sure. On the light I'm assuming you're referring to the Lightower management team. We did not it's just a reminder we did not model any synergies in that acquisition in terms of cost synergies.","And I think our - as I've talked about before we have a great deal of respect for what the team had built and accomplished. And the team of more than 900 people at Lightower is really to be commended for how well they've built that business and we've certainly been the beneficiary of watching them continue to run that business and they're off to a great start as they've joined the Crown team.","And as I mentioned earlier, Phil, we're planning to use their platform their expertise and their leadership to really continue to grow the platform and expand it beyond the markets that we're currently in as we grow the tenancy across multiple places that we on the fiber.","We had a handful of their executive team that told us they wanted to move on. And so - and they have, but they did a great job of having successors in most cases ready for those positions.","And so for the most part, we've had people internally who've been with Lightower for a long period of time including in the sales role and finance role who have stepped up and taken those roles and have done a terrific job.","And then we went outside and found somebody with a tremendous amount of operating experience and brought them in that have been at Verizon and Google and Frontier most recently on the operating side in order to beef up our operating expertise.","So the team has done an incredible job and they're really to be commended for, how well they've done. And we're really excited about what the opportunity is ahead.","Jay Brown","Yes. And we talked about Phil, this is a bit of a complex integration because we're trying to get integrate all the fiber assets we have bought previously in the Lightower and Lightower and the Crown Castle. And as Jay mentioned, it's gone as well as we could have expected and the team really should be commended.","That is a difficult thing to get done and still deliver on the business plan that we laid out at the beginning of the year. And for all of that to be going as well as it is, I think we're excited about it and optimistic about the future.","Philip Cusick","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Niknam","Hey, guys, thank you for taking the question. Just two if I could. One, are there any updates you can share in terms of the pacing of activity or cadence of activity from Sprint and T-Mobile?","And then as mentioned before, I know you don't really comment about specific customers, but curious in light of the merger announcement whether you\u2019ve seen any of using a short of change in activity or pacing since the deal was announced?","And then secondly just following up on the small cell investments, I think, Dan right now you're sitting at about five turns of leverage. Just wondering if there's any change in the way you think about target leverage and effectively funding these investments between debt and potential equity? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Matt, on your first question you sort of answered it in your question. I'm not going to comment specifically about T-Mobile and Sprint what their activity is. I'd refer you to them. I'd go back to the comments that we made around both towers and small cells.","In the case of towers, our expectation going into the year and that still is the case today, we expect to grow tower revenues of about $110 million this year compared to about $105 million last year. So up about $5 million and that's held consistent both before and after the deal and over the course of this year.","And then on the small cell side, last year we grew revenues about $40 million. This year we see about $55 million of contribution from small cells and that's been consistent since the end of last year.","So it's going up to high level. We haven't seen any change in the activity over the course of the year. So we feel pretty good about where we are going into the second half of the year.","Dan Schlanger","Yes. And on your second question around leverage target, our target is still around five times, we ended the quarter around 5.2 times. We believe that the growth in EBITDA over the back half of the year will get us down to that 5 times.","And that when we did our equity offering earlier in this year, we had known about what the small cell investments are going to be in size and appropriately to try to make sure that we had the capital locked in to invest at the rates that we knew we could - would match the economics that we had run in our models.","And we still believe that's the case. Going forward, depending on what that investment profile looks like, we will be out as Jay pointed out accessing debt and equity capital markets over the course of whatever that debt investment profile looks like going forward to try to maintain that investment grade rating that we have around in the five times leverage position.","Matthew Niknam","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski","Good morning and thanks very much for taking the questions. One of the things that I loved to touch upon is in looking at sort of what the FCC is planning in terms of upcoming spectrum auctions, it seems as though the cadence of the embrace of the industry for millimeter wave spectrum and higher band spectrum has improved versus where it was a couple of years ago.","What has been your experience in supporting some of those current deployments? And how should we think about the opportunity set for you folks going forward? Is this more of a small cell opportunity, macro site opportunity? How are you thinking about that opportunity set?","Jay Brown","Good morning, Amir. I would look at this as we have looked at in many of the options in the past the FCC has gone down the path. There are two things that are really critical in order for us to benefit from. Curious need to have spectrum available and they have to need capital to deploy that spectrum.","And millimeter wave in some of the other auctions that are on the drawing board at this point being talked about would represent an opportunity for additional spectrum to get into the hands of operators and our hope would be they end up in the head of operators who have the capital to ultimately deploy them.","Specifically to your question around millimeter wave I think the opportunity set there is a combination of both macro sites and small cells. Given the distance that that's going to travel it's likely that the benefit probably goes a little bit more towards small cells than it would macro sites.","But ultimately, those business models have to develop and we have to see what it's going to look like and what it's going to be used for in order to answer that question with a lot of precision.","But I think generally, we would think that that's likely to the benefit of small cells to a greater degree of macro sites, if you're specifically just looking at millimeter way.","Amir Rozwadowski","Great. That's very helpful. And then, one of the things that you guys had mentioned in the past is that there's a bit more of a preference today of building out fiber assets versus acquiring additional fiber assets, because of the asset quality that you're looking to deploy.","If we think about that whether that's the reach breadth of the fiber or the strands per line how do you believe that that will play out in terms of a competitive differentiator going forward.","It does seem as though you're getting more and more opportunities for co-location as you mentioned sort of returns have been better than expected. So really trying to think about, if we fast forward a couple of years, do you believe that that ultimately will prove to be a competitive differentiator for the fiber business?","Jay Brown","Yes. Two things come to mind. First of all, one of the strict investment criteria that we've looked at is we want the fiber that we acquire to be dense, urban high capacity fiber.","And as we look at the universe of opportunities, as we've mentioned in several occasions and you've referenced in your question, we really don't see a large opportunity set in the market to acquire. There are some markets were maybe we can find a tuck-in acquisition or two.","But we don't see a large opportunity set there to go out and acquire it, so which means that as we think about the growth in the business and opportunities that we we're talking about we believe most of that fiber will be a result of fiber that we've built organically and construct over time.","And I think the opportunity there is going to be, as I mentioned earlier in my comments in markets that go beyond just kind of the top 25 markets.","As I think about the competitive dynamic there, the opportunity just like it's been in towers obviously the department cycle as long as we talked about 18 months to 24 months to deploy small cells a long cycle to deploy fiber and there's a limited aspect of it in the market today.","So there's a real benefit to the customer of sharing that infrastructure. And I don't see any scenario where the cost to construct comes down dramatically from where it is today such that the shared model is not the lowest cost alternative. So our job day-in and day-out here at Crown Castle is to provide infrastructure at a much lower cost to our customers than what they could do on their own.","And I don't see anything in either the near term or the long-term that really changes that dynamic. So taking an asset that has an enormous amount of value and then bringing it to customers with solutions that offer them a much lower cost than what constructing it themselves would be I think is a path to success for us that will be sustainable over a long period.","Dan Schlanger","And to your competitive dynamic point, I think we have focused on that dense high capacity urban fiber in the top markets, because we do believe that having that capacity early on will position us best to get the most out of the market going forward.","And we think that we are in a very good competitive position, because we do have fiber assets in 23 of the top 25 markets. And as Jay pointed out, we think they will continue to expand.","But we see a lot of benefit for being the first mover in those markets and having the expertise that we have to deliver small cells on that fiber. So we feel good about where that \u2013 how that positions us competitively in those markets and then going forward.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks very much for the incremental color.","Dan Schlanger","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael","Great. Thank you. Two if I may. First one, you talked a lot about how you're seeing all four carriers spending heavily now on small cells. And I just wanted to go back to small cells versus macro in terms of the spend. I appreciate you said that they need both in use the Light example to show that.","But when you think of the incremental spend in terms of dollars are you seeing more of a shifting to small and I would assume that at the expense of macro towers? Because from my understanding or just looking at the CapEx budgets of the carriers they're still holding back on raising their actual CapEx budget.","So it would just seem natural to assume then that if they're spending more on small cells they're spending less on macros incremental go forward basis despite I would agree to the fact that they need both longer term. I'm just trying to get some color on that.","And secondly, just from a modeling perspective network services revenue again was low. I know you commented and mentioned in the press release that that will go up.","But I was wondering, if you can just give us any color there particularly around I think it was network services with fiber it's been down the last two quarters results what we saw in 2017.","And are you positioned to give us some color what total network services revenue should be for 2018? Thank you.","Jay Brown","Sure, Colby. On your first question around small cells versus macro sites, the incremental spend from the carriers, I obviously I can't speak across the entire industry. So I can really only speak to what we've seen with our assets.","The spend on macro sites is up year-over-year when compared to 2017 and 2017 was up from 2016. So at least with regard to the 40000 towers that we have those were largely predominantly focused in the top 100 markets in the US.","The carriers spend and the investment in macro sites to further improve their networks has actually grown over the last several years. We're not seeing anything that would suggest that that dynamic is going to change.","At the same time, the carriers have obviously significantly increased the amount of spend that they're having in small cells. So the growth rates there over the last several years are well in excess of the growth rates that we've seen on macro sites.","So I don't know that it's to the detriment of towers because towers have continued to grow, but it is a fair point that there has been a meaningful allocation of their capital dollars and network improvement focus that is going to small cells.","And we think that that focus on small cells is going to continue to increase particularly geographically and density wise in the markets that they've already deployed those.","Dan Schlanger","Yes. And Colby I'll take on your second question on the services. We don't guide specifically to services, so I won't tell you exactly what it is. But clearly we think the second half is going to be bigger than the first half. It really is the only way that you can get into the EBITDA guidance that we have given.","So the second quarter reduction in services we do think it's just timing and it is pushing out into the second half of the year. And I don't know exactly under fiber side there's very little service revenue associated with the fiber side, so that may bounce around here and there. But I wouldn't take trends out of that just because of the small sample set.","Colby Synesael","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk","Thanks. Hey Jay, I want to go back to your answers to Ric's last question in terms of trying to figure out inflection points. I mean I think it was North Carolina you were talking about maybe the industry to a point of adding a couple hundred thousand small cells a year.","Just got up and go where now I think you just as a company are probably having 10000 to 15000 range with whatever market share you got. So we look at that and then you hear Verizon talk very aggressively about small cells as a capacity solution then you look at the radius of the small cell and you apply that to the 15000 at your market share and then the square mileage that's just in the top 20 markets.","And then we kind of factor in what you talked about in terms of 12 to 18 month time frame or 18 to 24 month time frame. So it seems like a kind of put all these things together if Verizon is actually doing what they're saying they're doing in terms of a really aggressive fiber build then you're going to have that visibility to let us know when that inflection point is.","So if we look at your small cells this year, 55 new versus 40 last year doesn't necessarily show the inflection point, but maybe can give us a better sense of when that inflection point is going to hit based on what Verizon has been saying in terms of the aggression and using densification for their capacity needs?","Jay Brown","Yes, Walt. I guess we're sitting here in July of 2018. So I'm not going to give you 2019 and 2020 guidance. But your point is well taken and all of the comments that I've been trying to make this morning and Dan echoed in some of his comments is that the opportunity set is certainly growing.","And we are - we believe based on what we've seen thus far the returns that we've seen it would suggest that as Verizon and other carriers, I don't want to just single out Verizon in this conversation, although, they have been very public and very bullish in terms of what the opportunity is.","I believe that's true for all of the carriers and the need is there for all of the carriers and all of them are using a small cells and that opportunity set is continuing to grow. And given the returns that we see in the business we want to continue to pursue that.","So I'm not at a place this morning where I want to give specific numbers around how much we think will capture and what that revenue growth will be like in future years. But it is fair to say that that's the trajectory there is towards higher levels of activity than what we've seen in the last couple of years around small cells.","The inflection point that I'm really trying to make is that's a trajectory of growth that could be sustainable over a period of time. The point I was trying to make in Rick's comment was more towards the changes that happened quarter-to-quarter are generally not nearly as pronounced as the market tends to fear they are or believed to the positive they're going to impact numbers.","They\u2019re tends to be a much longer smoother curve than kind of the volatile inflection point that sometimes are looked for in our business model.","Walter Piecyk","Understood. I guess it is difficult for all of us given what Verizon has said that we're thinking there is going to be quarter-to-quarter lift and it never seems to happen. My second question is on prepaid. Is the expectation that prepaid is going to increase - the prepaid rent is going to increase $40 million.","I think the way you described this in the past is it will increase the same this year as it did last year and I think that equated to $40 million. Is that still the number for 2018?","Jay Brown","Yes. That's still the number for 2018. Just to be fulsome about that though we also added from Lightower acquisition an additional $40 million on top of that. So it looks like $80 million in total, but the number you're trying to isolate is how much the prepaid rent grow on the business, it was about \u2013 yes, it's about $40 million this year.","Walter Piecyk","And most of that is going to be in the fiber business, right? So if we look at the 55 and the 45 that substantially most of that 40 or let's call it 30 is going to be in the fiber\/small cell business, right? So the true new leasing activity would basically be the 100 minus that 30 or 40 from prepaid?","Jay Brown","It will be in the fiber business. I think that's all true leasing activity, but it is the majority of that $40 million will be in the fiber business, yes.","Walter Piecyk","Got it. Thank you very much.","Jay Brown","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.","Spencer Kurn","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on the commentary around the services ramp - the network services ramp for the back half of the year. Your guidance implies a really sharp sequential increase in the fourth quarter.","Should we look at that as sort of leading or coincide all indicator of leasing activity or is that just simply the timing of how it flowed in this year?","Jay Brown","It's both the timing of how it flowed in this year. And this generally what we see in the business as the fourth quarter is a high quarter in terms of services. So it's something that we've seen historically and we expect to happen this year.","In terms of the second question is, can you look through that and try to find an indicator of what the new leasing activity is? It's not really a one for one type of correlation there.","So I wouldn't take it necessarily that is an indicator that things are changing or not, it's just the way that the timing of the services revenue is coming into 2018 is a big sequential jump in the fourth quarter.","Spencer Kurn","Got it. And just one more question if I may. We keep hearing that backlog in activity levels are rising, but it hasn't really flown through to organically seeing revenue growth in a material way this year.","Could you just provide a little bit of context on how your backlog as it stands today compare relative to prior years? And how that sort of - how the backlog is trending overall?","Jay Brown","Sure. Spencer, maybe going up to really high level on that question. From a tower standpoint, typically when we get an application from the time we get an application to when we get on air that revenue stream depending on whether it's an amendment or are new ways, it's somewhere between about three to five months and as long as about nine to 12 months. That's true on the tower side.","On the small cell side which is we've spent the last several quarters talking more about the backlog there that's generally an 18 month to 24 month cycle from the time that we have the commitment until the time the small cell fiber is built and we're then on air and generating revenue.","I wouldn't dismiss though the growth that we saw. I mean going from $40 million to $55 million is a significant growth rate in the organic revenue. Now admittedly this activity in 2018 correlates all the way back to activity that in many cases was signed during calendar year 2016.","And we've made comments publicly in multiple occasions that in the first quarter of 2018 we signed it many nodes, contracted nodes of new bookings in that first quarter as we did in all of calendar year 2016.","So that portends activity that is 18 months to 24 months from now. And as we continue to do that activity in bookings we're continuing to kind of - sort of push that cycle out another 18 months to 24 months.","So we have good visibility in terms of what's [Indiscernible] results. You can see the benefit of the last couple of years of activity that we've seen and we signed up and that's already starting to generate revenue and cash flows in line with what we had expected.","Spencer Kurn","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi","Great. Thank you. Just a few follow ups. First on Lightower. Can you provide more color on the trends that you're seeing from demand from the enterprise segments? And if there's any change in the trend that you had expected?","And also just SG&A has gone up to about 9% of revenues, how should we think about that on an ongoing basis? Thank you.","Jay Brown","On your first question, we continue to see great activity in line with what we expected from enterprise clients. As I made comments earlier in the call, we think we're going to continue to grow that business, not just in the markets that we're in currently, but in markets beyond those markets as we utilize fiber that today is in locations that would be very attractive for enterprises and large hospitals, government universities et cetera.","And we're in the process of continuing to pursue that. But Lightower is tracking where we had expected. As we've talked about in the past, we expect churn in the high single digits there and then that's basically been our experience over time and it's playing out there.","So we have been changed our expectation there and things that has performed basically in line with what we expected.","Dan Schlanger","And on your second question Batya on SG&A. We have increased SG&A as we have invested in productive capacity of our business particularly around small cells. So as we've talked about and the question that was just asked by Spencer a second ago is what does the growth look like.","While we were a couple of years, ago a few years ago in the position of putting on 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 small cells per year now we're in a position on putting on somewhere 10,000 and 15,000 small cells per year and that takes investment.","And that's why it is growing and why we are so actually - we are excited about that growth because it's allowing us to achieve the strategic goal that we're looking forward to positioning our company to take advantage of what small cell growth going forward.","From here we think that we are in that 10,000 to 15,000 small cell nodes per year range and that's about where our backlog would dictate us to be. And therefore, we feel like we're in the right spot. To the extent that we grow even more we may have to even invest more in SG&A.","But again we think that would be a good news story because that would just say that overall market is growing substantially and it's something that we would be looking out to try to take advantage of.","So our historical investments have gotten us this far and we think that going forward we can stay where we are or pretty close to it. But to the extent that we get more activity levels we might need to invest more in our business.","Batya Levi","And you had also mentioned that you didn't include any synergies from these acquisitions. So could there be some relief on that going forward?","Jay Brown","Batya I don't see as cutting our way to growth in the business. So I think we're more likely to be hiring individuals and growing the business rather than finding cost synergies.","The opportunity here around revenue synergies and growing revenues from both small cells and the enterprise business that you asked about and other solutions there we think is enormous.","And so we're going to - if it plays out the way we believe, we're much more likely to be talking about additional revenue synergies rather than finding cost synergy.","Batya Levi","Got it. Thank you.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Partners.","Robert Gutman","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You're taking a $33 million charge next quarter according to guidance for retirement of long-term obligations at $107 million for the year. I just want to make sure does that refer to, is that based on debt refinancing? Or does that refer to asset retirement obligations?","Dan Schlanger","Those are the debt refinancing costs that were incurred by extending the maturities that we've talked about.","Robert Gutman","Okay. That's all I had. Thanks.","Dan Schlanger","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Tim Horan","Thanks, guys. Jay, could you just maybe give the backlog on the fiber business either the dollar amount or small cell? And how it compared to a year ago? Because I mean, all your comments or implying that we are seeing an acceleration of revenue growth next year and year after I know you're not looking to give specific guidance.","But your commentary around, how strong the bookings have been which kind of suggest that, just any more color I think that's what everyone's kind of asking at the end of the day? And I just had a quick follow up.","Jay Brown","Yes, Tim. Again I don't want to get into giving specific guidance for 2019 and 2020. I think this is why the conversation is so helpful for us to put the target out there in terms of what we think the dividend growth is going to be 7% to 8%.","And we believe on an annual basis of growth of dividends per share, we believe we can achieve that dividend growth per share on an annual basis inclusive of the cost of the capital associated with the growing opportunity that we're seeing.","So that extending the long-term growth and I think the best way to think about it in the current term and in the coming years is to think about and expect from us that we'll be able to grow the dividend 7% to 8% on an annual basis.","And then as we get closer to kind of events where we're starting to recognize the revenue I think we'll be a little clearer on what opportunity is. And as we have in the past good news as we sit here in July is you're only a few months away from us giving our 2019 outlook which we typically do in October and our planning on doing that again this year as we have done in the past. So we'll update you in October and what we're seeing for 2019.","Tim Horan","And then just lastly I know we touched on this. But clearly it makes a lot more sense to share infrastructure. But Verizon seems to be wanting to build out a lot more of their own and to a degree AT&T.","Verizon is passing optical technology. That looks like we'll try to converge wireline and wireless networks together. I guess the question is do you think that you've totally convinced the carriers that it makes a lot more sense to outsource?","And it would seem to make financial sense but may be is there a point using some new passive optical technologies or really integrating wireless or wireline in ways that it makes more sense for them to do themselves? Thanks.","Jay Brown","I think you're going to see all of the carriers build some components of their needed small cell networks themselves. And we certainly don't believe while we're the clear leader at the moment and believe that we're best positioned to capture significant opportunities in the future.","I certainly don't believe we're going to capture anywhere close to 100% of those opportunities. And the model that we've underwritten and are pursuing does not assume that we capture anywhere close to 100% of the opportunities.","So I think you will continue to see the carriers invest in their own small cells and deploy them themselves. I think you also have other infrastructure providers who enter the space as the market continues to develop the omni top 25 markets and beyond the NFL cities, as I was making the point earlier.","I think it's likely that you'll see other folks who see the returns that we've been able to achieve and want to invest and enter that business as a third party infrastructure. I would agree with the part of your question where you note the convergence of wireless and wireline and it's fundamental frankly to our investment thesis that there's a real convergence going on between wireless and wireline.","And an integral part of that convergent is for fiber. And our investments have positioned us both in terms of the tower investments that we've made as well as the more recent fiber investments that we've made have really positioned us at the very leading edge of that convergence and what next generation communication networks are going to look like.","So we believe the opportunity here at Crown Castle is compelling because it's the opportunity to not only get the benefit of the really long term growth and opportunity that's there but also get a benefit on an annual basis of growing the dividend 7% to 8%. So appreciate the questions. Great way to end the call.","Tim Horan","Thank you.","Operator","At this time speakers we have no more questions. I'll turn them back to you for closing remarks. ","Jay Brown","Okay. Thanks everyone for joining the call this morning. We look forward to talking to you in the coming days.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.+"],"6112":["Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 24, 2013 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Fiona McKone - Vice President of Finance","Jay A.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, January 24, 2013. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Fiona McKone, Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.","Fiona McKone","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us as we review our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results. With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.","To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will discuss throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements and information based on management's current expectations.

Brown","Thanks, Fiona, and good morning, everyone. We had an excellent 2012. In addition to delivering very strong results, we achieved several significant accomplishments during the year, as shown on Slide 3. We've completed $4 billion of acquisitions, including the T-Mobile tower transaction, which increased our tower count to over 30,000; the acquisition of NextG Networks, the leading provider of distributed antenna systems; and the acquisition of 2,300 ground lease related assets from Wireless Capital Partners.","These transactions position us as the largest infrastructure provider in the U.S., with approximately 22,000 towers in the top 100 markets and extensive small-cell operations in over 50 markets, with a concentration in the top urban locations where leasing activity is the highest.","Further, these transactions reinforce our strategic objective of being the leader in shared wireless infrastructure in the U.S., which we believe is the fastest-growing and most profitable wireless market in the world. We believe that these transactions will be accretive to our long-term growth rates and enhancing the shareholder value.","Additionally, during the year, we completed more than $7 billion in financing activities to refinance existing debt and fund the aforementioned acquisition. These financings lowered our average cost of debt by 170 basis points to 4.5% and extended the average maturity to approximately 7 years.","Further, in March 2012, we were pleased to be added to the S&P 500 Index.","In addition to these meaningful events, we consistently delivered strong results above our original expectations. For the full year, we grew site rental revenue by 15%, adjusted EBITDA by 19% and adjusted funds from operations by 20% compared to 2011. These results were considerably above our expectations at the beginning of 2012.","Further, our services business continued to outperform our expectations, delivering strong growth in 2012 as we continue to work very hard to meet customer deployment objectives and facilitate customers' installations on our sites. Similar to the results for the full year 2012, we achieved strong growth in the fourth quarter results, as shown on Slide 4.","During the fourth quarter, we generated site rental revenue of $570 million, up 21% from the fourth quarter of 2011. This 21% growth was comprised of approximately 6% from new tenant addition, reflecting the increased leasing activity driven by the 4 major carriers upgrading their networks; 12% from acquisitions, including NextG and 1 month of site rental revenue from the T-Mobile towers that closed on November 30; and approximately 2% from our existing base of business, from contracted renewals and contracted escalators net of churn. Further, we had approximately $5 million of non-recurring items in the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to about $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenues less cost of operations, was $421 million, up 20% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $414 million, up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2011.","AFFO was $243 million, up 26% from the fourth quarter of 2011, as shown on Slide 5. And importantly, AFFO per share was $0.83, up 22% from the fourth quarter of 2011.","Turning to Slide 6, pro forma for the T-Mobile tower transaction and refinancing. We ended 2012 with total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately 6.3x and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense of approximately 3.4x. Our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio and cash interest expense coverage ratio are comfortably within their respective debt covenant requirements.","Further, we completed a number of meaningful financings during the fourth quarter. We closed on a $1.65 billion senior notes offering at the holding company, with an interest rate of 5.25% per annum, the proceeds of which, together with cash on hand and drawings under our revolving credit facility, were used to pay for the T-Mobile tower transaction. These notes mature in 2023.","In December, we closed on a $1.5 billion senior secured notes offering at one of our subsidiaries. This was comprised of $1 billion of senior secured notes due in 2023 and $500 million of senior secured notes due in 2017, with a blended interest rate of 3.4%. The proceeds of these notes, together with a portion of the revolver, were used to tender and redeem in full $830 million of 9% notes and $965 million of 7.75% notes, saving $85 million of cash interest expense per year. Also, in December 2012, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility by $500 million to $1.5 billion, of which $1.3 billion is currently drawn.","During the fourth quarter, as illustrated on Slide 7, we invested $158 million on capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $47 million on our land lease purchase program, which continues to perform very well as we work to extend the ground lease maturity and ground ownership of the land beneath our towers. In total, during 2012, we extended over 1,000 land leases and purchased land beneath more than 400 of our towers. As of today, we own or control, for more than 20 years, the land beneath towers representing approximately 75% of our gross margin. In fact, 36% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on the land that we own.","Further, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 32 years. Having completed over 13,000 land transactions, we believe this activity has resulted in the most secure land position in the industry, based on land ownership and final ground lease expiration. Our team is doing a great job on this important endeavor as we remain focused on achieving the long-term benefits of protecting our margins and controlling our largest operating expense.","Of the remaining capital expenditures, we spent $18 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $93 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures. the latter consisting of $51 million on existing sites and $41 million on the construction of new sites, primarily small-cell construction activities. Sustaining capital expenditures in the fourth quarter was higher than the third quarter by approximately $10 million, primarily due to an IT upgrade that we did throughout the company and some structural-related activities that are typically higher in the fourth quarter.","For the full year 2012, as shown on Slide 8 and 9 of the presentation, site rental revenues were approximately $2.1 billion, up 15% from 2011. This 15% growth was comprised of the following: approximately 6% from tenant equipment added to our sites, reflecting the strong leasing activity we enjoyed in 2012; 7% from acquisitions; and approximately 2% from contracted escalators and renewal of tenant leases, net of churn, on our existing base of business that was in place at the beginning of 2012. Site rental gross margin grew 16% from 2011 to $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for 2012 was $1.6 billion, up 19% from 2011. And AFFO per share increased 18% from 2011 to $3.04 for the full year 2012.","Moving to the 2013 outlook, our expectations for growth in our base business remain unchanged from the 2013 outlook we provided last October. We have updated our 2013 expectations for the T-Mobile tower transaction and the refinancing activities that I previously mentioned. For the first quarter 2013, as shown on Slide 10, we expect site rental revenue of between $605 million and $610 million, and AFFO of between $259 million and $264 million for the first quarter 2013.","The sequential growth in site rental revenue from Q4 2012 to Q1 2013 includes the benefit of approximately 41 -- $44 million of additional site rental revenue from the T-Mobile towers, offset by approximately $5 million in non-recurring items that positively impacted the fourth quarter of 2012.","Turning to Slide 11, our full year 2013 outlook has been revised to reflect the expected impact from the T-Mobile tower transaction, together with the impact of recent financings we completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect site rental revenue growth in 2013 of approximately $330 million, or 16%, over 2012. Of this amount, we expect approximately $270 million to come from acquisitions.","The balance of the year-over-year growth reflects our expectation of leasing activity to be similar to historical levels, with a significant portion of this activity already reflected in the run rate of site rental revenue, as a result of our previously disclosed agreements with the 4 major carriers relating to 4G\/LTE amendment activity.","With regard to services, we are expecting approximately the same contribution to gross margin as we achieved in 2012. We expect 2013 AFFO per share to increase by approximately 21% to $3.68 per share.","As shown on Slide 12, during 2013, we expect to generate over $1 billion of AFFO and invest approximately $400 million to $450 million on capital expenditures related to the purchases of land beneath our towers, the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites, including small cells.","In summary, we are experiencing tremendous growth in our business. In fact, the compounded annual growth rate of AFFO per share from 2010, through our expectations for 2013, is in excess of 18%. Importantly, we have been able to produce this growth while positioning ourselves for future growth, without increasing the risk profile of our site rental revenues. We believe our results reflect the value of the disciplined investments we've made over a long period of time through share purchases and U.S. acquisitions and the industry-leading customer service we provide. We had a terrific 2012, with a number of significant accomplishments. And I'm very excited about 2013, as we continue to execute around our core business and integrate these important acquisitions.","With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Thanks, Jay, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning. I want to take a couple of minutes and reflect on the tremendous year we had on a number of fronts. As Jay just mentioned, we delivered excellent financial results for 2012, and we acted intentionally to significantly enhance our portfolio through key acquisitions that should increase our growth prospects for years to come.","Today, with over 30,000 towers and over 10,000 small-cell nodes in the U.S., and a presence in 98 of the top 100 markets, we are the leading provider of shared wireless infrastructure in the U.S., facilitating wireless carrier mobile broadband deployment.","In addition to a strong year of site leasing, our U.S. services business performed exceptionally well as we continue to capture more of the revenue opportunities associated with assisting our customers in locating or upgrading installations on our sites. This increase in services activity reflects the unprecedented activity we are seeing from all 4 major carriers as they upgrade to LTE, and it is attributable to the confidence our customers have shown in Crown Castle, as regularly expressed in our customer surveys that consistently rank us as delivering the highest customer service in the industry.","During 2012, we invested $4 billion in acquisitions -- quite a year -- bolstering our premier portfolio of wireless infrastructure assets in the U.S., with 7,100 additional towers to the T-Mobile tower transaction. And following the NextG Networks acquisition, we are now the largest independent small-cell operator in the U.S.","Small cells are increasingly important as the rapid growth in mobile traffic and data demands shifts to low-mobility locations requiring wireless operators to bridge the gap between capacity and demand. Both the T-Mobile and the NextG portfolios are urban-centric, complimenting the location of our existing portfolio in the top 100 markets, which is where the wireless traffic is heaviest and where carriers traditionally focus their efforts on deploying new technologies and upgrades to existing technologies such as the current LTE upgrade.","Finally, we expect that our acquisition of ground lease related assets from WCP, which relate predominately to third-party towers, will allow us to apply the expertise we have gained as the industry leader in land lease extensions and purchases. Integration of the T-Mobile towers is underway and proceeding well, and I would like to extend my appreciation to the staff at Crown Castle and T-Mobile, who are assisting us with an orderly transition on those sites.","As evidenced by our recent domestic acquisitions, we remain firmly convinced that the U.S. market, the largest and fastest-growing wireless market in the world, has significant growth potential, with increasing smartphone and tablet penetration, growth of multiple subscriptions and where the ability of wireless carriers to make profitable investment is most apparent and the barriers to entry remain high.","As I look out into 2013 and beyond, I'm as excited about the prospects for our business as any time in memory, based on our ability to deliver the compelling economics of shared wireless infrastructure across this expanded platform. This is an unprecedented time in our industry, with all 4 major carriers actively upgrading their 4G networks, which is driving significant revenue growth on our sites.","Further, the expanding LTE networks are expected to accelerate the growth of computing devices, including smartphone and tablets, over the next several years, and it is the wealth of such devices that is the major driver for mobile data traffic growth and wireless data revenue. According to CTIA's semiannual survey, the consumption of data continues unabated as Americans consumed more than 1.1 trillion megabytes of data from June 2011 to June 2012, which is more than double the previous year, according to CTIA.","The survey also revealed that smartphone adoption continues to grow impressively. As of June 2012, smartphones made up 131 million, or 41%, of the embedded wireless connections, and up 37% from a year ago. And the number of wireless-enabled tablets, laptops and modems was up 42% year-over-year.","Further, mobile Internet usage is already beginning to displace PC usage, and the U.S. is leading this trend. It is expected that by 2015, there will be more consumers accessing the Internet through mobile devices than through PCs. These figures illustrate Americans' growing appetite for more mobile data and the utility that it provides. And we provide the essential shared infrastructure and services that assist our company -- our customers in meeting these challenges and facilitate the execution of their network deployment plans. To that end, I believe the growth we are currently experiencing is an early indicator of the important and increasing role our assets and capabilities will play in enabling wireless carriers to meet the mobile broadband demand of consumers.","So to wrap up and go to questions, we are delighted with the 2012 results and the 2013 outlook of 21% AFFO per share growth. And I believe they demonstrate the quality of our assets and our ability to execute for customers. To that end, I want to take this opportunity to thank all the men and women of Crown Castle who have worked very hard to make our goals a reality.","With that, operator, I'd like to turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just some -- a question here on the guidance. If I look at the fourth quarter, your SG&A kicked up a notch. I was hoping you can give us a little color on that. And then what's the level of SG&A you're anticipating in your guidance for 2013?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. So Brett, there's a -- you're right, and some of the numbers, Fiona can walk you through. But generally, year-over-year, and most of all of it is in the fourth quarter run rate. We'll see about a $20 million increase not only in G&A. It's evenly split between G&A and above-the-line tower costs to goods sold and basically indirects, which represents the staff and resources we are adding to really handle the LTE activity we're seeing, the services level activity we're seeing. We've added resources in the DAS, small-cell business as you can -- as we have mentioned before. And then with -- and then some modest increase from the T-Mobile acquisition. So the run rate is largely already stepped as we sit here in January of 2013. But on a year-over-year basis, it looks to me about -- right about $20 million, total. And that's about evenly split. Again, about $10 million on G&A and about $10 million above the line.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And so if your run rate in G&A is going to kind of persist in, say, the first quarter, that would imply that you also expect an above-run-rate contribution from your services business earlier in the year, even though on an annual basis, it's probably going to be flat. Is that the right interpretation?","Jay A. Brown","That's right.","W. Benjamin Moreland","That's right, yes.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just to get back to the comment that Jay made earlier, he was talking about how -- because of the -- essentially the master lease agreements you have, so much of your revenue is kind of baked into the run rate. So I'm just curious, like how sensitive is your guidance this year to the actual level of leasing activity going on in the market in light of those master lease agreements?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Let me frame that for you a little bit. When you think about new leasing activity, as we all work on every day around here, the financial or GAAP revenue reality is about half of that activity is pre-sold, and about half of that is new revenue in the year. Okay? So roughly evenly split. And let me give you a little window into what we see. Among the half that is not pre-sold, i.e., new revenue growth that would come on to the GAAP statements this year, among that half that's not pre-sold, we can already see in the pipeline about 70% of the volume we expect for the year. So we're really optimistic about the year. Now it's January 24. And as Jay mentioned, we didn't raise guidance beyond the financing and the T-Mobile acquisition because it's so early in the year. But it's encouraging that we can see in the pipeline 70% of the application volume that we expect among that half that's not pre-sold. So let's hope that continues and we see continued activity, and you could certainly see increases throughout the year. But we'll just have to see.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple questions, maybe first on capital spending, if you could just maybe walk through different line items. I think one in particular that was a little bit higher than we had expected was the Tower Improvement line. So help us think through what's going on there. And as part of that, just sort of initial augmentations on the T-Mobile towers and how you would think about that in 2013? And then maybe just one on sort of granularity. The non-cash revenues were down fairly significantly quarter-over-quarter. Maybe just some sort of help on what's going on there?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On the first question around capital spending, we saw an increase in the fourth quarter, both on land purchases. Obviously, some of the changes that happened, and expected changes that were happening with the tax codes, caused some people to want to sell properties earlier than maybe they otherwise would have. So we benefited from that and increased the spend that we would have on land purchases during the fourth quarter. And then the amount of activity, as Ben alluded to in his comments, that we're seeing from the carriers, is driving a lot of tenant adds to our sites. So we saw an increase in spending there. And usually, there's a push, as there was in this past period. Usually, there's a push in the fourth quarter, and we certainly saw that. We certainly saw that this fourth quarter. I think as we think about the full year 2013, as I alluded to in my comments, from a CapEx standpoint, we'll probably end up spending about $150 million related to the land lease extension program as we purchase land. We'll spend probably another $150-or-so million related to construction of new sites, which would include and would be mostly comprised of small-cell-related activities. And then probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million, or a little over $100 million on adding additional tenants to existing, either towers or DAS systems. And as we think about what we think we'll spent on T-Mobile, obviously, that activity around spend is completely tied to leasing activity. And in terms of the structural capacity and ability to do that, we think those assets, in terms of the cost to add additional tenants, will look very similar to our existing portfolio. So I think it will largely just be determined by what does leasing activity as we go through the course of the year look like. But the $100 million, we think, will largely cover that, based on Ben's comments around what we're seeing on the current activity levels, Jason. The second question around on cash, obviously, as we began to focus a year ago on this AFFO metric -- and believe it's a great one, because it focuses everybody on a cash -- on a cash side rather than thinking about it just from GAAP revenues and GAAP expenses, the business is comprised largely of these lease -- long-dated lease arrangements, both in terms of revenue and cost. And as we have movements in those, there are effects that happened to that AFFO number, either increases in non-cash revenues or decreases off the revenue line. And the same thing occurs at the expense line. So there's some volatility that was seen in that number over time, based on the timing of payments and the arrangements that we make. Obviously, anything that we do, where a lease has a prepaid component related to it, that would have an impact or a postpaid, if you will, component to it. That would also have an impact to those numbers. And then add to that, in the fourth quarter, we also did the T-Mobile transaction. So all of the -- all of those existing leases, both at the revenue line and expense line, came through. So we have -- as we talked about I think a little bit last quarter, we've historically guided that number a bit conservatively. It's difficult for us to have quite as much precision as we can at the site rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA line, so we've guided that number a bit conservatively. And I think, as I've mentioned in past calls, we would expect, as you look at the delta between non-cash revenues, straight-line revenues and straight-line expenses there, a bit of a drag on the EBITDA, if you will, as we move down to the AFFO and the cash line. We expect that, that gap will completely close by -- within the next 3 to 4 years. So the trend line there should be a movement towards AFFO and EBITDA coming a little closer together. So hopefully, that's helpful on the second question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A quick housekeeping question. First, the $5 million of non-recurring revenue, what's the EBITDA impact on that? And then, Ben, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more clarity. You talked already a lot about small cells and DAS. I think a year ago, on this call, you said you were hopeful that you could grow this business, EBITDA 5x to 6x over the next 5 years. And I'm just wondering if you could sort of update us on where we are on that sort of trajectory and what do you see for 2013? That -- it'd be great to get some more -- just some more clarity on sort of materiality here.","Jay A. Brown","Okay. Simon, on the first question, we did have $5 million of revenues benefit in the fourth quarter, and it was largely offset -- remember, in our outlook for fourth quarter, we did not include the T-Mobile transaction. So we didn't include the costs associated with adding folks for that transaction either. So most of that was offset by the additional cost and staffing cost that we had in the quarter. If you were trying to exclude it, there wasn't necessarily an offset directly related to that, so it would have fallen through. But if you're trying to compare that to the outlook we gave previously, most of it was consumed by cost increases that we have not previously guided to, related to the T-Mobile transaction.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Simon, my enthusiasm around the small-cell business has not abated at all. We've got 9 months of operating with the NextG folks, and we are adding resources, as I mentioned earlier, which is evidence of our commitment and enthusiasm for the business. I still believe you'll see us grow that number 4x to 5x over what we bought over that period of time. We're finding significant opportunities to put capital to work and very attractive all-in returns. And we're seeing a continued migration of capital spending and commitment on the part of carriers to the small-cell technologies and architectures. I would also mention on this call, don't be confused by a lot of the -- what we see out in the press around confusing nomenclature around small cells and DAS and what does it look like in picocells. The real critical element that we offer is the property rights that we have secured and the fiber that connects whatever architecture, whatever electronics the carriers ultimately want to install. And so while they -- it may have initially been a shared DAS system, where you had multiple carriers in each box, if you will, to otherwise going into the small-cell environment of picocells next pullover. The economics to us and the benefits to the carriers of the shared economic proposition of the largest component of cost being the fiber and the rights that we secure, that's all well intact. And so we try not to get distracted, if you will, in the -- with what's going on out there in the marketplace. We're able to accommodate really all of this through what we're doing in the business. And our enthusiasm, frankly, has increased over time and like very much what we see there. And it's certainly confirmed by public statements on the part of most of the major carriers.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investments.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could provide just a little bit more details on the bridge for 2013 revenue growth? So you mentioned that there's -- the $330 million of growth implied in your guidance ranges from 2012, I think you mentioned $270 million from acquisitions and $60 million in leasing activity. But as I put that $60 million of leasing activity over last year's numbers and try to make a couple of adjustments for some of the acquisitions that were included for part of 2012, I'm only coming up with about 3% to 4% revenue growth. Now I was just wondering if you can bridge these numbers to the organic revenue growth to get a cleaner sense of what the cash growth looks like for 2013?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. I think the $60 million is obviously a year-over-year comparison, and there's a couple of things that would affect that. If -- one of the things that I mentioned was what's -- is the contracted escalators on the existing leases net of churn. We expect churn in 2013 to be about 1%, maybe a little less than 1%. So that number is at levels a little bit lower than what we've seen over the last couple of years. We think that will offset the benefit of about 1% of rent escalations that we would see in the number. So the $60 million that you're correctly highlighting, that number would reflect basically all -- that would all be organic growth or new tenants going on the existing systems. And that would be a combination of new tenants on towers, as well as new tenants going on DAS systems. There's another -- if you parse through the numbers and look at -- to Jason's question earlier about what are the movements in the straight-line revenues, there's another about $40 million to $50 million of benefit from cash escalations on existing leases, which is why, when you look at the AFFO growth that we're showing for the year, of about $190 million of AFFO growth, about 80 -- a little over $80 million of that is obviously coming from the interest expense save. And then we've got about $110 million that's coming from the base business. T-Mobile is -- when you add the combination of the financing costs there and the increase in cost, T-Mobile is basically a push. So we're not getting any benefit really at the AFFO line from T-Mobile when you consider the cost increases that Ben referred to. So that $110 million would be what we're getting in the organic leasing business, a combination of cash escalations and leasing, and not really getting any benefit on that cash line from contracted escalations that are variable in nature. So hopefully, that reconciles you -- reconciles it down.","W. Benjamin Moreland","I just listened -- just listening, I want to just make sure that's -- so that $110 million would also be after normal growth and operating expenses x people costs. So normal growth and site maintenance and ground leases and things. So you're basically dropping $110 million through to AFFO. And just to be doubly clear, the T-Mobile accretion, net of financing costs, that $20 million is basically covering the increased run rate of people costs, resources, as I talked about, which is basically paying for the resources we've added through the services business, the DAS business and all the things we enumerated earlier. So that's basically, Mike, I think, the easiest way to sort of cut through it. And then to get back to the $190 million is about the $80 million or so of interest save.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's really helpful. And if I can just ask one other follow-up to that, on the $80 million of interest saves, as you look at all the refinancing activity that you've now completed, is there another leg down of interest cost for 2014 or '15? Or should we look at that $80 million of interest save as really the getting back to, I guess, the run rate of current interest cost in the market today?","Jay A. Brown","Yes. I think on -- there is one other bond out there, the 7.5% -- 7.25%, $500 million -- 7.5%, $500 million notes that we would look to potentially refinance over time. But if you look at the whole balance sheet, $11 billion, the average coupon is at about 4.5%. So at 4.5%, I think we've gotten most of it out at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of James Ratcliffe with Barclays.","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two, if I could. First of all, can you give us a little additional color on, now that you actually own or lease, I guess, the assets, the strategy for lease-up on the T-mobile tower? Are there particular carriers that you think are most likely to be picked up there, et cetera? And secondly, can you talk about what sort of lease-up activity you're seeing in areas where there's already LTE? So Verizon activity in, I guess, by now, the bulk of the country and AT&T? Are you starting to see infill? Or is it still most of the activity you're seeing for just POP coverage at this point?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, James, thanks. With T-Mobile -- and thanks, I was hoping we'd get to address this. We've owned it 60 days, and we're still in this transition period, working through loading all the data in the systems and beginning to take applications on our own from carriers. So there'll be a little bit of an integration process that'll last probably another 90 days until we're completely essentially integrated. But we already are having productive conversations and would -- have very high expectations, as we talked about on the last, last quarter's call, for those sites going forward. It's early days. And so we wouldn't put a whole lot of that in the 2013 run rate, if you will, in terms of contribution inside the year. But nonetheless, we're seeing pretty -- we're having very good conversations and have very high expectations for the long-term growth prospects there. And coming off of a very low base of run rate of tenancy, as we've talked about before, it doesn't take a whole lot of additional tenants to make that investment perform exceptionally well. So we're probably more enthusiastic about it 60 days in than even when we started. And that could be a potential source down the road for outperformance, if we see things happening, as we would certainly hope. With respect to sell splitting, James, and infill locations, I would tell you that it's too early to raise guidance based on that. And remember that anything we would see incremental for the year would only have a stub period contribution for '13 that would be more meaningful into '14. So it wouldn't be a huge amount for '13. But I would tell you that when I -- my previous comments about where we can already see 70% of the application volume we expect on the non-pre-sold activity, some of that is clearly coming from that activity. And so we're optimistic we'll see that continue to build throughout '13. And it's sort of a very good next leg of growth for us going forward, particularly given the 22,000 sites Jay mentioned now with the T-Mobile portfolio, the 22,000 sites that we have inside the top 100 markets. We think it's -- we have lots of sites that are going to be very attractive for infill and cell splitting. And we'll just have to see how that develops. But certainly, we think it's headed in the right direction.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions if I could. First, just want to go back to the straight-line stuff a second.  Obviously, a lot of people are confused by straight-line still. Jay, I think, just to make sure I understood you correctly, you feel that while it's a volatile line item, that you guys are being very conservative on your guidance still and how you take people through that. And I think I heard you say 3 to 4 years before that adjustment goes away?","Jay A. Brown","That's right. And trending towards that. So the line should trend towards that.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second question. With the pending T-Mobile PCS acquisition, T-Mobile has made it very clear they want to keep the MetroPCS DAS networks that have been built in New York, Boston, Philly and California. I believe a lot of those were built by NextG, which you guys own. T-Mobile explicitly said they want to add LTE and HSPA Plus to that. Is that in your guidance? Does that help you guys? Or is it something that they just spend CapEx on by their own?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, Rick. I don't want to really get into specifics on what may or may not happen contractually with those upgrades. In many cases, they will take additional slots on those systems, which will be a revenue event for us. And so I'm not sure we would put that fine a point on the revenue guidance. There's certainly an expectation and internal budgeting and forecasting around the small-cell business, and it comes from a lot of different places. And as we've talked about for years, if you forecast -- if you're within 70% accuracy on exactly where it comes from inside a given year, you've done pretty well. But so implicitly, some of that's -- it's sort of in our thinking. But I wouldn't put too fine a point on that.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if it does happen, there could be a little more upside to that as well, just kind of -- if DAS does play out?","Jay A. Brown","There could be. Sure.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the cell splitting, we've heard that the leader in deploying LTE in the United States has put out search rings to look at that cell splitting to create LTE capacity. I think, as you were mentioning, does that kind of imply that if search rings are out, are you seeing them and that it is probably by a midyear-type event that you might see some of that activity show up at the towers?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I think that's a pretty fair assessment, but I don't want to scope that for you yet. And we don't make it a practice to talk about our carriers' business. So let's let them talk about that in detail. But I think, certainly, some of that we're seeing in the pipeline.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Makes sense. I'll ask you something you can answer directly, stock buybacks. What do you think about getting your leverage back down into your target zone? And as you look at the CapEx program and acquisitions and -- where does stock buyback and leverage fit in to kind of your thoughts of running your business?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. Broadly, what I would tell you in terms of capital allocation, we haven't changed the plan. We look at every dollar of capital that we spend, and the goal is to maximize long-term cash flow per share, as we -- and we measure AFFO per share. So we put everything from construction of new small-cell sites to tower sites, to buying back stock or acquisitions. All of them run through that risk-adjusted filter that we put everything through. And we continue to look at opportunities there and feel like we had a good year of putting cash to work, money to work, on acquisitions primarily, that we thought we're better, frankly, than what the opportunity was of us buying back the stock. And so we'll continue to look at opportunities in that same vein and on the go forward. With regards to the deployment of leverage to do those activities, we obviously, over the course of the year, took leverage up about a turn in the quarter to take advantage of some opportunities that we saw. We thought it was shareholder friendly not to issue shares to do the acquisitions that we did. And given the low cost of debt in the market and the term that we could achieve, we thought that was appropriate. I do think, over time, what you'll see us do is come back down as we grow EBITDA and bring the leverage back down to the 4x to 6x target level that we'll operate the business at most of the time, and aiming to get ourselves back in terms of -- back to -- somewhere in the neighborhood of 5x debt to adjusted EBITDA. We may, from time to time, use some portion of our cash flow to pay down debt, but I don't think that will be any meaningful allocation of the cash flow. I think most of the deleveraging is likely to come from just growth in adjusted EBITDA.","W. Benjamin Moreland","I would just add, I think, Jay, you mentioned we are probably at the highest interest coverage -- interest coverage has actually gone up through this refinancing and through the increased debt we took on to do these acquisitions. Interest coverage, as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA, is actually higher than when we started, which is pretty phenomenal. And as we look back about being disciplined over a long period of time around the capital structure, I would observe that we've taken EBITDA in this company from somewhere around $700 million to $1.6 billion run rate and not issued any shares. And we've done that through a lot of investment and a lot of organic growth. But that's how you get to $3.04 a share. And this year, we'll have, as we've talked about, over $1 billion of adjusted funds from operations. So we're quite pleased with that outcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was interested in following up on your DAS business. And can you give us a sense of how much revenue and cash flow contribution are coming from those assets? And, Ben, I think you talked about over 10,000 small-cell nodes, and maybe you could provide a perspective on how that compares with previous periods post the close of the NextG transaction?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, John. Let me say -- first of all, I'm probably -- I don't want to break out -- we're not going to segment report. I mean, we operate it as the same business. We look at it on a return basis, on capital we're putting in. As Jay mentioned, we're making significant capital investments on the build side. And that goes through our normal capital allocation processing. We're very pleased with what we see there. And the growth there, in terms of revenue, is at or above our expectations and deal pipeline. Obviously, we've put additional resources in it, as we've talked about, which cost money in the short run to build out that capacity and enable us to handle that pipeline that's continuing to grow. So that's probably all I would say. It's -- other than to say that, we're continuing to be very pleased with the growth we're seeing, revenue and margins and the opportunities in the marketplace to put real money to work at very attractive returns, which is what we had thought when we came into this. And importantly, it's the same financial model and proposition that we can offer to customers, which is the compelling nature of the shared infrastructure, where it's cheaper for them to go on our sites and operate on our sites, notwithstanding the ease and speed-to-market that it creates just on a pure financial basis, just as it is on the towers. And that relationship is well intact and, I think, will certainly continue. So we are not breaking it out separately, but we own it. It's paying its way, and we certainly expect to see the kind of returns out of it that we initially modeled.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then -- Ben, you gave some very helpful comments on small-cell and DAS and some of the nomenclature confusion and so forth. Is it correct to assume then that the basic architecture that NextG had used, you're open to expanding that to other approaches, as long as your kind of leveraging the core fiber assets?","Jay A. Brown","Absolutely. And we're working on that everyday right now.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So given your fiber assets, I just wondered if there's an element of your DAS business where you will consider providing backhaul, but not operator maintaining nodes themselves? Perhaps the carriers prefer to build them or already built them, but you could leverage fiber in more of a direct backhaul way, as well as operating the small-cell business?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, John. We are doing that in a limited -- in limited geographies today, where -- it's obvious where we could provide dark fiber, where we've got overpass [ph] in cell sites. So we've got that in a limited way today. And I would say it's a significant, meaningful contribution, but it's certainly a way to leverage that embedded plant. And that's something we're going to continue to focus on.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Richard for Phil. I just wanted to ask on the T-Mobile towers. If you were going to kind of change tower heights, how long does that take if -- granted it's still early in the integration process? But is this something that can be done very quickly, in terms of getting through zoning or not? Or once you decide to do it, it's going to take a while and would end up being more of an impact in 2014 or beyond?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. Richard, not really a difference per se in a T-Mobile site going through zoning on changing height as we would on our own sites. I mean, it's a process. It depends on where you are in terms of zoning. But what I would also point out is that over time, as the equipment has gotten smaller and lighter and the desire for tall sites, frankly, has abated, because now we're covering much smaller cell sites, diameters, it's more and more likely that these sites become available and useful to a carrier without necessarily augmenting the height of the tower. And that's something that we've seen change over the last 10 years in the industry. Very often times, the smaller sites, based on their location, and the smaller electronics and the tighter separation that we're able to put the different rad centers on the sites, make it such that these smaller sites actually have more utility than they might have when they were originally built. And we're seeing that on our own portfolio, and we continue to expect to see that on the T-Mobile sites as we move forward.","Richard Yong Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I guess, is it fair to say then that given where things are, that most of the most recent activity over the past few years are probably on smaller sites? And so the bigger sites are taken and it's not...","W. Benjamin Moreland","Well -- and again, a lot of the activity -- the majority of the activity in the industry the last couple of years has been LTE amendment activity on existing installations. So there's not been a lot of new leasing in the marketplace. As we've talked about on this call, we expect that to gradually change over time with infill and capacity cell splits. But the last 2 to 3 years, it's -- the vast majority has been upgrade of existing installs.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I do have a few additional. First, in terms of the EBITDA outlook, you look at the first quarter and you look at the annualized number that you've given, and it seems like EBITDA is not going to grow through much of the year. Now earlier, you highlighted how, given your MLAs, a lot of the potential revenue growth or the cash revenue growth is already captured in your GAAP numbers. So I'm wondering if this is kind of a similar impact on your EBITDA? And then I'll come back with a follow-up.","Jay A. Brown","Yes, Jonathan. It's the same answer as the answer to Mike's question about revenue.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","All right, great. And then could you give us the details in terms of the split between amendments and new cell activity as it applied to the fourth quarter? And for -- that's embedded in the outlook for 2013?","Jay A. Brown","We're currently seeing about 85% of the activity to be amendment-related. Most of that would be LTE-related activity, and 15% would be brand new tenants going on the towers. And we have a similar assumption for 2013.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. And just as a follow-up to that, in terms of the 3G overlays and kind of the time periods that were overlay versus kind of moving into some capacity infills, how -- maybe you can relate that experience as to where we are in the kind of that 4G upgrade cycle?","Jay A. Brown","I guess what I would say is historically, as we've gone through the process, you end up with a period of time -- generally, it's a 2- to 4-year period of time where the carriers go back and touch the sites that they're already on. And during that period of time, where they're doing the initial deployment of whatever the new generation of technology is, we see the leasing results similar to what I was just speaking to, be somewhere in the neighborhood of 75% to 80% of the activity to being amendments. And then as they move towards -- having touched all their existing sites, then we see that transition go back much more towards brand new cell sites and cell splitting. And obviously, there's been a number of carriers who commented on that, as they roll out their plans for the next couple of years and talk about the need that they have to go back in infill sites, cell split, add additional sites where the activity has been over the last couple of years, more in the amendment time frame. So I think we would say, probably, balance of '13, looks like that will continue to be a heavily amendment-tied activity base. And then as we transition into '14, probably early '14, mid-'14, we start to move back towards a more normal cycle.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, your commentary about churn. How do you think that will trend throughout the year? Do you expect any ramp from the iDEN churn in the second half? Or is that more a 2014 event? And is there any level of discussions with Sprint right now, maybe to lock that churn with increased activity from Sprint? That's something that you could do this year? Also, another question on maintenance CapEx. I think you lowered your outlook for this year, and you have more towers, including T-Mobile [ph] in your base. Can you talk about what drove that reduction?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On the first question with iDEN, we don't expect to see any churn from iDEN in the calendar year 2013. We would expect to see that in 2014 and 2015, in terms of impacting the revenues. We believe that we'll be somewhere in the neighborhood of about 3% of revenues. And for assumption purposes, I would expect we'll see somewhere in the neighborhood of 2\/3 to 3\/4 of that in calendar year 2014, and then the balance of it in 2015. At least, if I was trying to predict it at this early stage, that's the best I could do. But I don't -- contractually, they don't have the right to do any of that in 2013. On the maintenance CapEx side, some of the change there that we gave in the outlook was us pulling forward into the fourth quarter some of the IT upgrade that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So we actually got that done in the fourth quarter, along with some of the tower maintenance activities. We were able to pull that forward into the fourth quarter. And so it's really just moving those expenses between the 2 periods and bringing some of that -- we brought some of that activity and work. We were able to get it done a little earlier than what we had previously expected.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike McCormack with Newman Securities (sic) [Nomura Securities].","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just looking at the maintenance CapEx run rate, it looks like it's a pretty similar level, if we look at '12 versus the guide on '13. Just trying to get a sense, with a much larger tower portfolio, what the piece parts are there? Then secondly, thinking about M&A opportunities, it would seem that domestically, there's not much left. Do you guys have any thoughts about revisiting some of the international opportunities?","Jay A. Brown","On the first question, with regards to maintenance, we spent -- in 2012, we had the IT refresh that I mentioned, an upgrade, which was out of normal experience in terms of the amount we would spend on a normalized basis to maintain the towers. And then the amounts that we would see in '13, obviously that has the impact of T-Mobile coming in. So when you're comparing year-to-year, I think the cover that we had in '12 was the increase related to IT. And so it doesn't look like it's a large step as it would otherwise. Typically, maintenance CapEx per tower is relatively low. I mean, we spend between $500 and $700 per tower per year on maintenance CapEx. And so there's not really a big uplift related from -- directly from towers. But in the year-over-year comparison, it would just be the elevated amount we're spending in '12.","W. Benjamin Moreland","And a lot of it runs through the P&L on a current basis, just as we fix things ongoing. Mike, on your second question around M&A, every time we think there's not something else to do, something comes up in this industry. So I would caution you to say there's nothing else to do. I don't know about that. But I would say, that as we have always done, we'll look at anything, and we continue to look at really everything on the market, including international. We have -- we haven't talked about it on this call, but we've had a very nice growth in our Australian business. We are forecasting good growth again in 2013. There's a lot of activity going on in that market. Other international markets, we certainly could look at. Again, we do it on a risk-adjusted basis, against the stock price, and decide, \"Where do we find the best opportunity to drive AFFO per share long term?\" And thus far, you've seen us take advantage of the opportunities we've seen as we have. But I wouldn't predict the future. I'd say let's -- we'll continue to do it that way and see what happens. And I would never say that there's nothing else on the market. You just never know in this business.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Ben, when you think about the tower portfolios of both AT&T and Verizon, has there been any change in their posture? On their interest in maintaining versus selling?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Not that I'm aware of. Obviously, you'd have to visit with them.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","If you look at CapEx minus land purchases over site revenue, the figure has grown from 7% in Q1 to 19% in Q4. While some of that is for new DAS nodes, revenue-enhancing CapEx on existing sites looks like it's gone up from about $26 million in Q1 to over $51 million in Q4. Can you give us the breakdown of that existing site CapEx between the IT upgrade, core CCI sites, T-Mo sites and DAS sites? On the DAS portion, is there any element of maintenance CapEx on the fiber nodes in there? And can you clarify for us how you account for carrier reimbursements for DAS CapEx? Is this booked as site revenue?","Jay A. Brown","Okay. In terms of the granularity on CapEx, we spend about $10 million related to the -- $8 million related to IT. So that clears off that component of it for you. Most of the CapEx, as we've seen the rise over the course of the year and over the last couple of years, most of that would be related to an increase in activity that we're seeing. Obviously, all of the -- that's driving the services business. So on the services side, we're seeing services revenue as we install tenants and add largely, as I mentioned in my prior comments, a significant portion of that related to the LTE upgrade. So we're adding equipment. We get the services revenue associated with that. And then there is, in some cases, a component of that where we're adding additional CapEx to our sites. I mean, given the scale of our DAS business relative to the tower business, the vast majority of CapEx on existing sites is related to towers and not related to the small-cell business. On the construction of new sites, revenue-generating on new sites, almost all of that is small cells. And then with regards to your last question as to the extent that we get carrier contributions related to CapEx, whether that's on the tower side or on the DAS side, the way we would account for that is that, that would be -- a portion of that would be rent revenues that we would recognize over the term of the contracted contract, the contracted lease. And then obviously, we would receive cash in the current period associated with that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions for you. With regard to the T-Mobile towers, I think, if I have my math right, your guidance implied, on the revenue, based on the EBITDA margins -- it looks like the EBITDA incremental margins were around 37%, 38%. I was wondering if you could walk us through your thoughts of kind of where this might move going forward? Kind of how long it would take? What are some of the steps you'll be looking at? And then as far as anything you're looking at internationally, can you talk us through how you think about return on invested capital in any particular market other than the U.S.?","Jay A. Brown","On the first question, Michael, you're right. We did bring those assets over to about a 37% margin, direct margin off of the revenues. That's a function of having about 1.6 tenants on them today. And the growth in those margins, as you know, is largely a function of what leasing looks like. The incremental margins on adding an additional tenant to these sites is very high. So we've taken -- when we first acquired the portfolio of assets that we had prior to T-Mobile, in the early days, back in 1999, we acquired those assets with about 1.3 tenants on them. And the margins were in the low -- the high 20s, low 30%, depending on which portfolio they were. Today, those direct margins on those assets is in the 80% range, and that's largely a function of adding, in many cases, 2.5 or more tenants to the tower. So really, it's a function of how do we add tenants over time. As we talked about when we did the T-Mobile transaction, we assumed a little less than a tenant add, thought that the assets could hold a full tenant addition to them, given the current capacity of the assets. And without necessarily getting the margins on those sites all the way to the same level as our legacy portfolio, the returns are incredibly, incredibly high with just adding 0.5 to 1 tenant on those assets. So time will tell, and it'll largely be a function of leasing.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Mike, on your second question, in terms of how we think about risk-adjusted sort of hurdle rates and things, the way we do it internally is we constantly are updating our thoughts and variables around our internal cash flow-generating capacity of the business we own. And we translate that into a cash flow per share number, the AFFO number you see on the sheet. We didn't look at the long-term growth rate of that and how we can grow that from the base business that we own in any given time. And we look at the slope of that line. And as we're looking at domestic acquisitions that would have a similar risk profile, similar credit, we see -- it's as simple as, is it accretive or not to that slope of that line, which would otherwise include just buying back stock as sort of the default candidate for how you would spend the money. And if we see an opportunity to add accretion to that number, as we have been very aggressive in this last 12 months, with $4 billion of acquisitions, then we'll move on that. As we look at international markets, one of the things we look at and we add to that mix, is what is the inherent cost of debt in that market? What is sort of the risk-free rate in those markets? Because at its essence, we're essentially a lender to wireless carriers. We're lending them steel as opposed to dollars or -- and so when we think about it that way, it definitely puts a risk premium or a higher hurdle rate, depending on the country. And thus far, notwithstanding some growth in those markets, thus far, we haven't seen something that we're willing to pull the trigger on and win an auction over, given some of the other opportunities we've seen in the space. That's not to say that there are not some good opportunities out there, and we may do something in the future. But that's been our judgment, as we've talked about on this call, where we see the growth opportunity on a risk-adjusted basis in the U.S. and the Australian market.","Operator","And our final question is from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Jay, just on the AFFO redeployment. It sounds like you're happy with debt levels. You've done a major acquisition here, you've accelerated some land repurchases. Not to put words in your mouth, but it seems like stock buybacks are really the best option at this point, unless -- and can you handle another acquisition, if you could? And then maybe, secondly, Ben, do you think -- have the carriers caught up with customer demand at this point? It seems like they've been under-engineering the networks for the last 2, 3 years. But do you think they've been surprised with LTE uptake and usage? Just some thoughts on the overall network.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure.","Jay A. Brown","Sure. Tim, I think, on your first question, as Ben mentioned, every time that we think the environment has settled and we have great clarity on what it's going to look like for the coming months or quarters, something else will come up in terms of an asset or otherwise. And so we have historically looked at our capital and the investment of that capital based on what we think maximizes long-term cash flow per share. And so I would give you the same answer. And as we look at it, we would love to find more opportunities to invest in land purchases and acquiring ground lease assets. We'd love -- based on the returns that we're seeing in the small-cell business, we'd love to allocate more capital towards that endeavor. Happy to buy back shares if we can't find another alternative, or potentially acquire assets. So we'll just have to see what's in front of us. And we'll make the -- what we believe to be the best decision, based on maximizing long-term cash flow per share when the opportunities are in front of us.","W. Benjamin Moreland","The -- in terms of the networks, Tim, for the -- what we see in the market, I'm an interested wireless consumer like all of us on this phone call. And I look at things at CES and I look at press releases and things, and I don't think the market nearly has caught up with customer demand or carrier -- or consumer demand. I think that's a very difficult goal, because I think the market continues to develop new devices and new applications and new ways to use wireless spectrum. So I think there's going to be a long road here on devices and capabilities and services that we probably can't even imagine, particularly when you look at some of the machine-to-machine and automotive and other ways to offload what you normally would think of as a desktop Internet experience that -- now it's very clear. In a mobile environment, we all use it considerably more than in a wired environment. So we've been at this about 14 years, most of us on this call, and we've always thought we're going to get to some plateau. And I think none of us could have appreciated at the time the real technology shift that's happening in all of our lives around wireless. And we're very pleased to be positioned where we are, to have a shared financial model in terms of the shared elements of the infrastructure that is compelling for the carriers to operate on our sites. We're very pleased with the position that we've created in terms of the largest and the concentration in these top 100 markets, as we've talked about. 2012, I think, will prove out to be a real watershed year for Crown Castle. We took some very deliberate actions to enhance our profile, if you will, in the U.S. And I think, long term, that's going to pay tremendous benefits. And I would just point out, as we conclude here today, we did 18% AFFO per share growth last year in the midst of an enormous amount of activity around integrating the NextG organization and our friends that joined us there. In fact, if you would just -- for the negative interest carry we took on for the T-Mobile sites, we actually hit by 20% bogey for the full year 2012. And then we've shown up here in January, with guidance for you that's 21% on a forward basis. So we are feeling really good about our business and the prospects, and we've got a lot of work to do. We've got a lot of people working hard on integration, at the same time, dealing with an unprecedented level of activity in the business. So a lot going on here, but we're very pleased to have you join us on the call, everybody. And we'll talk to you on the first quarter call. So thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude our conference for today. We'd like to thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Son Nguyen. Please go ahead, sir.","Son Nguyen - Crown Castle International Corp.","Thank you, Ebony, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our first quarter 2017 results. With me on the call this morning are Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. And actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors section of the company's SEC filings. Our statements are made as today, April 25, 2017 and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","In addition, today's call includes discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the Supplemental Information Package in the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Thanks, Son, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning on the call. As you saw from our earnings release yesterday, we kicked off 2017 with a great first quarter as we exceeded the high end of our guidance across the board and, again, raised our full year outlook for 2017.","Similar to past quarters, this quarter's strong performance is attributable for our continued focus on execution and disciplined capital allocation. This morning, I'd like to highlight several positive data points supporting our strategy of increasing our long-term dividend per share by leasing our towers and fiber and allocating our capital to assets with expected high returns.","With scale and capabilities across both towers and small cells, we believe we are well placed to serve our customers by providing them with access to infrastructure they need to deploy and upgrade their network to meet the growing demand for wireless services. On the tower front, over the last several years, we have seen a fairly consistent and healthy leasing environment across our portfolio of 40,000 towers. Exiting the first quarter, we are seeing early signs of increasing activity as the pace of new leases and amendments of existing leases on our towers is above the level at this same time last year.","Recent developments like the award of the FirstNet contract and the completion of the 600 megahertz spectrum auction, give us confidence that there continues to be an extended runway of growth for towers. As towers remain the first option in network deployment, providing the most cost-efficient way to increase both coverage and capacity.","Turning to small cells, we are seeing a significant increase in activity from our carrier customers as they utilize small cells to augment and further densify their macro networks and deploy spectrum closer to their customers. Our small cell pipeline currently stands at record levels with contracts to deliver nearly 25,000 nodes over the next 18 months to 24 months, which, when completed, will nearly double our existing small cell nodes on-air.","Our contracted pipeline is a testament to our customers' confidence in our ability to assist in the deployment of their wireless networks and speaks volumes about the quality of our metro fiber footprint and our industry-leading real estate, network engineering and node construction capabilities. To execute on this growing pipeline and to position us for the next leg of growth in small cells, we are making additional investments to further scale our organization to be in position to deliver approximately 10,000 small cell nodes per year.","In addition to investing in capabilities over the past two years, we have made several acquisitions in support of our small cell strategy based on our view that there are substantial small cell opportunities in the top metro markets in the U. S. These acquisitions include Sunesys, with its impressive footprint in Philadelphia and Southern California; FiberNet which includes an extensive network in Miami and Houston; and our recent announcement of our proposed acquisition of Wilcon which has a similarly extensive footprint in Southern California.","What really excites us about Wilcon is that it will give us additional fiber assets in our most active and fastest-growing market for small cells, with Southern California representing nearly a quarter of our current pipeline. As you can see on slide 4, Wilcon's footprint complements our existing assets in L.A. and provides us with opportunities to leverage that footprint in the near-term to execute for our customers and save both us and our customers time and money.","Taking a step back, the Wilcon assets represent a microcosm of our larger fiber footprint. Our attractive dense metro fiber footprint of over 29,000 route miles pro forma for the Wilcon acquisition is located in the top U.S. markets where we believe there will be sustained and significant small cell demand. This footprint also generally consists of recently built assets with only a fraction of our current fiber assets currently supporting small cells and even then at no densities that we believe will prove to be low, as our customers rely more and more on small cells to expand the networks.","As a result, and similar to the early days of towers, we are seeing significant opportunities to drive meaningful return on our fiber assets as we co-locate additional small cell tenants. With what we have seen thus far in our small cell business and the opportunities we anticipate coming towards us as evidenced by our pipeline, we believe small cells is a business that can rival towers in terms of both size and returns over time.","We are also very encouraged that the unit economics that originally excited us about small cells have held as the opportunity had significantly expanded. We are in a unique position where we believe we can deliver sustained growth on our existing assets, and because of the significant wireless carrier network investments needed to support growing demand, still have meaningful opportunities to deploy capital and invest in our business to extend and enhance our growth trajectory. As we make these investments and execute on our strategy, we remain focused on creating value for our shareholders and driving long-term growth and dividend per share.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we got off to a great start in 2017 with another quarter of results that exceeded the high end of our prior guidance for site rental revenues, site rental gross margins, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Driven by the strong results from the first quarter and healthy leasing activity across both towers and small cells, we are increasing our full year 2017 outlook at the midpoint for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. I'll get back to our updated guidance a little later on the call.","Turning to first quarter 2017 results, as shown on slide 5, site rental revenues grew approximately 7% or $58 million as compared to the same period in 2016, inclusive of approximately 4% growth derived from organic contribution of site rental revenues. The $34 million or 4% growth from organic contribution to site rental revenues consist of approximately 8% growth from new leasing activity and contracted tenant escalations net of approximately 4% from tenant non-renewals.","Moving on to investment activities for the quarter, we closed on our $1.5 billion acquisition of FiberNet and invested an additional $262 million in capital expenditures, including $225 million of revenue generating capital expenditures across towers and small cells that we believe will generate compelling returns and deliver long-term growth in dividends per share.","Also, as Jay mentioned, last week, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Wilcon for $600 million. We expect the acquisition to close in the third quarter of 2017 and intend to finance the transaction in a manner consistent with maintaining our current investment grade credit metrics.","Additionally, we returned significant capital to our shareholders during the first quarter with our quarterly common stock dividend totaling $348 million or $0.95 per share, representing growth of 7% on a per-share basis as compared to the same period a year ago. We continue to believe that providing a portion of shareholder return in the form of a dividend aligns well with our business which is characterized by high-quality, long-term recurring cash flows.","Moving on to financing activities during the quarter, we took additional steps to proactively manage the balance sheet by extending our debt maturity profile and increasing our financial flexibility all while maintaining our weighted average borrowing costs.","Specifically, we raised $500 million of additional term loans with proceeds to be used to repay outstanding borrowings under the revolver. We extended the maturity of our credit facilities by one year with maturities now in 2022 and we accessed the investment green bond market, raising $500 million in 10-year notes with a 4% coupon. We also used these proceeds to prepay outstanding borrowings under the revolver.","Following these financing activities, the balance sheet remains in great shape, with no meaningful maturities prior to 2020, a weighted average maturity of approximately six years, a 4% average borrowing rate and approximately $2.2 billion of undrawn availability under the revolver. Our focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet positions us well to continue to invest in our business while providing the flexibility to pursue attractive acquisitions.","Turning now to slide 6, we are increasing our full year 2017 outlook at the midpoint for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by $5 million, $14 million and $4 million, respectively. The improved outlook for 2017 reflects an increase in tower leasing activity from $90 million at the midpoint of our prior guidance to $95 million currently, an increase in expected network services gross margin, as we are seeing a return to the level of market share we experienced in 2016, and our expectations for continued healthy leasing activity across our portfolio of towers and small cells. This is partially offset by higher anticipated costs associated with investments we are making to capitalize on the increasing small cell activity Jay discussed earlier.","Compared to our previous outlook, our updated guidance for full year 2017 reflects increases to expenses of approximately $10 million and to sustaining capital expenditures of approximately $5 million. Given the long cycle time required to bring nodes on-air, the anticipated revenue benefits associated with our record small cell pipeline are expected to come in the second half of 2018 and beyond.","Importantly, we believe we will generate yields of approximately 10% on the build-out of this pipeline. This 10% is a blend of approximately 70% anchor build that expand our footprint and generate yields of 6% to 7% and 30% co-location opportunities that generate yields in the high-teens by leveraging our existing fiber infrastructure. We're excited by this increase in our small cell business and the yields that we're achieving in the near term, and we believe these investments will position us to generate attractive incremental cash flows and returns in the future.","Continuing on, our current full year outlook does not include the expected contribution from Wilcon of approximately $40 million in gross margin and $10 million in G&A in the first 12 months of ownership. Nor does it include the impact from the expected financing of the acquisition.","To wrap up, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunity that lies ahead for Crown Castle. We have positioned the company to capitalize on the long-term growth trends and mobile data consumption with our leading portfolio of critical wireless infrastructure assets. That includes 40,000 towers and more than 29,000 miles of fiber supporting small cells pro forma for the pending Wilcon acquisition.","We believe the combination of our portfolio of assets and our proven expertise in delivering for our carrier customers at scale creates a compelling opportunity for Crown Castle to continue to provide value to our customers while generating long-term total returns for our shareholders from a combination of steady growth and attractive dividends.","With that, Ebony, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our first question from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking the question. In the past, you've given us some good color talking about how the early lease-up you're seeing on small cells is actually kind of in line what you saw in towers back when towers was an emerging model.","The other side of the equation that investors like to focus on a lot is the cost associated with scaling small cells. And obviously, you're folding some additional cost into your outlook right now to support that growth. Is there any story you can tell about how the investment levels you're making in the small cell business may be similar or different to what you were doing, I guess, a while ago as you are building up your tower footprint?","I guess what we're trying to think about the pace at which you're going to see more operating leverage emerge in small cells and to what extent it may correlate with what we historically saw in the tower space?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yeah, Brett, happy to do that. I think the important point to note here is that the all-in returns of small cells are higher than what we originally saw when we were investing in towers and building towers, and that would be all-inclusive in both the operating cost and capital costs.","So that's a component of it. The second component of it is that, from a co-location standpoint, we're seeing the lease-up on these assets occur faster than what we originally saw when we built towers back in the late 1990s and then early 2000s as we were developing the tower portfolio. The lease-up is a bit faster and the total returns are a bit higher. And I think as you heard us speak about, the pipeline that we're looking at, there was a significant stair-step increase in the amount of activity that we saw during the first quarter of this year, which is why we're ramping up on the operating side our abilities to scale for that.","So we've talked historically about our level of G&A and staffing was around our ability to deliver somewhere in the neighborhood of 6,000 nodes to 7,000 nodes on an annual basis, and then this stair-step increase that we received over the first quarter means we really need to be developing about 10,000 a year. So we're scaling the business in order to be able to meet the demand that we're seeing.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And just quick follow-up question. I think Dan alluded to this, but it sounds like your anchor tenants are still paying you initial rents that work out to the targeted 6% or 7% yield. Is that correct?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","That's correct. And then the co-location activity continues to be where we expected. So on a blended basis, as we talked about in the pipeline, the 25,000 nodes that we have contracted, the mix there is about 30% co-location and about 70% anchors, and the returns and yields that we've spoken of in the past, those have held as the business has grown.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","You bet.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Jay, you talked about being encouraged by some of the activity you're seeing on the tower leasing so far this year versus 2016. Can you just talk about just the overall environment here since we've seen unlimited pervasive throughout the industry and traffic growth accelerating? Have you seen a material change in behavior? Or is that what you're referencing with the small cells? And how should we think about you getting to MLAs on 600 megahertz on FirstNet? Is that something by next quarter perhaps you'll have agreements for deployment on that? And any impact to 2017 or is that really more 2018? Thank you.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yes. On the first question around tower leasing in the first quarter, as you saw from the numbers, we raised our outlook for tower leasing based on what we saw during the first quarter. Some of that is, frankly, just normal activity and we really haven't gotten to what we believe we'll receive from FirstNet and 600 megahertz. That's not in our outlook.","In all likelihood, based on the timing, I think the impact of that is likely to be a 2018 event rather than a 2017 event. So most of the activities that were or all of the activities that we're referencing in the guide for 2017 will just be related to the activity we've seen thus far. Certainly, historically, the plans that are offered to customers by the wireless carriers that drive increased usage for data results in invest \u2013 in additional capital investment to improve and densify the networks and we're the beneficiaries of that investment. So the trend line of increased usage and an unlimited data plan is a good thing for our business and generally results in additional revenue growth. So maybe we saw a little bit of the early signs of that in the first quarter.","And then to your second question, the opportunity there is more longer term. As to how ultimately we'll structure those agreements, in the past we've taken various approaches to assist the carriers on speed and used. In some cases, as you referenced, we've taken an MLA approach where they've committed to a certain level of activity upfront. In other cases, we've just done it as they touched the assets, then we see the step-up in revenue. And we're open to both approaches. Both have proven over time to be valuable ways to contract with the customers. And based on their desire and willingness to go one way or another, we're open to both approaches.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first one would be, Dan, I think you've mentioned that the bulk of the revenue opportunity for the backlog of small cells, which you said was 25,000 was going to be in the second half of 2018. I guess two questions around that. One would be what's the total revenue backlog if you could put a number around that? And then second kind of what is the activity that happens between now and 2018 that moves the small cell revenue needle, if it's not that backlog?","And then on the second question, if I could, Jay, could you kind of elaborate a little bit as to the level of firmness that you've reached with your negotiations with AT&T on the FirstNet deployment and how you kind of envision that flowing through the income statement? Is that just going through, say, the tower revenue line? Or is it a co-mingling of small cell and tower opportunities or other things? Could you talk about how that negotiation process is coming along? Thanks.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yes. Thanks, Dave. I'll take the first couple and then I'll pass it over to Jay for the last one. You mentioned just trying to size the opportunity in the small cells, we talked about the yields that we think we're going to get being around 10%. We think the capital that's going to be required is around $1.2 billion or so. And so what we're looking at is on a run rate basis, when it's all installed and all on air, which like we said is late 2018, early 2019 is around $120 million, give or take. Those aren't going to be exact but they will be ballpark numbers.","And what's going to move the needle between now and then is, as Jay talked about, this was a stair-step move in the first quarter. So we had a backlog before, but we added a bunch in the first quarter. It's the backlog that we had before that we will execute on that will allow us to grow between now and the end of 2018, but we won't see the bulk of this really big stair-step until the end of 2018, early 2019 given the timing and pace the way that the contracts came in.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","On your second question, I don't want to get into specific negotiations with any of our customers on a call, but the big picture, maybe it's helpful to talk a little bit about the timeline around FirstNet. FirstNet has a responsibility to submit to each of the states by September 30 of this year their plan for build-out and then the states have the opportunity to opt in or opt out of that plan by the end of this year so 12\/31 of 2017. And any of the states that opt out of the FirstNet federal approach have about six months to lay out what their plan is for deployment.","So I think in terms of timing and when we'll have more clarity, my guess is as we get into the first quarter of 2018, we'll probably start to have some clarity as to what states are going to be in the FirstNet approach and which states will opt out and go down the path of doing it by themselves. I think at that point, then we'll start to have some view of where the revenue opportunity is. Obviously, the timelines from the public disclosures as required by this license, it's a significantly \u2013 a significant build-out that happens on a relatively close timeline. Geographic coverage is somewhere in the neighborhood of about 20% over the first 12 months and has to be that 60% geographic coverage after 24 months. So there is a significant build coming, and the form that it takes and one of the impacts to us is going to be, I think, we got to just wait and see over the next few months here. We start to have some clarity around who's going to ultimately build the system.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, Jay.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yes.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Caller, please check your mute function.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I am sorry about that. Can you hear me now?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yes.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","A couple questions, guys. Thanks. Appreciate the color on the small cell backlog. Dan, you mentioned that CapEx might be $1.2 billion. Can you help us understand kind of the timeframe of that that might take to hit the CapEx line? And then a second question, on the $10 million employee cost, you mentioned that that's for installation and production. Any way to capitalize that instead of expensing it, or what are the \u2013 what does that employee base doing, is it sales, is it maintenance, or is truly building? Thanks.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yes, thanks, Ric. So the timing of the capital spend will likely follow just a little earlier than the timing of revenue.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Sure.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","But we can't give you an exact number on that. It will roll out over the next, call it, 18 months or so. But as we talked about, there was a pretty big stair-step in the last quarter so this will be a little bit back-end loaded from that. In terms of the $10 million, that $10 million is the expectation \u2013 the expectation of what is expensed and not capitalized. So we will capitalize a lot of the labor that will go into the projects, and this will be more of the management level that we tend not to be able to capitalize in addition to any time that isn't directly related to projects.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then not anything specific on FirstNet of the broadcast spectrum, but what type of equipment are you hearing being discussed because, obviously, both are low band frequencies, might be big antennas. So we're trying to frame it or size it for people who are trying to figure out does it look like this will be co-location, will it be amendment activity, but what's the early thoughts on what might be involved with the low band FirstNet and broadcast spectrum?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Ric, it's still probably too early to know exactly what that's going to look like. I walked through the FirstNet timeline. Obviously, the 600 megahertz auction has just been completed, so it's really too early to be that specific.","So, historically, if you go back and look what has happened over a long period of time through multiple different spectrum auctions and deployments of networks, the first wave of activity tends to be amendments on existing sites. And as additional spectrum bands are deployed by carriers, we already have existing infrastructure. We see them such a significant portion of their existing network and overlay that and that brings about meaningful amendment activity.","And then the second phase comes back to densification and adding additional sites. We think we'll see that on both the tower and the small cell side as they increase the density of their network and deploy that spectrum. So it's obviously a positive for us, but the ultimate \u2013 what's the value per site for us to get a little further down the road to know what the impact there is going to be.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good to have it happening for you guys and the country. So, let's see it happening. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. So I had a couple of questions. I wonder if you could comment on the growth that you have seen on the legacy T-Mobile assets versus, say, the legacy AT&T assets as well as just the legacy Crown assets. And then my question on fiber relates to Wilcon, again, looking at kind of a Southern California fiber market and the number of players there. Sunesys is obviously quite, quite big, the company that you bought as is Wilcon. And how does the state regulator look at those sorts of topics around fiber footprint when it comes to approving the deal? Thanks.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Do you want to take the first one?","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yeah. On the leasing on the T-Mobile asset, I think what we say about \u2013 across all the portfolio assets, the leasing is generally consistent. And we've seen the leasing to take form and exactly what we would have expected at this point. So it's still adding about one tenant every 10 years on all of those portfolios of assets. We don't see a whole lot of differentiation between them, but they're all performing as well as we would have expected.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","On the second question, the timeline, if we talked about for regulatory approval is we think that will happen sometime during the third quarter of this year. So we would expect to close on Wilcon during the third quarter. As you can see from the map that we provided in both the supplemental when we announced the transaction and as well as the provided slides this morning, you can see the portfolios are really complementary. So there's very little to no overlap of the fiber there in L.A. and we believe that the opportunity there for us is significant as we continue to deploy wireless. And I think we've been really specific over a long period of time as we look at these acquisitions around what makes this fiber attractive to us. There are obviously a number of fiber providers in the L. A. market that had differing business models than our intention and strategy is in that market. And what's interesting to us in both the Sunesys and Wilcon acquisition is the location of that fiber that we believe ultimately will be valuable for the deployment of wireless networks.","As I mentioned in my comments, that most of the fiber is relatively recently built and has a relatively low amount of revenue per fiber mile, and the real opportunity here is to use it in ways and provision it in ways that it hasn't been done thus far and the deployment of small cells on the wireless network side. And so we're pretty excited about the opportunity. We think the regulatory approach is pretty straightforward and think it gets wrapped up sometime during the third quarter.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thank you. It certainly doesn't seem like there's any dearth of opportunity in small cell despite some carriers starting to do more of their own work. Is this a significant broadening of the customer base? And what's the RFP pipeline look like? Does it imply a further acceleration from even what's already been signed? Thanks.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Thanks for the question, Phil. There is two things that I think are highlight for what we're talking about this morning. One of the highlights is the pure scaling of the opportunity here. As we've talked about this, this is a stair-step. It's a double from everything that we've done life to date. So the amount and scale of this opportunity is significantly greater than anything we've seen in the past. And I think it supports our view that, ultimately, small cells have the potential to be as big as towers are. So I think that's important from a scaling standpoint, and it is a reflection of the broadening of the activity across multiple carriers.","The other important point to make this morning which I think is then an area where people, to the extent they've been skeptical about small cells, the skepticism has been around whether or not there are truly co-location opportunities from the deployment of small cells. And as we look at that pipeline today of about 25,000 nodes, as Dan mentioned in his comments, about 30% of those are co-location which means that in the pipeline today, there's as many co-location opportunities on the existing fiber footprint as we're doing in total on an annual basis currently. So the model is proving out both in terms of co-location and expansion of the returns as well as the scaling of the opportunity. And my view is those are two very good signs that we're on the right track from a strategy standpoint. And in terms of does it continue, we believe so. I mean I continue to believe this business has the opportunity be the same size as our existing tower business.","Thus far, with almost entirely all of the activity has been focused on the top 10 markets in the U.S. \u2013 top 10 to top 20 markets in the U.S., that's driving the vast majority of the nodes to date as well as the nodes in the contracted pipeline, then we believe that the opportunity is going to expand well beyond the top 10 markets in the U.S. and so believe there's a lot of opportunity here for growth in both revenues but, more importantly, growth in returns over time as capitals invested in fiber ahead of the deployment of small cells.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So in terms of...","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Sorry just to jump in, Phil. In the meantime, Jay mentioned this earlier and so did I, that the returns that we're seeing on these assets as we put them out are exactly what we've seen over time. So we haven't seen any deterioration even with the significant expansion of the market. So we're seeing anchor build at 6% to 7% still. And the overall of this huge pipeline being at 10% just speaks well to the location of our assets and our capabilities and ability to deliver for our customers because we're getting what we thought we would get out of these assets in the near-term and it positions us for lots of growth in the future.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And in terms of the RFP pipeline, are there more deals that are in the pipeline? Or is this sort of as much as you're comfortable signing for now?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","We've historically only talk about what's contracted. So if you look at what are \u2013 if you would ask the question in terms of what are we chasing, sure, we're chasing lots of opportunities but they're not contracted yet. And happy to give you an update as those become contracted and in our pipeline and we're working on building them. But as big as the total market opportunity is where you can speculate on, we're aiming towards being a significant portion of that total market opportunity. And what we're talking about this morning is what \u2013 of that opportunity we've already contracted and are working on.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","And the reason that we pointed out the costs that were associated with this pipeline is because we think it will continue or we wouldn't have that in kind of a recurring type of thought process in our guidance. So we believe this type of pipeline will continue.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","If I can follow up, Verizon talked recently about deploying something like 1,400 strands of fiber per route. What does your current rollout architecture look like?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Phil, it depends on where we're deploying it and how many nodes we believe will ultimately be there. So we look at what we believe to be the density of nodes across a given mile of fiber and then the size it based on that. We found over time that scaling the fiber and adding additional strands, oftentimes if you look at what's the conduit there with the ability to add additional fiber strands over time and then what's the opportunity and then we size the fiber build based on that.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jay.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","You bet.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. And caller, please check your mute function. And with no response, we will move to our next question, comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much and good morning, folks. I was wondering if we could chat a bit more about sort of your appetite for further fiber, bolstering your fiber footprint. I mean clearly, you folks have been focused on selecting the right type of assets in order to capitalize on this rising small cell opportunity. How do you think about sort of your footprint as it stands today and the potential to expand that footprint going forward?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Amir, we would think about it in a similar way that we've undertaken all of the acquisitions that we've done so far, and I pointed out three of them in my comments which I think are indicative of our approach, where there are specific markets, there are dense fiber footprints in top metro markets in the U.S., and there were places where we had contracted pipeline in nodes and we thought it made sense to go out and find fiber to do that to use for those contracts rather than building the fiber from scratch.","There may be opportunities for that in the future, but it's going to come down to what do we have as opportunity sets in front of us, and we continue to be focused on the wireless aspect of the infrastructure, what the opportunity is there from the wireless carriers for small cell nodes. And then to the extent we need to acquire fiber to do that and to meet that demand, then I think that's on the table of potential solutions.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And one follow-up, if I may. There's been ongoing speculation or concerns that as small cells continue to permeate the market that can diminish the macro site opportunity. Obviously, that's not a new concern.","Recently, there's been reports or discussions that one of the more aggressive carriers on the small cell front has also expanded its densification initiatives on the macro side. Just wondering, given sort of your positioning and the demand that you're seeing on both ends, can we move past that argument at this point? I mean, are you seeing the demand on both fronts balanced going forward in terms of new spectrum deployment and opportunity sets at both the macro and small cell front?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Amir, I guess the great benefit we have given our scale on both towers and small cells is we can truly see how complementary the two approaches in infrastructure are. And you can see from our results over the last couple of years. Tower leasing has continued at the same level as it has been at. At the same time, there's been investment and an increase in activity around small cells. So they are complementary and work together to densify the carriers' networks, and we're not seeing any signs of that changing.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much for the incremental color.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","You bet.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Two, if I may. Starting with churn, when I look at the guidance the guidance update that you provided, you slightly increased your expectations for churn. But then when I looked in your supplemental, you slightly took down your expectations for the acquired network churn, so the lead MetroPCS and Clearwire. So I guess traditional churn, if you will, is anticipated, call it, maybe $5 million.","And I'm just curious what's driving that. There's obviously a lot of discussion in the market. And we've all seen the various letters that the carriers have sent to the tower operators in terms of trying to renegotiate or at least threatening to potentially leave. And I'm just curious if you're seeing any of that?","And then second question, by our account, maybe two-thirds, maybe three-fourths of your current fiber business is not small cell or maybe even not even wireless related. I'm just curious what's the growth rate for that portion of your business or that portion of your fiber business right now? And what's your current thinking and your comfortability with that business in terms of pursuing those opportunities?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Sure. On the first question around churn, we're not seeing \u2013 we don't have a different expectation for churn for calendar year 2017 than what we did previously. The timing of that churn occurred a little earlier than our previous expectation, but we haven't made any changes there for what we expect over the course of the full year.","On the second question around pricing in the market, we've talked about this for a long period of time. We haven't seen any change in the pricing on towers or on small cells. We talked a lot extensively this morning about the economics around small cells and how they've held since the beginning. So the economic trade there for both towers and small cells has stayed the same. We haven't seen any change in the pricing environment. I talked about this, I think, a lot in the last conference call.","When you look at how we propose an economic trade to the wireless operators, the reality is this infrastructure being shared provides them with the lowest cost alternative, and that has been demonstrated over a number of different business cycles over a long period of time that it's far more cost effective for them to share the infrastructure than it is to own it themselves. And I think that's what supports the pricing model is that the lease cost, if you will, on the economic side is very low relative to their cost of capital. And so sharing the infrastructure provides their lowest cost alternative. And so we haven't seen any change in the pricing environment. On the last...","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's great \u2013 go ahead, sir.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Did you want to follow up on that?","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","No, I was going to ask about the growth but it sounds like you're going to go after that right now.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","I was. On the wireless and non-wireless side, we underwrote these assets and they did come with some non-wireless revenues, a portion we've talked about the K-12 business that we have. That business we think will continue to grow. Frankly, we didn't underwrite it in our models. Our underwriting models were based on what we thought we could do from a wireless perspective and the opportunity for small cells.","We do think that the fiber, given where it's located, is going to continue to have the benefit of customers like K-12 and providing broadband Internet access to schools. That revenue tends to be pretty stable and have characteristics that look similar to what we've experienced on the wireless side in terms of length of contract and renewal rates and other things. So that revenue may continue to grow.","Frankly, we continue to spend most of our time and effort focused on the wireless side. From an absolute growth rate perspective, it's basically in line with what we're seeing on the wireless side, maybe a little less than that. But the focus from a strategic standpoint is on the wireless side.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Is that in your guidance, Jay? Are you guys assuming that in the numbers you provided for guidance?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yes, of course. We have to assume what we believe across the whole business for all of the providers of tenant leasing; so that would be in there.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","You bet.","Operator","We will move next to Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just one on small cells. Is the increase in pipeline and doubling of nodes you're talking about, is that able to be met with fiber you own today or do you think it requires more M&A to add to your footprint? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the $1.2 billion in capital you talked about. And then just on the back of that leverage-wise, given how robust the pipeline is on small cells, does that change in any way how you think about leverage targets and comfort levels? Thanks.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","On the first question, Matthew, the $1.2 billion of capital cost that we're talking about, that includes what we need to build from a fiber standpoint. So we've not assumed any acquisitions to the extent that we don't have existing fiber footprint. That's assumed in that $1.2 billion and the returns that Dan talked about is an all-in return of about 10% yield on that invested capital.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","In terms of leverage, I think that we're comfortable with our targets and what we said immediately following the Wilcon acquisition and then now that we want to finance that type of acquisition in a way that would maintain our investment grade credit metrics. And then with respect to just how we think through the investments in the pipeline, we think we can withstand that and hold that with our current investment grade because it is important for us to maintain investment grade ratings. We think we can do so and still fund that type of acquisition with internally generated cash flows and increased debt capacity.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And if I could just follow up, with the pipeline driving a little bit of a pickup in revenue in the second half of 2018, is it fair to expect then maybe your profitability and AFFO per share growth could accelerate as well given that you're embedding the $15 million in OpEx and CapEx today but won't really see the real revenue lift till \u2013 in about, we'll call it, 18 months? I'm just trying to get a sense of how to think about that 6% to 7% target potentially accelerating into 2018.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Matthew, all else is equal in terms of our other assumptions like interest rates and other things. We believe that as that small cell activity that we've been talking about materializes over the next 18 months to 24 months, we would expect our AFFO per share growth rate to exceed our 6% to 7% target. That has been the revenue assumption there, is obviously a key assumption in our growth rate. This kind of scaling of that activity would result in us being above our targeted range.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. You talked about the stair-step move in the small cell backlog during 1Q. I guess how instrumental was the Wilcon fiber in your ability to close and, ultimately, deliver on those commitments? And I guess generally can you just talk about the geographic distribution of the 25k nodes and how heavily concentrated might that be in the Southern California market?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yeah. On your first question, we thought it was the fastest way to deploy the nodes that we had under contract, so it is helpful on that front. But I believe we would've delivered for customers if we would've needed to find a different way to do it, but we thought the most cost effective and highest returning approach was to approach Wilcon and to ultimately win that asset.","So that did factor into our thinking. In terms of where the pipeline is located, about 80% of the 25,000 nodes are in the top 10 markets. And as I mentioned in the comments, about quarter of the total nodes would be in the Southern California market.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And maybe then just to combine kind of the question around lit services outside of wireless and also M&A. As you think about acquiring fiber assets, how much of a role does the existing lit revenue play into what assets you choose to ultimately pursue?","And is there kind of a threshold that you feel comfortable with and taking on some lit business that may not be your core competency?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yeah. I think there are a couple elements that drive this and I \u2013 you obviously heard my comments earlier around our approach and how we underwrite the assets with wireless opportunity that we believe is going to come from small cell nodes. As we evaluated, there are components of it, and I would not assume that all of it is lit because a big portion of the fiber that we actually lease and receive revenue for is dark fiber contracts. We see that in K-12 business as well as some of the enterprise solutions that we do.","So, we have components of both dark and lit. What we're not in the business of doing and providing the higher layer of fiber services. So we think about the business as just being, to the extent that it's a dump pipe that we're leasing, that's good revenue to us and we clearly around here would've called that gravy. So to the extent that we can own fiber and use that fiber as a dump pipe and lease it to other providers and enhance the returns, whether that be for schools or large enterprises, we think it makes sense to take the additional returns, and so we'll pursue that business.","As I mentioned in an answer to your question a few minutes ago, the characteristics for those leases look pretty similar to what we've seen around towers, high renewal rates, steady cash flows, longer lease terms. So we think that makes sense to take that additional yield on the assets. But as we think about what is interesting to us, the only way that it's really interesting to us as an asset class is to the extent that we think there's going to be significant wireless opportunity.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. I'm not sure if you mentioned this specifically, but the $140 million in the first quarter that you described as small cells, can you give us a sense of the composition of what percentage of that is dark versus maybe the percent of lit or SILEC services that you have to take on with some of these acquisitions? And then secondly, how do you view in terms of the valuation $1 of fiber revenue versus $1 of tower revenue. And how do you believe your investors are perceiving that value as well? Thanks.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","So, I'll take the first part of that question. We provide the segment disclosure based on what we think is important. So the $140 million is what we get offset or what what we would do in the small cell segment. And breaking it down further is not something that we're prepared to do at this point. I can point to you that we have announced what the revenue and gross margin have been associated with the acquisitions we've done that have some of the non-wireless revenue on it. And you can go back and look at what that was. And it's not tremendously different as Jay pointed out. It isn't growing significantly enough different to have a huge impact on the overall small cell segment.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Now on your second question, Mike, around the value, obviously, we'll leave it to investors to figure out what they believe the value is. But in my view, as we look at the business, we believe $1 of revenue from small cells is as valuable as $1 of revenue from the tower business. It has all the same characteristics, long-term committed contract, annual escalations, the same components of we don't have the incremental cost as we add additional tenant, high returns, ultimately, as the asset is leased up.","And then in terms of the characteristics around the physical asset themselves, we find the dynamics to be very similar to that of towers. It's obviously still early days and the tower business has been a phenomenal business for a long period of time. So over time, we need to prove out that small cells has the same characteristics and sustains itself in the same way the towers have for the last couple of decades. But in the early days, all of the signs and data points that we see in the business now operating the business at really significant scale, you'd be hard-pressed to find the data point that wouldn't suggest that this business is headed towards a similar outcome to that of towers.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then I just ask one more follow-up. When you look at the totality of your revenue bridge for each of the last, call it five, six quarters, we've seen that revenue escalation percent rate decelerate, and we've seen the churn come up a little bit. You've commented earlier on some of the factors per churn. But is part of the trend on the deceleration escalator and the pickup in churn, is that related to the fiber businesses coming into the portfolio where you're buying businesses that might not escalate as quickly or might be dealing with some churn issues over the non-wireless revenue that you might not find as strategic?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","No. It's related to the ending of the MLA agreements that we had with customers, as we move from the committed amounts of activity on the sites to doing them on more of a pay as they touch the site basis. So the escalator came down. So that's the reason why that's come down. And as we talked about on the last several conference calls, we're now at a point where all of the activity that we see from customers is as they touch the site, there's a revenue impact rather than baking into our higher escalator over a period of time.","So that's the reason for the movement in escalators. Back to my earlier point around pricing, we haven't seen any change in the pricing environment with the operators.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","You bet.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Three quick clarifications, maybe. Are we still seeing three small cells equal kind of one macro tower broadly speaking? And Jay, just following-up on this, I know you keep seeing it, but do the carriers understand your argument on pricing? And there's a lot of volume a year ago, six months ago, but it seems like their arguments on pricing really haven't heard much about in the last few months. Just curious where you think they are in their mindset? And then lastly, can you just maybe talk qualitatively where you are with churn over the next couple of years and maybe possibly what you've learned from churn with PCS and corrected for any kind of future M&A? Thank you.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yeah. On the first question around small cells and equating those to towers, as Dan talked about, the unit economics have not changed as the opportunity has scaled. And so it's important that we tie this back to thinking about yields and returns, because if we're building some of these systems in the central business district, the pricing may look different than once we get out of a central business district, but in terms of dollars per node because we're pricing the systems on a return basis. And I think the best way to speak about it and think about it, Tim, is the way you heard Dan and I talked about that on the call which is we focus on returns. And the unit economics for that first tenant are in the neighborhood of about a 6% to 7% yield for us, and then the second tenant, significantly higher than that as we leverage the existing capital that's been invested there.","So roughly on the unit economics, it's roughly the same but probably better to continue to think about it in terms of the yield or return on assets rather than tying yourself too much to $1 per node because it's depending on where that node is, you may get a different answer.","Around the discussions with the wireless operators, it's completely fair for them to always look to drive down cost in their business, and we believe that's the value proposition that we present to them. So the conversation that we would have with them is similar to the conversation that I've articulated this morning around, we've got to provide real value for the value proposition that we've given the pricing components.","And we believe on the alternative to sharing the infrastructure, the cost would be much greater. So our value proposition is the lowest-cost alternative. And I think our operating results, whether you look at the amount of leasing that we've had consistently over the last several years, we look at things like the escalators, the renewal rate, other things around the business, all of those point to a pricing environment and leasing environment that's very similar to what we've seen historically. And I think that's driven by, at the core of that is the value proposition that we provide to the carriers.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yes. And on the churn, Tim, you can see from our supplemental, we think the acquired network churn is going to be over time and it's going down over time, and we anticipate it to be generally over by 2019. But in terms of the non-acquired, the normal churn, as we would call it, we talked about it earlier, we believe it's in the same range it has been for a long time. There's just the timing impact for 2017.","So we think that the acquired network churn was additional. I think that's what you're looking for a little bit more color on. And what we've seen and you can see there is that it takes a little while for an acquired network to turn into an acquired network churn. And then it takes a little while even for that acquired network churn to happen.","Because I think as the carriers try to compete more and more on quality of network and consistency of network and the coverage, taking down a lot of network isn't what's really in their best interest. It's in their best interest is to deploy more spectrum on our sites. So we're seeing them and they have over time pushed out a bunch of churn over time, but also just it doesn't happen immediately upon the acquisition of the consolidation of the market. So does that address the question you're asking?","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yeah. But Dan, do you think they end up doing a little bit less given the unlimited plans and everything we've seen in terms of roaming?","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yeah. We think that given the significant increase in data demand, they will do less churn, yes. And we said more positively, we think there's going to be a tremendous amount of leasing due to the fact that there's a lot of data demand over the course of the next 5 to 10 years. And so whether you look at that whatever study you want to look at, whether it's 40% or 50% a year, there's a tremendous amount of data demand that we think will drive leasing.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. A quick question on Wilcon. Obviously, the footprint is very complementary to Sunesys. I was wondering if you could talk about the growth profile, and how we should think about that $40 million gross margin contribution going forward. And then also is that embedded in your 2018 and beyond guidance on small cells? Thank you.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yeah. The growth profile there is going to be driven as I talked about, about quarter of the contracted pipeline is in that Southern California market. So those assets from Wilcon, we believe, will benefit greatly from those contracted nodes, and that'll drive the growth rate there. As I mentioned, they're relatively new assets with a relatively low amount of existing revenue. So the growth rates, and we're not going to segment report Wilcon on a go-forward basis, but the growth rates there would be pretty high from a gross margin standpoint as we add those nodes that we were talking about.","To your second question, I don't know that I would get to that level of specificity around exactly how many nodes and what is exactly is going to happen on that fiber. I think it's better for us to stay in terms of big picture the opportunity there, and the returns in the Southern California market are going to look very similar to the overall component of the 25,000 nodes that we mentioned before.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. A couple of follow-ups. First on total CapEx for this year, can you just give us an idea how much we should expect? And what percent of that is going to come from small cells? With the ramp-up in the small cell activity, is there any change to your guidance of the amortization of the prepaid revenues that you expected for 2017?","And lastly on the macro side, T-Mobile has suggested that they're going to deploy some of the 600 MHz spectrum this year in rural markets. Can you talk about how you're positioned to capture some of that growth?","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","Sure. Let me talk about CapEx, it's in the neighborhood of $1 billion for this year, and that has not changed very much or at all since our last discussion on this. And there's not a lot of change in the amortization of prepaid rent other than what we would've included in our guidance to-date, didn't change a whole bunch on that front. So I don't know if there was anything you're asking in specific.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","I guess you were expecting down $25 million for this year. Or does that still hold?","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yes, that is still holding. So it's not down $25 million. It's that the growth is decelerating by $25 million on our prepaid amortization on the towers.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Right.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","So yes, we still anticipate that to be the case. Yeah.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","On your last question around T-Mobile, I would probably encourage you to ask them. I don't want to speak to how they're deploying their network. But leasing that happens or occurs in the back half of this year, obviously, the revenue impact to us is relatively minimal. We would get any benefit to that really as we start to think about 2018 results. At this point, we have pretty good clarity on the leases that we'll turn on over the calendar year of 2017 and the activity that occurs from this point through the back half of the year is less impactful to our 2017 results and more impactful to years beyond 2017.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, maybe just one more on the small cells. As you deploy the 25,000 nodes, by the end of that deployment, what do you think the tenancy per node would be?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Well, Batya, I appreciate the question. I think it's really helpful to just maybe take a step back and talk about the assets that we're leasing on the small cell site and make the comparison to towers. Really the best analogy to towers is rather than thinking about a node at the tower, think about the fiber-as-a-tower, a tower laid on its side. And we think about and talk about and focus on how many nodes can we get over a given mile of fiber and the revenue and margin associated with those nodes.","So in some cases, we'll take a single poll. And inside of the cabinet, we'll put multiple tenants inside of the same cabinet on a given pole, and in some cases, we'll utilize that fiber by using the next pole over or two poles over and add additional tenants there. And as we speak about returns and focus on driving the returns on the business, in the same way that on the tower side we talk about the total number of tenants that we've added across the full vertical height of the tower, we're focused on the horizontal length of the fiber and adding as many tenants across that horizontal link as possible. Whether they go on the same exact pole or on the tower side on the same exact height of the tower is really irrelevant. It's about what's the incremental return in increasing yield on the assets across a given link.","And so on the small cell side, when we talk about the 25,000, about 30% of that activity, we believe, is going to be added to existing fiber runs or co-locations, if you will, and then about 70% will be in locations where we don't have existing fiber footprint, have not built small cells to date. And so we'll be out constructing and building additional fiber in order to accommodate those nodes. Those new constructed nodes become like towers. They become newly constructed towers, upon which we have future lease-up potential.","And that's what's important about the sizing of this opportunity is we're increasing both the co-location activity. As I pointed out, the co-located nodes are as great as our entire activity on an annual basis currently. But on top of that, we're having the opportunity to build significant future opportunities in top 10 markets, and the business has been proving that out over time that as we build them in top 10 markets, top 20 markets, we see co-location that impacts over time that drive the return on those assets. So we're adding immature assets that have future potential and showing that the immature assets that we've built thus far are increasing in returns as we're seeing co-location opportunity.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","You bet.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Gutman with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping you could review what was driving the increase in network services gross profit in the remainder of the year and your updated guidance?","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yeah. Generally, what we see is an increase in our market share and our expected market share over time. Going back to what we had seen in 2016, so when we came into 2017, we didn't think that we're going to get to the same level of market share and that was the reason we had taken from 2016 to 2017 our network services margins down a little bit. But as we look out over the course of what we can see over 2017, we think that that's going to go back up and that's driving the incremental gross margins.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Just first off on churn, I was hoping you could maybe help us dissect it a bit on \u2013 I know the 4% was obviously driven by Metro, Leap, Clearwire or whatever. If you were just looking at the small cell business, which obviously has some kind of other core fiber business, what type of churn rate is there? Is it less than 1%? Is it 2%? Can you just give us some sense of the churn on that side of the business?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Walter, it's way less than 1%.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","All right, okay. Even though the revenue includes some of that kind of enterprise fiber type of revenue, right?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yes.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Got it. And my next question is more philosophical I guess. You mentioned the '90s and the returns on the tower business and as we all know the tower business evolved where everyone ultimately sold their towers right, sale leaseback and that's what made the business great. There's companies out there like Charter, Comcast others that have fiber that might \u2013 may be at some point in the future, look for the same type of transaction if they don't feel like they're getting through their own use of it the same type of return.","So if you suspend your disbelief for a moment, and said like if you were looking at Charter's fiber footprint in that type of transaction, how much less would it be worth given that maybe the strand count relative to Wilcon is probably less? So in some ways, you get some right-of-way and you could put some more fiber along those hung strands or whatever conduit they may have. But on the other hand, there's obviously some CapEx investment. So how would that impact you think the valuation if you had an opportunity to buy fiber and then lease it back to that anchor tenant customer and then, obviously, make that available to your wireless customers?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","It's an interesting question. And I think if you make the analogy back to towers, what made towers so interesting is that we were able to analyze, based on where the network was, what we thought the future opportunities from wireless carriers was going to be. And diligence is required in order to figure out whether or not there's an opportunity for co-location. Obviously, towers that were built were built small and didn't have the opportunity to add additional tenants were not interesting to us as we're looking at acquisitions.","And I think the same thing would hold on the fiber side. Really have to analyze what the wireless opportunity is and then what's the capacity and is there real value in the asset for that upside. And that's the way we would look at it. Our acquisitions to date, we believe, are proving out by the lease-up. They've got to have, they've got to be dense urban, and they've got to have enough fiber strands to really be valuable for co-location of wireless.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","So let's assume that on the negative side, they would require more strands, right. But on the positive side, they would argue that where our fiber is located is much better than what Wilcon or whoever else was out there have because we're just closer to end-user and that's the end game here. Which is more important when you look at the relative value of that fiber footprint versus what we've seen you pay for assets like Wilcon?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","It's not as simple as just sort of A or B trade, right? You've got to really do the diligence and understand what's the component of the asset and then what would be the cost associated with that against the total revenue opportunity and margin opportunity. So it's a matter of what do we think the opportunity is against what's the cost of the asset, just like it would be for anything else that we would look to from an acquisition standpoint.","Now I think broadly, moving out of the more theoretical discussion about this, one of the things that's unique about the fiber that we've looked at and we've talked about this ad nauseam, I think, is that not all fiber is created equal. And so the fiber needs to be structured and built in a way that's valuable for wireless. And so, in some cases, some of these businesses \u2013 you referenced a few and there are others, sometimes the existing fiber footprint in the way that it's built and where it's located, we don't necessarily think is in the right locations for small cell leasing.","So there's also a component to it of what's the use of the fiber and where is it located against the cost and, ultimately, the opportunity from wireless side. But it's not \u2013 there's not an easy or simple answer to that question. It requires diligence and a thoughtful consideration of whatever the asset was.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Understood. Let me just try one different version of that question. I'm sorry for the last question, but the cable guys, or those that are kind of bulls on them, have suggested that the incremental cost to take an existing run, whether it's hung or within conduit, is just very cheap, like that newbuilds suck because, you're going to dig ditches and that's very expensive. But they're claiming that Charter's fiber is worth a ton because they haven it already and that pulling more fiber across those lines is not going to cost a lot of money. Does that sound like an accurate statement to you?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","As we look at the fiber footprint that we have, there are locations where we've come back and used existing conduit to pull additional strands for fiber as we see co-locations and the need for that. So it really depends on the nature of the build. If there's existing conduit and space to pull additional strands through that conduit, yes, that's a relatively cheap proposition. If the conduit is full and it's literally the same as building it from scratch, then no, there's not as much leverage or opportunity from that.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","You bet.","Operator","And our next question will come from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.","Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, just on last week's announcement, one of your customers wants to build a lot of fiber on its own. How does that change your expectations maybe for leasing fiber in certain markets?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","I think it's indicative of the fact that there's going to be a lot of small cells built in the market. So we certainly aren't anticipating or underwriting the idea that we're going to build them all ourselves. The carriers will likely continue to self-perform, Verizon indicated that in their announcement, and we'll see others doing it. But I think it's indicative of the fact that the opportunity that's in front of us in small cells is going to be really large and significant and a component of that will be sold by others.","Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then I guess just as a follow-up, you talked about of a lot of activity in dense urban environments. So you guys are going to be active in small cell deployment that could be going towards more \u2013 just outside of the dense urban and more for maybe fixed wireless solutions?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","We do believe these solutions are going to be used in the top markets outside of the densest urban areas of those markets. I think it was two calls ago, we laid out our Chicago example, where the original system we had built in Chicago was in the central business district, and then had expanded over time. That's a similar thing that we've seen in almost all of the metro markets where the initial builds may be in the central business district and then expanding from there throughout the cities. And once it's built, we see additional co-location in the initial portions that were built in the central business district, and then as it expands out from there, then we see co-location opportunities as we build and increase the reach of the fiber network across the metro market.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","And in addition to that, no one, we think, is going to move from dense urban areas to more suburban. But also outside of the top 10 or 25 markets to all markets, so we're going to have geographic expansion in two ways. And we would anticipate participating in any of those that we think will generate good returns on the investments that we would make.","Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please go ahead.","Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to be clear. The $1.2 billion and 10% yield on that for small cells, how does that factor \u2013 or how do acquisitions factor into that yield? You mentioned Wilcon was sort of part of your build versus buy strategy. That was $600 million. So I'm just trying to make sure I get the numbers right.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Sure. These co-locations and new leases that we're talking about from small cell nodes, they're leveraging, in some cases, existing fiber footprint. $1.2 billion would be the benefit of leveraging existing fiber as well as building additional fiber.","When we talk about the roughly 70% that are new locations, those are locations where we're building additional fiber, and then 30% in most of those cases, we would not be adding additional fiber. We will be utilizing either the acquisition that we had done, any number of acquisitions or fiber that we've already built.","Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US)","Got it. Thanks. And your leverage increased to 5.8 times this quarter, and you've been around 5.5 times for much of the last couple of years. Is this a sign that rating agencies are getting more comfortable with an investment grade credit rating closer to 6 times for you?","Daniel K. Schlanger - Crown Castle International Corp.","Well, I can't really speak to what the rating agency is going to do or think necessarily. But what we've done is I do think that our business model and the security of the cash flows, a long-term recurring nature of the cash flow supports a significant amount of leverage on it.","And we've seen that our debt costs have not been impacted by any of that movement you might talked about. I do think that our target is to be lower than where we are now, so our target's going to be in the \u2013 we're going to get down to five times range over time. And that we will try to manage our balance sheet to maintain the investment grade credit metrics that we talked about. I think that some of that has to do with financing FiberNet and not getting a full benefit from it. So it's not indicative of exactly where we'll be on a run-rate basis. So we think we will be levered over time, but that the business can withstand a fair amount of leverage and still be viewed as a very good credit.","Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US)","Got it. And do you believe you can finance the 25,000 incremental small nodes with existing free cash flow? And if you can't tap debt market because you want to delever, is issuing equity a part of the consideration for you meeting that 25,000 target?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","Yeah. We think we can finance a lot of that internally. But when we look at these investments, what we want to make sure of is that they're going to be investments that clear our overall cost of capital, inclusive of maintaining an adequate amount of equity and adequate amount of debt to have an investment grade rating profile.","So whether we fund them internally through cash flow or we fund them through debt or however we want to do that, we do look at the returns and make sure that they would clear our all-in cost of capital. But to answer your question specifically, we think we can finance most of that with internally generated cash flow or incremental debt capacity we generate from incremental EBITDA.","Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US)","Got it. Thanks so much.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","You bet. Maybe one more question.","Operator","Okay. We'll take our final question from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Sydney Marks - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. This is Sydney Marks calling in for Nick. He was having some technical difficulties before. So thanks for taking the questions. Back to the 70% anchor build and 30% co-location mix for the pipeline that you've discussed, can you talk about how this mix compares historically? And when you talk about co-location, does that mean on the system that currently has small cells? Or does adding a small cell to fiber acquired from, say, Sunesys count as well?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","On your first question around the 70-30, initially, obviously, over the first couple of years, 100% of them would have been brand-new builds. And we've started to see an increase in co-location at those initial systems that we had built and acquired have started to mature and the activity has increased over time. So the percentage of co-location has increased. But to some degree, the percentages will likely because the opportunity has gotten so big.","As I made a point a couple of times on the call, the 30% of co-locations in the neighborhood is in the neighborhood of the total activity of small cell nodes that we're putting on air during calendar year 2017. So if we were to \u2013 said another way, if we were to just stop and say that all we were going to do was co-locate nodes on existing fiber, our activity level actually would not come down. The amount of activity we've got in the pipeline would suggest there's significant co-location opportunity.","So we're expanding the overall size of the business and, at the same time, seeing a really significant increase in the amount of co-locations. On the second question around what will we consider a co-location, we think about the fiber-as-a-tower. So when we can utilize existing fiber, we think of that as a co-location because we're using an existing asset. So there would be a mix of fiber that we constructed ourselves as well as fiber that we've acquired over time in order to calculate what is a 30% co-location rate.","Sydney Marks - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay, great. And if you have time just for a quick follow-up. It looks like the expected CapEx for node on your pipeline seems to be about $50,000 per node. It's quite a bit lower than you've talked about in the past. How much in the delta is driven by the fiber assets that you bought in versus other factors that might be applied?","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","I appreciate you picking up on that. That's exactly the point. As co-locations occur, we can utilize the existing investment in the assets, and that, just like the tower model, once we have the asset in the ground, then as additional tenants come along, the additional investment of CapEx comes down dramatically.","And you can see that across the whole $1.2 billion of investment that we're talking about and 25,000 nodes become where we're utilizing assets that we've already paid for and expanding the returns on those existing assets.","Sydney Marks - MoffettNathanson LLC","Great. Well, thank you so much for the color.","Jay A. Brown - Crown Castle International Corp.","You bet. I appreciate, everyone, joining us this morning. Excited to share the news with you about the first quarter and look forward to talking to you through the rest of the year.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Son Nguyen. Please go ahead.","Son Nguyen","Thank you, Vicki and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our third quarter 2016 results. With me on the call this morning are Jay Brown, Crown Castle\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors sections of the company\u2019s SEC filings.

Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investors section of the company\u2019s website at crowncastle.com.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Brown","Thanks, Son and good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining the call this morning. As you saw from our earnings release yesterday, we delivered another great quarter of financial results that exceeded our expectations, as the leasing environment continues at a healthy pace across both towers and small cells allowing us to once again increase our outlook for full year 2016. We also increased our dividend by 7%, reflecting our expectations of continued growth in 2017 and consistent with our goal of increasing dividend 6% to 7% per year. As we have discussed further on this call, we believe the healthy leasing environment will continue into 2017.","Specifically, our 2017 outlook assumes higher growth of approximately $15 million from small cells and similar growth from towers as compared to 2016. The growth we see in our business is fundamentally driven by the strong growth in demand for mobile data, which we believe will continue given the continued adoption of data intensive applications such as video streaming, the increasing number of devices that are being connected with the growing importance of the Internet of Things, and the potential for new applications to be deployed in the years ahead. That will rely heavily on mobile networks such as fixed wireless broadband, autonomous cars and augmented reality, just to name a few. With this expected growth and demand for mobile data, we believe the wireless carriers will invest steadily in their networks, including leasing our infrastructure in the coming years much like they have historically to serve the growing and unmet demand for wireless connectivity.","As we have seen over the last two decades, our approximately 40,000 towers are the first option in network deployment given their efficiency and cost effectiveness. More recently, the carriers have looked to small cells to add to their capacity in their networks. Therefore, over the last few years, we have begun to invest more significantly in this area of our business. This investment has been based on three fundamental characteristics that we believe makes small cells very similar to that of towers. First, the shared economic model of small cells drives down our carrier\u2019s cost of deployment. Second, our margins and returns increase over time as the carriers lease more tenant nodes across our fiber. And third, the total addressable market is very sizable.","To illustrate these points, I would like to walk you through our experience in Chicago using Slide 4. In 2013, we had approximately 300 tenant nodes on air on approximately 100 miles of fiber or approximately 3 tenant nodes per mile of fiber. Of these 300 nodes, approximately 90% are focused in the downtown area. Fast forward to today, we have approximately 1,100 nodes on air and under construction on 250 miles of fiber, with the tenant nodes density at approximately 5 tenant nodes per mile. This results in a yield on our investment in Chicago of about 10%.","Importantly, more than half of these nodes are situated outside of the central business district, which demonstrates both the expansion beyond the central business district and at the same time, the densification in the central business district that has occurred over that time. The expansion beyond the central business district into the surrounding Chicago suburbs is an example of why we believe the total addressable market for small cells will be so significant. Chicago is representative of what we are seeing throughout major U.S. metro markets, which is why we remain so bullish on the opportunities we see in small cells.","We believe this growth opportunity from small cells, combined with the growth from our towers, uniquely positions us to capitalize on the evolution of wireless networks through the extension of our shared infrastructure model that continues to efficiently and cost effectively serve carrier needs. The strength of our business model, the underlying strong fundamentals driving wireless investments and the uniqueness of our assets gives us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver 6% to 7% growth in dividend per share annually. We believe this expected growth, combined with our current dividend yield of approximately 4%, provides a very attractive total return opportunity.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Dan to go through a few more details around our financial results.","Dan Schlanger","Thanks, Jay and good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we have a lot of good things to discuss on the call today. We exceeded our third quarter guidance range and raised our full year 2016 outlook, reflecting the continuation of the strong operating performance our team has driven throughout the year and the healthy leasing environment we continued to see. At the midpoint, our updated full year 2016 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.73 is up 10% compared to 2015. This growth includes approximately 200 basis points of benefit from acquisitions. We also provided our outlook for full year 2017 results, which at the midpoint caused our AFFO per share of $5.01, up 6% over our updated 2016 outlook. Additionally, we increased our dividend by 7% from an annualized $3.54 per share to an annualized $3.80 per share demonstrating our strong belief in the growth in the cash flows we will be able to generate from our high-quality asset portfolio.","Turning to Slide 5, our third quarter results for site rental revenues, site rental gross margins, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO each exceeded the high end of our previously provided third quarter 2016 outlook, reflecting the continued strength of the overall operating environment. For AFFO, the quarter benefited from $7 million in lower than expected sustaining capital expenditures. To be clear, this benefit was due to timing and we expect that capital will now be spent during the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the timing benefit and lower sustaining capital expenditures, we still would have exceeded the high end of our third quarter outlook for AFFO and AFFO per share.","Moving on to investment activities, during the quarter, we invested approximately $220 million in capital expenditures, consisting of $19 million of sustaining capital expenditures and approximately $200 million for discretionary investment opportunities. Included in the discretionary investments is approximately $17 million of land purchases we completed to further strengthen our control of the ground beneath our towers, which aligns with our central focus of securing long-term high-quality cash flows. The remaining discretionary investments were focused on opportunities that expand our unique portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure assets and position us to capture more future growth opportunities as our carrier customers continue to invest in their wireless networks.","We believe these net investments will generate compelling long-term returns and enhanced our ability to deliver long-term growth and dividends per share. As an example of the compelling returns we generate, I wanted to highlight the investments we have made in our small cell business. To-date, we have invested $2.6 billion on a net basis in small cells. These investments have resulted in that business now generating over $400 million per year of site rental revenues and a recurring yield of 6% to 7%. In broad terms, this yield is comprised of three major investments. First, in 2012, we invested $1 billion from NextG, which provided us with an industry leading platform and significant first mover\u2019s advantage that we see the benefits of on a daily basis. This investment was made at an initial yield of 3%.","Second, in 2015, we invested about $1 billion to purchase Sunesys, which provided us with an attractive dense dark metro fiber footprint in top markets, where significant small cell deployments are occurring. This investment was made under the shield of 6% to 7%. Lastly, we have made $600 million of net investments outside of these two acquisitions, which give us an expanding asset base on which we deploy additional small cells. These investments are generating a yield of low double-digits, demonstrating the higher margins and returns we are driving through co-location. As Jay mentioned, these results reinforce our view that small cells exhibit similar shared economics as towers and provide us with attractive growth opportunities in the future.","Moving on to financing activities, during the quarter, we once again accessed the investment grade bond market to proactively manage our balance sheet, issuing $700 million of unsecured notes to refinance debt maturities coming due in 2017 and borrowings under our credit facilities. With this successful refinancing, our balance sheet remains in great shape, with no significant maturities between now and 2020, ample liquidity under our credit facilities and approximately 80% fixed rate debt. Additionally during the quarter, we returned significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly common stock dividend of $299 million in the aggregate or $0.885 per share.","Turning to our 2017 outlook on Slide 7, focusing on the midpoint and going from left to right, our expectations for growth in site rental revenues of approximately $100 million includes approximately $155 million from organic contribution to site rental revenues, which is comprised of the following. Anticipated new leasing activity is approximately $160 million, which assumes approximately $15 million of higher growth in small cells and a level of growth in towers consistent with the healthy levels we are seeing in 2016. All of this is offset by approximately $25 million less growth from the amortization of deferred credits which we commonly refer to as prepaid rent as compared to the growth we saw in 2016. Importantly, we expect to collect a similar level of prepaid rent in 2017 as we are collecting in 2016.","In addition to new leasing activity, our organic growth is also supported by annual contracted tenant escalators, which we expect will contribute approximately $80 million to $85 million in growth during 2017. Growth from new leasing activity and tenant escalations is expected to be offset by tenant non-renewals of approximately $85 million to arrive at organic growth of approximately $155 million or 5% growth year-over-year. The change in straight line, which is an adjustment for GAAP purposes related to our fixed rate escalators and contributions from acquisitions made during 2016 bridge the remaining amounts will arrive at expected site rental revenue growth of around $100 million.","Turning to Slide 8, I want to spend a minute walking you through the approximately $145 million expected growth in AFFO at the midpoint of our outlook. Picking up where we left of on the prior slide, with organic contribution to site rental revenues, the $155 million of growth is partially offset by a $35 million increase in normal ongoing operating and G&A expenses as well as a $10 million reduction in services gross margin from 2016 to 2017. Additionally, with the conversion of our mandatory preferred stock, AFFO increases by $44 million, representing the amount of annual preferred dividends we paid in 2016 that were no longer obligated to pay in 2017. And finally, 2017 AFFO growth is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $10 million on a net basis of other items including cash interest expense, sustaining capital expenditures and the contribution from acquisitions that have occurred in 2016. The growth of $145 million at the midpoint in AFFO represents an approximately \u2013 an approximate 9% increase of 2016. On a per share basis, AFFO growth is expected to be 6% including about 100 basis point headwind from the preferreds that will convert into approximately 11.6 million additional common shares on November 1 of this year. Based on our expectations for 2017 and our out-performance in 2016 compared to our initial outlook, we have increased our quarterly dividend by 7% per share, further adding to our track record of growing our dividend.","As Jay mentioned, we remain confident in our portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure assets uniquely positions Crown Castle to meet our carrier customers\u2019 needs as they continue to build out and enhance their wireless networks to meet the rapid growth and demand for wireless connectivity. These fundamentals give us confidence in our ability to increase our AFFO and dividends per share by 6% to 7% per year over the coming years, which when combined with our current dividend and yield of approximately 4%, we believe provides a very attractive total return profile.","With that Vicki, I would like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take the first question today from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. Thanks for the color on the small cells in Chicago. If staying on that theme, could you just talk about the latest thoughts on the zoning and the municipalities, there is lot of articles about the opposition of some towns to certain carrier deployments and to the various providers including yourselves, so where is that coming out, what\u2019s Washington doing about it. And then talk a little bit more about Chicago in terms of the lease-up from the carriers, how are you doing in terms of getting additional tenants on, obviously the low density is improving, is that mostly from the initial tenant or are you also getting additional tenants on? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Sure Simon. On the first question, obviously one of the great benefits of our business, both on the towers side and the small cells side is that there are very high barriers to entry in the business. And so we are accustomed to working through the various local municipalities and what the zoning regulation denote new municipalities are. And over time, we have worked with Washington to put in what we believe is some smart federal legislation that creates a path that gets to a timely answer from the local municipalities and communities. And we have continued to see the impact of conversations with local municipalities as we deploy small cells. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to come to an end anytime soon. But I would also tell you that, that really demonstrates some of the capabilities and expertise that we have in the business that we are used to dealing with that and can get our carriers deployed on timeframes that are reasonable. And so it\u2019s not in anyway inhibiting our ability to deploy these networks on a reasonable timeframe and \u2013 but it certainly gives us an opportunity to set ourselves apart from some of the competition in the market. On your second question in Chicago, it\u2019s a combination of both lease-up on the existing fiber as well as continuing to deploy additional fiber as we have expanded our fiber footprint around Chicago. As you can see from that slide in the picture, we have increased the number of nodes per mile on that first 100 miles of fiber that we had in the central business district of Chicago. So a lot of that would be lease-up, if you will, a co-location on that base of fiber. And then at the same time, we built out a number of miles, about 150 miles, beyond that central business district out into the suburbs. And while we were building that initially from one carrier, we have seen additional co-location beyond that sort of initial build. And it\u2019s reflective \u2013 the Chicago market is reflective of really what\u2019s happening across the whole country. We are seeing co-location which we have talked about in the neighborhood of about three quarters of the activity that we are doing is related to expanding the fiber footprint and building new systems for carriers and then about a quarter of our activity, roughly is coming from the co-location of tenants on to existing fiber plant. And the Chicago example shows kind of that same thing as you look at one individual market and how that works.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","We will now go to David Barden with Bank of America.","David Barden","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two numbers questions if I could, just the first one maybe Daniel or Jay, the escalators for the base case guidance for midpoint 17 look I guess on my math to be about 2.6%, which is down actually from the escalators that were part of the equation as we look into \u201816 from \u201915, so if you can kind of talk about why the escalators are moving around like that, that would be helpful. And then the second part was just on the straight line amortization piece of it, I was wondering if you could kind of maybe elaborate a little bit more on kind of as new prepaid rents are getting paid, I think you said it would be flat in \u201817 versus \u201816, how are you amortizing those, so we could kind of model those in. And then second, where are they coming from, is it mostly the prepaid rents for the small cell builds or is it macro or is it some mix, if you could kind of give us some color there would be helpful? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Yes. Thanks David. On the escalators, I think the best way to think about that one is, about 85% of our contracts are fixed rate escalators and 3% and the other 15% are on the CPI range. So the CPI being as low as it is right now, the average is that 2.6% or 2.7% that we are seeing and what we had in our guidance for 2017. On what you call straight line amortization, the second question you asked, I think you are mixing concepts a little bit. What you had asked was really on the prepaid rent, which is different than straight line amortization. So on the prepaid rent amortization, what it is, is as we get reimbursed for capital upfront, we do amortize that over the life of the contract. So as you think about it, we have about 6 years or 7 years remaining on the contract. That\u2019s probably not a bad way to model it going forward is over that amortization line. And where that\u2019s coming from is both towers and small cells, but the reason that it\u2019s reducing and that $25 million is lower growth in 2017 than it has been in 2015 is that as the tower business has the similar level of activity from year-over-year, the growth in prepaid rent that we are collecting is slowing down to be very similar to where it has been year-over-year, which is what we think is happening in 2017. And therefore, the growth in amortization on the towers is slowing down, whereas on small cells as we are building more and more systems, we are still growing the amount of the prepaid rent we are collecting. And therefore, the prepaid amortization based on the activity that we are seeing in small cells.","David Barden","Okay, you are right. I confused straight line amortization and amortization was what I was interested, so thank you for that. And so just to clarify on the escalators again, so if the 85% and 3% are fixed and the 15% is the CPI, how did the CPI change so dramatically from your expectation for this year versus last year?","Jay Brown","Yes, I think, David, if you look at it over time and this is where the supplement, I think is really helpful where we played out in the supplement over many years, what we expect the escalation on those contracts to be, you will recall a number of years ago where we went down the path with some of the carriers and made prepaid rent and that was often in the form of the increased steps in their contracts as they paid for the right to amend the sites rather than doing it one at a time. And so those were embedded in the escalations on those contracts. As you will recall for virtually all of 2016, we have been back on a \u2013 as they did amendments, they would pay for each individual amendment. And so we saw our last step during calendar year 2016. So that accounts for most of the movement downward. But in terms of looking at what it will look like kind of over time, I think the best place to go is look at the supplement as we have modeled on your contractual steps into the future so that you can get your model right.","David Barden","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs is next.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. And I guess I will go back to Chicago. If I look at the slide, it certainly is supportive of the bullish view you had on the addressable market for small cells. But if you could flip it around and you can look at it from someone who is purely interested in the tower space and say it confirms worst fears that small cells might be cannibalizing towers, because it would seem like from that map that some of those new areas would be traditionally tower areas. And so I was hoping you could just give us a little bit more color as to the capacity and coverage problems that these small cell deployments outside the urban core were solving and why was it that towers weren\u2019t being used in those circumstances?","Jay Brown","Sure, Brett. Appreciate the question. Small cells are a means by which the carriers can make the macro sites most efficient and effective in terms of utilizing the spectrum on that particular site. As I mentioned in my comments and we can see this in the Chicago deployment or we could take it to kind of any U.S. major market where we have deployed small cells and show you a similar trend from the carriers, they are using the macro sites, because they are cost effective and efficient. So, if you could solve those challenges with macro sites, they would end up co-locating equipment on another macro site. But most of the time, these small cells are being put in and around and very close to existing macro sites in order to reuse the spectrum and create additional capacity. And what happens when they do that is it frees up the tower to provide a bit of an umbrella, if you can think of it that way, an umbrella of coverage over an area and enables the user to have a more ubiquitous and uniform experience with their mobile device. From a practical standpoint, the way all of this as users often see this is, we will have 4 or 5 bars on our phones and yet we can\u2019t connect and experience a reasonable data session. The reason for that is that you are receiving or seeing the spectrum and signal at your handset device, but there is not enough capacity in the spectrum to provide that.","So by putting a small cell in the general vicinity of where there is an existing macro site, you are offloading some of that capacity without changing the coverage or the necessity of the macro site to deliver the data experience to the consumer. And so they are using small cells, in essence, underneath these macro sites which both improves the consumer experience as well as frees up the macro site to be as efficient and as effective as it was originally designed. If you were to go \u2013 if we were to go into that this example and blow it up to anything greater detail than what we are showing on the slide there, what you would see is macro sites right in the very areas that we are putting in small cells, but we don\u2019t believe based on the conversations we have had with the carriers, their continued desire to both lease towers as we have talked about on this call at the same pace that they are doing throughout 2016 and that continuing into \u201817, we don\u2019t see any slowdown in the activity around towers nor do we see them using small cells as a replacement. It\u2019s really just improving the effectiveness of those macro sites that they have.","Brett Feldman","Did you have towers in that area, just out of curiosity?","Jay Brown","We do.","Brett Feldman","And do you think that they chose to do this instead of using those towers or is the point was the tower you have aren\u2019t solving the problem that we have right here?","Jay Brown","The challenge is that the data usage in the general vicinity of the tower is so significant that the geography that\u2019s intended to be covered by the tower can\u2019t be covered by that macro site alone. So, they go in and offload some of the traffic on to the small cell, which then makes that macro site effective for which it was designed to cover a broader geography.","Brett Feldman","Okay, got it. Thank you for taking the questions.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Operator","We will go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Phil Cusick","Hi, guys. Thanks. Two. One, first on the Chicago example, if I can, can you talk about what the backhaul situation is there, what\u2019s the mix of owned versus leased fiber? And what do you see in the cost trends for that?","Jay Brown","Yes, we own all of the fiber that was showing there in the Chicago market.","Phil Cusick","And that\u2019s all you have constructed. That\u2019s not IRUs or anything like that?","Jay Brown","That\u2019s correct. We have constructed the fiber or in some cases, we have acquired portions of it over time through the acquisitions that Dan referenced in his comments, but we own it all.","Phil Cusick","Understood. And can you talk to us some more about the expansion of small cell revenue expectations in \u201817? We have heard different types of expectations of this business accelerating, the potential of putting more capital into it, how do you think about that and is there potential to put incremental amounts of capital into that each year going forward?","Jay Brown","Phil, as we talk about and look at this business, first of all, let me answer the simple question and then I will talk about kind of our macro view. The simple answer to your question is we are expecting more activity around small cells in 2017 than what we are seeing in 2016 and that\u2019s the driver of the $15 million of additional growth, increased growth in \u201817 as compared to \u201816. That\u2019s the result that we have expanded the asset base. We are seeing co-location and continuing to invest in the areas where we are expanding that fiber footprint. As stepping back from kind of the specifics of the year-over-year change, we have a view that over the next decade, there is going to be a significant expansion of small cells utilized by all of the carriers to improve the data experience that consumers enjoy. And as we look across the business that we have today and the $3 billion of capital that we have invested, we think we have barely scratched the surface on what the opportunity is there. In the near-term, given the amount of time that it takes to build these projects in the neighborhood of 12 to 18 months, we have a lot of visibility around what we think that revenue growth is which we are providing in our 2017 outlook. But beyond that, we think there is potential for additional upside as both we invest and expand these systems and at the same time co-locate additional tenant nodes on the systems that have already been built.","And the other thing I would say about this is this entire strategy really comes back to sort of the core driver of everything that we think around the business. We are investing capital with the goal of increasing our dividend over the long-term. And so the opportunities that we see in small cells and the returns that we are talking about, we are excited about them because of their potential to continue to drive the dividend over the long period of time and potentially even increase the growth rate of that dividend growth over a long period of time. And everything that we are seeing as we talked about the business as a whole and you look at the sequential change or the year-over-year change in small cells, we are seeing growth in incremental margins and we are seeing expansion of the revenue. That certainly tells the story. And as we go all the way down to a single market area, we see that thesis that we have had for several years really playing out as we expected and we are pretty excited about what it could mean for us over the long-term.","Phil Cusick","Understood. Thanks, Jay.","Operator","We will go to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.","Ric Prentiss","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jay Brown","Good morning.","Ric Prentiss","A couple of questions still on the prepaid rent side, can you break out for us a little bit as far as on the prepaid rent received that I think you said \u201817 would be similar to \u201816, how much of that is going to small cell prepayment received versus the towers side?","Jay Brown","Ric, we are not going to give specific guidance to what we see on prepaid rent received. But you can see in our supplement that we break out, it\u2019s the prepaid rent received and the amortization of prepaid rent between small cells and towers. And you can annualize the nine months numbers that are in there. They are about similar right now. We will see some continued growth in small cells and like we are saying, we will see less growth in towers. So the small cells will get a little get bigger than the towers over 2017.","Ric Prentiss","Okay. And then mentioning that you are going to have $25 million less growth in the amortization in \u201817 versus \u201816, how much was the growth in the amortization in \u201816 versus \u201815 in the current midpoint?","Jay Brown","Yes. Again, if you just look at the supplement and take the nine months numbers and annualize them and compare them to \u201815, you get about $50 million of additional growth from prepaid rent amortization \u201816 over \u201815.","Ric Prentiss","Okay. And then some questions about \u2013 like Brett\u2019s question about cannibalization, can you update us a little bit on just, if the carrier wanted to get off of a macro tower, if their contract was up and they wanted to move to a small cell system or move to somebody that was able to get a new tower built nearby, what\u2019s the estimate that you guys have as far as what that switching cost would be, how much would it cost them to actually physically get off the tower, I know it all varies by how much equipment, but is there a good kind of rule of thumb average that people should think about?","Jay Brown","Well, just coming off of the tower is one cause. That would be in the neighborhood of probably $35,000 to $40,000 to take the equipment down. The real issue is the geographic coverage of small cells as compared to a tower. A tower is going to cover anywhere between an 8.5 mile of geography around a given macro site. And a small cell is going to cover a couple of hundred feet. And so if you were trying to replicate the small cells, the coverage of towers, the quantity of those would probably be well in excess of 15, 20, 25, maybe 30-plus small cells in order to get any more close to the capacity of a macro \u2013 a single macro site. And the economics of a small cell are about a third of that tower. So from a cost standpoint, it just doesn\u2019t ever make sense to utilize small cells as a replacement for macro sites, which is why we don\u2019t see that happening. But where they do, do it is, as I mentioned in the comments Ric, earlier to Brett, where they are doing it is in places where it makes that macro site more efficient. So I just don\u2019t \u2013 we are not concerned at all that small cells are going to cannibalize macro sites and the demand for macro sites because of the cost element of that. And if you look at what is the main driver of that cost, it\u2019s the cost to construct and build fiber which makes up the vast majority of the cost of small cell nodes and that cost is not going to come down over time. That\u2019s the construction cost. It\u2019s likely an escalating cost over time rather than a cost that would decline say with the reduction of the cost of technology. So I think the economics, if you look at it on a comparison basis, would suggest macro sites are definitely the preferable approach for the carriers when it will solve the problem.","Ric Prentiss","It makes sense. And one quick one on escalators like David asked, so should we assume that the 85%, 15% split, as we think about taking escalators into the future not just \u201817, but that \u201818 and \u201819 should look like \u201817 if there were no other changes to CPI then?","Jay Brown","Yes. Ric, that\u2019s accurate and you can see that in the supplement. But beyond that, it\u2019s about 85% fixed and a 15% floating is still the real variable that will change over time that\u2019s where the CPI fall out. And it could \u2013 given how low the CPI is currently, I guess it\u2019s unlikely that it cuts against this. More likely, it cuts for us.","Ric Prentiss","Sure, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","We will go to Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Niknam","Hi guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just one on fourth quarter site leasing guidance, so you saw about a $7 million up-tick this quarter in site leasing revenues, the midpoint of the guide next quarter implies about $1.5 million lift sequentially, so maybe if you can explain what\u2019s driving the slowdown. And then second, on the 2017 outlook, just wondering how you get to that 5% core growth next year, specifically around how you build in new activity in non-renewals split up over the course of the year? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Yes. On your first question around sequential growth, it has to do with the timing of leasing and churn. The amount of churn that we have in the fourth quarter is really driving that. As I mentioned, I think we have said it a couple of different ways. In terms of the activity that we see, we are not seeing any slowdown in the activity and we think the level of \u201816 continues into 2017. So it\u2019s really around the timing of churn.","Dan Schlanger","Yes. So on your second question on what we\u2019re building on the 5% growth over 2017, we talked about the push out of churn from \u201816 into \u201817. You can see that in the supplement, where some of the consolidation churn that we expected to happen in \u201816 were now pushed out to \u201817. So what that does is twofold. It increases the \u201815 base and decreases what could happen in \u201817, so that\u2019s baked in. And the second is what Jay talked about as part of the prepared remarks is that we do see $15 million of incremental growth on the small cells. So we talked about historically that being about $55 million of growth in small cell revenues in \u201816 and we\u2019re looking for something in the $70 million neighborhood going into \u201817. And then from macro towers, we see similar growth from \u201816 going into \u201917, so no real slowdown at all and a pickup in the small cells, which when you put all that together gets to the growth that we have shown. It\u2019s just \u2013 unfortunately, it\u2019s offset by this prepaid rent that we talked about a bit on the call today that\u2019s coming down in growth by $25 million. It reduces the growth rate a fair amount. So we see on kind of the core activity for small cells increasing and towers staying the same and the non-cash portion coming down from a growth perspective. And just to expand a bit on that on the prepaid, it\u2019s really related to prior year more than this year because it\u2019s the amortization over a long period of time. And so really as the leveling off occurs, like I mentioned earlier, the tower business that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the lower growth as opposed to anything that\u2019s impacting this year\u2019s activity.","Matthew Niknam","And just a follow-up, in terms of pacing of new activity next year, I know traditionally it\u2019s been a little bit more second half weighted, any change in terms of how we should think about that for \u201817?","Jay Brown","No Matt, no change and what is difficult [indiscernible] we go into the year, we would expect next year to be a bit back end loaded.","Matthew Niknam","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much. I was wondering if we could just revisit the questions earlier around the escalators, I mean it seems like the way we should think about it is it\u2019s really a function that mix relative to the contribution of fixed versus CPI-related contracts, but clearly, there has been a lot of chatter by select carriers trying to express their views on the trajectory of escalators going forward, have you seen any push-backs or discussions and would love just sort of thought process around where those discussions have gone and perhaps why you feel comfortable that the fixed rate that you have in place right now is something that we should consider going forward?","Jay Brown","Yes. Amir, I appreciate the question. I think one of this \u2013 and these questions, obviously come up a number of times over the last few quarters. One of the benefits of the supplement I would say is that you can see clearly and go back over time and see that there hasn\u2019t been any change in that escalator. It\u2019s set right in where we expected it too several years ago. So we have not seen any change in our pricing constructs with our tenants and don\u2019t expect that we are going to see any change in that pricing construct. Ultimately, the conversation around price goes to the very attractive value proposition that we have with the carriers. We are sharing the infrastructure across multiple carriers. And the cost of their leasing of these sites or use of these sites is the cost at sub-3%. So when they look at including the effects of all of the amendments that they have done over time and adding additional equipment on the site and were to upgrade through multiple technologies, we are still providing that infrastructure at a very attractive cost proposition to them. And so when there is conversations around the construct and the lease arrangements between us and the carriers which there have been dating all the way back to 1999 when we first leased these assets, the conversation always went right to, what is the value proposition, what are they receiving in exchange for what the cost otherwise would have been and that value proposition remains intact. And we think it remains very attractive. The last point I will make about this is the underlying cost of this real estate, as Simon referenced earlier around municipalities and zoning and other things has driven the cost of the real estate up faster than the carriers\u2019 cost to share that infrastructure over time. And so the underlying cost of the real estate is very supportive of what we are able to achieve on the escalation side and we see that remaining intact. And we haven\u2019t seen nor do I expect we will see a real change in the pricing construct.","Amir Rozwadowski","That\u2019s very helpful. And if I may one quick follow-up. We are starting to get some data points about potentially some new spectrum deployment starting in \u201817 whether it\u2019s AWS-3 or even FirstNet seemingly getting a lot more traction. What are your thought process around the deployments of those spectrum opportunities and how should we think about those opportunities in relation to your current expectations for growth?","Jay Brown","Yes, we are assuming largely what\u2019s in the market today in terms of our expectation for growth and we are not assuming additional spectrum auctions or additional deployments beyond what\u2019s there. So, those could be potential upsides to our forecast. What I would tell you over time, as we have seen multiple auctions done and spectrum in the hands of the operators, that\u2019s very likely to extend our runway of growth. So, as we talk about our long-term expectation of growth, it supports our view, we believe that we will be able to sustain our 6% to 7% growth over a long period of time.","Amir Rozwadowski","Excellent. Thank you so much for the incremental color.","Operator","And we will go to Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company.","Colby Synesael","Great, thank you. Two questions if I may. The first one I am just curious if you are finding that having both a macro portfolio as well as small cells is helping one another, so having small cells has helped your macro business or having macro in a given area has helped you win small cell deals that were otherwise, I guess, being competitively bid? And then my second question has to do with the cost of small cells, so at CTIA, one of the takeaways I had was that the carriers are pushing that. If we are going to build out hundreds of thousands if not millions of these over a period of time versus today that the typical carrier has, I don\u2019t know, 40,000 or 60,000 or 70,000 macro cell sites out there, the cost has to come down significantly. And there is talk about is $500 a node or $200 a node the right price. And one of the ways I thought about it is that you could actually, as a fiber provider, go in and share that cost, not just across various wireless carriers, but across other industry vertical that might be interested in fiber such as healthcare or cloud companies or financial services or education etcetera. How big of a focus is that for you? And do you see yourself splitting the cost or sharing the cost of fiber and small cells with those other verticals? And does that become an increasing area of focus for you as you go forward? Thanks.","Jay Brown","You bet, Colby. On your first question related to having small cells help the macro tower business, I would start by just affirming if we have done multiple times in the call, the tower business is a phenomenal business. And whether you are in the small cell business or not, we think there is tremendous value that has been created in the tower business obviously. But we also believe there is the tremendous amount of value that\u2019s going to be created in the tower business and we don\u2019t view being in the small cell business as a requirement to be successful, a continued success around the tower business and the growth opportunity there. So, I don\u2019t think you have to be in the small cell business. The opportunity that we have seen in small cells, we are there because we believe that will increase and drive dividend growth over a long period of time. So, we believe that the smart allocation of capital that continues to further the growth model, but don\u2019t view it as a necessity to be in. There is certainly incrementally at senior levels of the carriers. It enables a broader conversation about how to be thinking about network deployment. We think that\u2019s helpful and informative to us as we think about the long-term as we can have a broader conversation. But depending on the returns, there maybe a day when we choose not to invest heavily in small cells. So, it\u2019s really a return driven analysis for us, but would admit there is some incremental value around the conversation with the carriers.","On the second point and your question around the costs needed to come down, again, just like in towers, small cells are a shared infrastructure asset that the economics of which are far more attractive to the carriers as a result of us sharing among multiple parties than they would be if they were self performed or built for only one carrier. So, the costs effectively are coming down by us being a third-party provider and the initial carrier not bearing the full cost of the deployment and on the ongoing operating costs we are going to share that across multiple operators. As we think about the potential growth drivers of revenue and cash flow over time as we think about that as a shareable asset, our primary focus remains on the wireless carriers. And so using this fiber deployment for small cells, we think is the vast majority of the economic driver for both growth and the opportunity that we see. We have as you know from our Sunesys acquisition and in certain geographies we have used our fiber to provide things like K-12, which is providing broadband to school. Those are long-term contracts that have positions that are very similar to towers and that of small cells and that obviously puts fiber in the areas where people are located in where there is a density of population and so we found over time there are some real synergies of revenues around using that fiber for both schools and then ultimately small cells or small cells and then secondarily to schools. So, there may be over time ways for us to continue to select the assets. That\u2019s not our primary driver at this point, but we do look at some specific cases where we see opportunities for us to expand the revenue and the cash burn.","Colby Synesael","Thank you very much.","Operator","Matthew Heinz with Stifel is next.","Matthew Heinz","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could kind of give us a little more detail on the approximate split of new construction in co-location activity that\u2019s contemplated in your small cell guidance for roughly the $70 million of new leasing, I guess just to get a sense of the capital intensity of that growth?","Jay Brown","Sure. About 75%, roughly three quarters of the growth is being driven by the deployment of new systems in areas where we don\u2019t have systems today and that could be \u2013 when I say new areas that could be like the Chicago example where we are expanding beyond the central business district that\u2019s still in the Chicago market. And then about a quarter roughly of the activity is coming from co-location on existing plant.","Matthew Heinz","Okay. And then just to confirm, the new construction activity does go under new leasing, is that correct? I guess\u2026.","Jay Brown","That\u2019s correct.","Matthew Heinz","I guess, it\u2019s a little bit different from maybe how you would account for a new tower.","Jay Brown","That\u2019s correct. On the tower side, that is separated over in the acquisitions and new tower builds. As the Chicago example shows and the reason for doing that, first of all, you are accurate in your description. We have both the new and the co-location in the leasing bucket on the left hand side of the chart there. And then on the tower side, if we build a new tower, that goes over in the tower builds and acquisitions. So, your assumption is accurate. We do that, because we find it very difficult to allocate both capital and revenue and cash flows as we build laterals on existing systems, at what point is the lateral a new system versus a part of the existing system. And so for ease-of-use, we have just combined those. And again three quarters plus of the activity at this point continues to be the deployment of new system.","Matthew Heinz","Okay. And then you mentioned that potential upside to your guidance was possible and you think that if that were to occur, it would most likely be on the co-location side?","Jay Brown","No, Matthew, I would point to the opportunity for us to do it both on the deployment of additional systems as well as co-location. We think those two things will go hand in hand. We are building the early stages of this plant very similar to the early days of towers, where towers were being deployed starting at the central areas of urban areas and then expanding out to the suburbs and that\u2019s happening in small cells. We think that will continue from the markets that we have been in where the vast majority of the activity has been in and around the top 10 markets in the U.S. We see that expanding outside of the top 10 markets. We also see it expanding beyond sort of the central business districts of those markets. So, our expectation today would be that over time we will continue to invest additional capital as the carriers deploy small cells to improve their networks.","Matthew Heinz","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And then if I could just go over to the non-renewals, it looks like the expected churn from acquired networks in \u201817 was down $15 million at the midpoint from your last report. I am just wondering how I should square that up with your comments that churn \u2013 non-renewals have been pushed out from \u201816 into \u201817. And then if I sort of split out the acquired network churn from the normal churn, I get to about $30 million of quote normal churn or 90 basis points which I think is probably below your historical experience, I am just wondering what you are seeing there in the business that\u2019s kind of reducing the go-forward churn expectations on the normalized side?","Dan Schlanger","So thanks, Matthew. To your first point, squaring up the \u201815 to \u201817 move, some churn was pushed out from \u201816 to \u201817, but other churn was pushed from \u201817 to beyond, so you can see the beyond column in our supplement will go up as well to make up for that. So what it looks like is that lower churn than we expected in \u201816. And even though some of that pushed out into \u201817, some got pushed even further out. So that\u2019s how you square those two things, if that makes sense.","Matthew Heinz","Okay.","Dan Schlanger","And then in terms of the normal churn, I think you are right. You back out what we see as consolidation churn and at least around 90 basis points is your math, I would say a little around 1% is what we are seeing right now, yes. And it\u2019s a little less than what we have seen historically and talking bout historically, 1% is what we are seeing now.","Matthew Heinz","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","We will go next to Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Spencer, your line is open and we are unable to hear, if you could please check your mute button. And hearing no response, we will move on to Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Nick Del Deo","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have recognized that it\u2019s only in the process, but can you speak to what you are seeing in terms of amendment revenue from AWS-3 upgrades. And more specifically, are the amendment rates consistent with past amendment cycles or are customers trying to put the antennas they can run both AWS-1, AWS-3 which might gone more modest incremental rates?","Jay Brown","Yes. Nick, on the amendment side, we are seeing pretty similar both rates on the equipment as well as size of equipment, etcetera, from an amendment cycle, so pretty similar to what we have seen over many years. We would expect \u2013 I mean as you referenced, given what\u2019s going on in the market, amendment activity as a component of total leasing activity may increase as a percentage of that in 2017 as the carriers focus on some of the activities that you referenced.","Nick Del Deo","Okay, great. And then maybe a longer-term question, yes, if I look at your \u201817 outlook, if my math is right, it seems you are guiding to something like an incremental cash EBITDA margin on site leasing revenue of about 80% next year, maybe that\u2019s 75% if you strip out the amortization of prepaid rent, is that something we should be thinking of as sort of a normal incremental margin over the next several years given the tower and small cell mix or do you think there is a potential to do better in the small cell 5-point scales?","Jay Brown","I want to separate the two and talk about towers and small cells separately. On the tower side, when you look at the cost structure, both at the direct operating expenses side and at the G&A side, we are holding costs effectively flat. We would expect a normal course just across the wording adjustment to be about 3% increases year-over-year. And we are well inside of that on towers basically holding everything roughly flat year-over-year. So that drives incremental margins that are extremely high, well over 80%. About 90% would be our expectation, if we think about 2017 on the towers side. On the small cells side, we got a combination of two things going on. On those systems where we are co-locating, we are seeing very high incremental returns which expand the margins on the systems where we are seeing co-location. As we put new systems on air, those margins \u2013 the margins of those new systems are in the neighborhood of about 60% for a new system. So those immature assets, if you want to think about them that way. Those immature assets with slightly lower margin than the overall average basically hold the average down. And we don\u2019t see the full benefit of the incremental margins that we are seeing on small cells from a co-location standpoint. And how that progresses over time will largely be a function of how many opportunities do we have in front of us, how much do we invest on the deployment of additional systems and then the margins will fall out from there. If you fast forward all the way to the end of this when the market becomes more saturated in terms of the deployment of those systems, what we see on individual systems is margins that expand at paces that are in line with what we have seen historically for towers. And so rolling forward to a very long view of small cells, I think you continue to see the margins expand and approaching levels that we have enjoyed in the tower business.","Dan Schlanger","And Nick, before we move off of that, just if you look at the $30 million increase in OpEx and G&A year-over-year, that\u2019s less than 3% of our total cost structure. And that\u2019s an increasing activity. So I do think that what Jay talking about is we are seeing some of that operating leverage now.","Nick Del Deo","Okay, that\u2019s fine. Thanks for the color guys.","Operator","We will now go to Michael Rollins with Citi Research.","Michael Rollins","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you can refer to your press release where you do the floating bar charts, where you break down the leasing activity, the escalators, the renewals, etcetera, why not move the impact of prepaid rent amortization from the organic conversation over to the way that you look at straight line and acquisitions and if you were to do that, can you help us think through what that says about what activity might have been in 2016 versus what activity looks like in 2017? Thanks.","Dan Schlanger","Yes. So the reason is because prepaid rent really is an economic decision that our customers and we are making together. And we are getting that rent either upfront or as part of the ongoing operation of the business. So it is really tied on some levels to the new leasing activity. So it is part of the economics we enter into. And if we haven\u2019t gotten the rent upfront, we would be putting it in new leasing activity revenue. But if we don\u2019t put it there or take credit for it from the capital side, it gets lost in that. So we think of it as tied to leasing activity. The reason why it\u2019s growing less isn\u2019t necessarily reflective of the current activity in \u201816 or \u201817, because the current activity in \u201816 we said it\u2019s about flat from \u201815 and it\u2019s about flat to \u201817. That\u2019s why it is actually plateauing and the growth in prepaid rent amortization is coming down. So what it\u2019s speaking to is specifically on the tower side is that growth is the same year-over-year, which is why you are not seeing incremental prepaid amortization, whereas on the small cell side, you are because we are continuing to invest in that business, grow it and get more prepaid rent that we are collecting on that business.","Jay Brown","Of course you could say and maybe just an additional point there which maybe was the second part of your question, given that we have referenced the amortization what\u2019s related to the tower business, basically towers on an apples-to-apples basis is about flat of about $90 million roughly year-over-year. And then on the small cells side, it\u2019s up $15 million, so it\u2019s gone from about $55 million to about $70 million. So if you thought about it and you wanted to exclude kind of the prepaid conversation from that analysis, then the growth is up about 100 basis points, if you were to take it \u2013 if you were saying take a portion of that graph and move it kind of over to the right hand side. And that 100 basis points is being driven entirely from small cells.","Michael Rollins","And then if you look at the $55 million to $70 million for small cells, how much of that is being driven by incremental co-location versus capital spending in deploying new systems?","Jay Brown","I would say it\u2019s about the same split. So I would put about three quarter of that to new systems and about a quarter of that roughly to co-location.","Michael Rollins","Thanks very much.","Operator","We will go to Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi","Great. Thank you. A follow-up on the CapEx side, as you look to invest more on the small cells next year, can you provide maybe a dollar amount in terms of how much construction CapEx do you expect to spend. And more strategically, as you are looking to invest more in small cells, can you talk about your decision making process in terms of building versus acquiring from \u2013 more fiber assets and maybe leveraging some \u2013 your weak multiple into looking \u2013 to acquire some assets that are not getting the REIT multiples? Thank you.","Dan Schlanger","Let me take the first one and [indiscernible] to Jay on the second one, which is on the capital side, on construction, its similar year-over-year from \u201816 to \u201817 on the small cells side. So you should expect to see generally the same amount of spending.","Jay Brown","Batya, on your second question, we will look at and we will continue to look at opportunities to acquire fiber assets. But the driver of that as I mentioned earlier around our strategy is to lease that fiber to wireless operators primarily for the use of small cells. And so to the extent that we can identify fiber in a given market that we think makes sense on that basis, then we would be interested in the asset, but we don\u2019t spend a lot of time around here thinking about arbitrage within multiples and things. Businesses are valued where they are valued. And so our approach is to invest capital in ways that drive the dividend over the long-term and our strategy for doing that is focused on the wireless operators and deploying small cells.","Batya Levi","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next is Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Walter Piecyk","Thanks. Just a quick question on the co-location, can you define what that means is that just putting another radio in the box that\u2019s already in the lamppost or does that also include connecting a lamppost that happens to be right above your fiber?","Jay Brown","It would be both of those, Walter.","Walter Piecyk","Got it. And then very interesting chart, Chicago, thanks, the five you said gets you to 10% returns. So, just two questions on that, in 5 years, how many tenants per mile do you expect to get? You can obviously give a range and best case scenario or worst case whatever assuming that we get to like in an industry of 1 million plus small cells that type of backdrop. And then if you can just give us some sense \u2013 I know this is not easy, but assuming this 75%, 25% mix that I think you have referenced now 3x on the call, how the returns would increase as that 5 tenants per mile goes up? Is it like 200 basis points per tenant or any way you can scale that for us as far as the implied returns of adding additional tenants per mile? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Yes, I think in Chicago, I will put on how many tenants per node per mile of fiber we are going to ultimately get to. These systems and just to take you back to kind of how we would think about underwriting Chicago and how we did think about underwriting Chicago, we would look at return based on the cost of deployment of the fiber. So, obviously, in the central business district, as you would expect, the cost of deploying that fiber would be significantly greater than as we move out to suburbs, generally speaking, in a metro market. And so the number of nodes required to get to an acceptable IRR or yield on that investment is going to differ based on the cost. What I would tell you, generally, Walter, is that the pace of leasing on small cells has been about twice the pace of that of towers that we have seen historically. And the returns to kind of your last question, the returns track that. So, we are 3 years in on this Chicago system roughly from 2013 to 2016 and then some of that under construction this 2017, so call it 3 to 4 years a snapshot there. And the yield is in the double-digit area around 10%. That took us over a decade in the tower \u2013 on the tower side. And that kind of yield on invested capital is well in excess of our cost of capital and provides a terrific return. Now, we certainly don\u2019t think we are done in Chicago. We are early days on this. And so we think the yields and returns continue to expand well beyond what we underwrote when we invested that capital.","Walter Piecyk","So, I mean as a rule of thumb if 5 went to 10, presumably, your returns would be much higher than 20%, right? It has to scale up from there, I would think right?","Jay Brown","That\u2019s exactly right.","Walter Piecyk","Okay. And then just one last \u2013 just a little pushback on the urban versus kind of suburban being more expensive, if that\u2019s the case, why wouldn\u2019t every operator just opt for someone that actually already had fiber in the market rather than go with someone that had to build new stuff?","Jay Brown","The answer is that there is rarely anything there.","Walter Piecyk","In the urban part of Chicago, I would think that there is fiber running up and down the streets.","Jay Brown","Yes, this fiber is purpose-built in locations that there is not a capacity of existing fiber to be able to handle these small cell nodes. There are other places where we have utilized some leased fiber where there was some existing fiber in the ground. Obviously, that\u2019s a more cost effective opportunity. But the vast majority of what we are doing, there is not fiber in the ground to provide this. And if there is fiber in the ground, there is not nearly enough capacity to be able to handle small cells.","Walter Piecyk","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Dan Schlanger","I would also say that we agree with you that when we have fiber in the ground like now you can see in Chicago, we have a great advantage of getting more small cells on that as opposed to somebody coming in and building because of all the things Jay just talked about and you just mentioned is we have an advantage at this point and we expect to see leasing on that fiber. And where we don\u2019t and have seen where other people have the tremendous amount of fiber that will be utilized for small cells, we understand the disadvantage we are at and will at times choose not to go into those markets. So, I think probably what you are talking about is the competitive dynamic around these things and we feel like we have a great position competitively both from our capability standpoint, but also from our footprint standpoint to really accelerate the growth in this business.","Walter Piecyk","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take the next question from Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.","Michael Bowen","Okay, thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. Question, I may have missed it, but have you divulged any number of tenants per small cell site or can you give us any thoughts on if not kind of where you might see that going in both the near and the distant future and kind of the technology around it and how well that\u2019s working? And then with regard to the carriers, we have been hearing obviously a lot of chatter around pressure from the carriers trying to reduce revenue escalators. Are these current conversations happening? Are they not happening? Can you give us any idea on \u2013 I understand you talked about the value proposition and I get all that, but trying to get an idea as to whether this is something that might be imminent? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Yes, Michael. Appreciate the questions. We haven\u2019t disclosed the number of tenants on small cells. We have focused as you heard from Dan\u2019s comments on yield and return on the investments that we have made. So, I think you are going to continue to hear us mention that, that way you can look at the financial statements and see the expansion of that yields. We think that\u2019s the best way to judge it given how much the economics vary on a market-by-market basis. Number of nodes may not be really indicative of the returns. So, we are focused much more on the capital investment and then what the return of that capital investment is. On your second question around the carriers and conversations, as I mentioned a little earlier, we have seen no change in the pricing constructs with our tenants. And given the value proposition that we provide for those carriers with the cost to lease the assets of something in and around a little bit less than 3%, we think that model continues to hold well into the future.","Michael Bowen","Okay, thanks.","Jay Brown","You bet. Operator, let\u2019s take one more question.","Operator","Alright. Our final question today comes from Michael Hodel with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Michael Hodel","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just had a question on the Chicago map again going back to that. There are certain areas where I would have expected to see maybe a little bit more density actually, think of a market like [indiscernible] we have an affluent suburb that\u2019s urban in nature and I am kind of getting back to the competitive dynamic question. Is this a situation where the carriers are bidding out kind of neighborhood by neighborhood and there are certain areas where you haven\u2019t been able to win the business or is this just a matter of progression? And then also going back to the idea that in some areas the local phone company or cable company might have existing infrastructure that would be more efficiently leveraged, is it fair to say that in those markets where a Verizon or an AT&T has built more fiber like a FioS type of neighborhood that takes one potential customer out of the mix for you guys?","Jay Brown","On your first question, I would just say we are not done yet. So, I think you are just seeing the progression of the build-out of wireless networks using small cells. And so we would share your view that over time as we look at that map, we think there will be an increase in density. And if you look at some of the suburbs that you pointed out [indiscernible], we would expect that there will be, over time, greater density of both fiber and nodes in those areas. On your second question, again, this goes back to existing fiber and the capacity of that fiber to provide this kind of solution. It takes a lot of capacity of fiber. And generally speaking, the residential fiber that\u2019s used for products like you mentioned is not going to have enough capacity to handle small cells. So, if it does, it\u2019s a great solution and that would be the lowest cost alternative that \u2013 typically that is not a competitor really in our space for small cells.","Michael Hodel","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Jay Brown","Well, I just want to thank everyone for joining this morning. There maybe a few folks that we weren\u2019t able to get to your questions. Obviously, feel free today to reach out to us. We would be happy to take the questions offline and answer anything we didn\u2019t get to. We are excited about how the business was performing and what we are seeing and look forward to catching up with you early in the New Year to talk about fourth quarter results.","Operator","And thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I would like to thank everyone for your participation and have a great day."],"6114":["Crown Castle International Corp.

Welcome to the Crown Castle International Q2 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today, July 25, 2013.","I will now turn the conference over to Fiona McKone, VP of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Fiona McKone","Thanks, Angel. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us as we review our second quarter 2013 results. With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will discuss throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements and information based on management's current expectations.

Tables reconciling such non-GAAP financial measures are available under the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay A. Brown","Thanks, Fiona, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a few summary comments as outlined on Slide 3, and then I'll go through our results and outlook in greater detail. As you've seen from our press release, we had an excellent second quarter, exceeding the high end of our previously-issued guidance for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. We continue to make good progress integrating the T-Mobile towers and are substantially complete with the integration of the said [ph] acquisition. The strong year-to-date results and our expectations for the second half of the year allow us to meaningfully increase our 2013 outlook for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.","Turning to Slide 4. During the second quarter, we generated site rental revenue of $617 million, up 19% from the second quarter of 2012. Site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenues less the cost of operations, was $438 million, up 13% from the second quarter of 2012. Further, our network services significantly exceeded our expectations, contributing $48 million in gross margin compared to the $28 million in the second quarter of 2012, reflecting the continued level of network upgrade activity in the market.","Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2013 was $444 million, up 17% from the second quarter of 2012. AFFO was $304 million, up 41% from the second quarter of 2012, and adjusted funds from operations per share was $1.04, up 41% from the second quarter of 2012. We significantly exceeded AFFO in the second quarter compared to our outlook issued in April 2013, primarily due to approximately $12 million more contributions from services than expected, approximately $2 million of nonrecurring items in site rental revenue and higher-than-expected contributions related to reimbursements for wireless infrastructure expenditures necessary to accommodate carrier equipment, which is directly related to the increase in leasing activity, which I will elaborate upon in a few minutes.","Turning to Slide 5. During the second quarter, we invested $228 million in activities related to our core business. We spent $138 million on capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $27 million on our land lease purchase program. Since we began this important effort, we have completed over 14,000 individual land transactions. As of today, we own or control, for more than 20 years, the land beneath towers, representing approximately 77% of our gross margin.","We believe this activity is a core competency of Crown Castle, and we continue to enjoy significant success with this program, as evidenced by the fact that, today, 36% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own, up from less than 15% in January of 2007. Further, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 33 years. We continue to focus a significant amount of effort and capital on purchasing land beneath our towers and extending our ground leases.","Of the remaining capital expenditures, we spent $10 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $101 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures. Our revenue-generating capital expenditures consisted of $66 million on existing sites and $35 million on the construction of new sites, primarily the construction of small-cell networks. Additionally, we spent $15 million on acquisitions during the second quarter.","Also during the second quarter, we purchased approximately 1.1 million of our common shares for $75 million or at an average price of approximately $70 per share. Since 2003, we have spent $2.8 billion to purchase approximately 102 million of our common shares and potential shares at an average price of $27.45 per share. Without this significant investment in our shares, our existing share count would be more than 1\/3 higher our current shares outstanding.","Importantly, during the same period of time, we have more than tripled the size of our tower portfolio and developed a significant number of small-cell networks. Additionally, during the second quarter, we refinanced the existing $1.58 billion Term Loan B and effectively lowered the rate on the loan by 75 basis points, saving approximately $12 million in annual interest expense. We ended the second quarter of 2013 with total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 6x, down from approximately 6.3x at the time of the T-Mobile tower acquisition in November of 2012. As of June, adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense was 3.7x.","Moving to the outlook for full year 2013 on Slide 6. We have meaningfully increased full year 2013 outlook from what we provided in April, increasing adjusted EBITDA by $28 million and AFFO by $61 million, primarily based on our year-to-date results. I'm delighted with the performance of our business and our increased expectations for the balance of 2013. We now expect 2013 year-over-year site rental revenue growth of 17%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% and AFFO per share growth of 34%. We expect to augment our AFFO growth through opportunistic investments and activities such as share repurchases, tower acquisitions, new site construction and land purchases. Consistent with our past practice, our outlook does not include the benefit from these expected investments.","As we noted in the press release, based on currency movements, we decreased our expected contribution from our Australian operations for full year 2013 outlook by approximately $8 million for site rental revenue and by $6 million for adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.","As shown on Slide 7, for 2013, we expect to generate approximately $1.2 billion of AFFO and invest approximately $500 million on capital expenditures related to the purchases of land beneath our towers, the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites, including small-cell networks. Ignoring our borrowing capacity, the portion of our AFFO after expected capital expenditures represents $175 million per quarter of cash flow that we could invest in activities related to our core business, including share repurchases, tower acquisitions, new site constructions and land purchases. As such, we remain focused on investing our cash in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share. I believe that this level of capital investments can add between 3% and 5% to our organic AFFO per share growth rate on an annual basis.","In summary, we had an excellent second quarter as we continued to execute around our core business, and we're very excited about the balance of 2013. Additionally, during the second quarter, we stepped up our preparations for our anticipated future REIT conversion and have engaged accounting and legal advisors to assist us in this effort. Currently, we have approximately $2.7 billion of net operating losses, and I expect we'll convert to a REIT no later than the exhaustion of these NOLs. Based on our internal models, I believe we'll consume the entirety of our NOLs by late 2016 or early 2017.","Before I turn the call over to Ben, I would like provide some additional color on prepaid rent, which has been a popular topic of discussion with investors since our first quarter earnings. In our press release yesterday, we provided additional disclosure regarding prepaid rent related to our site rental revenues, which details the amount of prepaid rent and amortization included in AFFO. By way of example, on Slide 8, we show a single lease we added this quarter to a tower just north of Phoenix, Arizona, and the associated prepaid rent we received in connection with the addition of this tenant to our tower.","Our tenant leases typically have 2 rental components: a monthly rent and a prepaid rent. The prepaid rent reflects a carrier's contribution towards the capital expenditure necessary to modify the tower to accommodate the additional carrier equipment associated with the new lease. This contribution can either be made as prepaid rent or incorporated into the recurring monthly rent we receive from the carrier. Since the very early days of our business, our customers have contributed to the required tower modification as they install additional equipment on our towers. We would expect this pricing construct to continue as long as carriers are adding equipment to our towers.","Consistent with GAAP accounting standards, both rental components, regardless of when cash payments are received, are straight-lined over the term of the lease, as reflected on Slide 8 and shown in the GAAP revenue line on the graph. As the chart indicates in this example, the GAAP revenue, shown by the orange line, is flat for each of the years over the 10-year term of the lease, and is calculated as the average of the prepaid rent and all contracted future rent payments. The cash received, shown by the blue bars, reflects the prepaid rent in year 1, along with the monthly rent payments, with contracted escalators in future years. As such, our AFFO metric reflects the impact of the cash bar shown on the chart, while our adjusted EBITDA metric reflects the impact of the solid line on the graph.","Moving back to a high level on Slide 9. As you can see from our press release, our current amount of site rental revenues on a GAAP basis are greater than the cash amounts we are currently receiving for site rental revenues, inclusive of prepaid rent. As we have shown in the past, we have graphed all of our existing tenant leases for years 2013 through 2022, showing the expected reported amounts for GAAP purposes, and their respective cash receipts. Similar to the single lease example, we have shown we expected GAAP site rental revenue as a solid line and the expected cash receipts as bars.","As you can see from the graph, we expect that, beginning in about 2017, our cash receipts from tenant leases will exceed the amount of reported site rental revenue. This is, as you would expect, given the average life of the leases across the entire portfolio, currently approximately 8 years, suggesting the crossover should be in approximately 4 years or 2017, as the graph illustrates. I should note that the graph only shows existing contracted revenue stream, and prepaid rent is not included in this analysis for years 2014 and beyond, as it is associated with new leasing activities. However, prepaid rent could accelerate the timing of when cash receipts will actually exceed reported site rental revenue, as illustrated by the impact of prepaid rent in 2013.","We continue to think it is helpful to include prepaid rent in our AFFO metric, as we believe that it helps investors understand the timing of the cash generated by our business. The nominal amount of prepaid rent has increased over the last couple of years, as we have significantly increased the number of assets that we own and we have seen a meaningful increase in leasing activities, both from new leases and amendments to existing leases. In 2013, our outlook suggests that prepaid rent, net of amortization, will be approximately 9% of our 2013 AFFO, which is the same percentage of contribution we saw in 2012. I hope you find this additional disclosure and extended explanation helpful.","Back to the big picture and in summary, we had a terrific second quarter, and I'm very excited about the balance of 2013 as we continue to execute around our core business and make investments we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Thank you, Jay, and thanks again to everybody joining us on the call. As Jay just mentioned, we had an excellent second quarter, exceeding our outlook for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. And we are excited about our business as we look to the balance of the year. As you know, there's a significant amount of activity in our industry currently, as all 4 major U.S. wireless carriers are engaged in major network upgrades simultaneously, and we're enjoying a significant ramping of leasing activity, as reflected in our increased 2013 guidance.","As we've noted in the press release, we saw new revenue from tenant additions almost double in the second quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter of 2012. In fact, an important component of these new tenant additions, first time installs or co-locations, are up 2.5x for the first half of 2013 compared to the first half of 2012, reflecting the shift in activity towards inflow sites. This densification activity is the expected second wave of the LTE network deployment and provides us with a longer runway of expected future growth as carriers strive to improve network quality and to add capacity through cell splitting in the face of continued growth in mobile technology demand. Given the urban concentration of our sites, there's 74% of our sites in the top 100 markets, where we expect the majority of network densification to occur. We are very excited about our prospects as this next wave of leasing materializes.","From a macro perspective, the trends underlying the phenomenal growth in wireless data continue unabated, and carrier capital spending plans reflect that reality. In the first quarter of 2013, U.S. mobile data revenues grew 14% year-over-year to reach $21 billion, and are expected to reach $90 billion for the full year 2013. Recent carrier contract terms that bring forward the ability of consumers to switch handsets earlier is expected to result in even faster adoption of the newest smartphones and other connected devices, which typically offer greater breadth of applications and faster connectivity, leading to even more consumption of data.","Research from Google shows that smartphones continue to drive consumers' wireless purchases, with 35% of respondents in a new survey saying that they purchased their phone to obtain the latest and greatest device, up from 25% last year. Smartphone adoption continues to fuel the growth in mobile data, with mobile data consumption at some operators averaging over 1 gigabyte per month, already bumping up against established data tiers, with some devices averaging close to 2 to 3 gigabytes per month. In fact, in Verizon's recent results, they noted that 33% of their postpaid subscriber base is on their LTE network and already consumes 59% of their total data traffic.","As CTIA recently reported, for the last 6 months of 2012, data traffic was up 59%, and for the full year 2012, data traffic was up 69% compared to 2011. And Cisco continues to estimate that U.S. mobile data traffic will grow nine-fold from 2012 to 2017. Further, the expanding LTE networks are expected to accelerate the growth of computing devices, including smartphones and tablets, over the next several years, as well as countless machine-to-machine applications, including connected automobiles. Increasing wireless capacity and broadband speeds driving more data usage and applications built for a mobile environment is a continuing reality.","Before I turn the call over for questions, I want to spend just a minute on LTE and where we think we are in the cycle. To help provide a framework for LTE build-out and our expectations for the longer runway of growth that we see, it is useful to compare how 4G LTE subscriptions are trending versus 3G subscriptions in the early days of that technology's rollout. For the initial 8 quarters, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010 through the third quarter of 2012, LTE subscriptions significantly outpaced the initial 8 quarters of 3G, which began in the first quarter of 2003, both in terms of growth rate and absolute numbers. Estimates are that total LTE subscribers could exceed 180 million by the end of this year and 260 million by 200 -- 2017, with the total number of LTE customers representing 70% of all U.S. mobile subscriptions by 2017.","Further, as each of the carriers have discussed publicly, the process of building LTE coverage and capacity is a multiyear commitment. We are very pleased to be playing an integral part in each of the big 4 U.S. carriers' LTE deployment plans and network densification needs for the long term. We have a unique portfolio of sites and capabilities that we are bringing to bear every day to assist carriers in realizing their plans.","Further, the network densification needs of the carriers will be accomplished by both macro cells and small cells. Indeed, small cells are an integral part of the LTE operators' network strategy. As the leader in small-cell networks, we are seeing tremendous growth in this part of our business, with organic leasing growth on small cells tracking well above our expectations. And we're excited to be investing for growth in this area. While small cells represent a small percentage of our overall site rental revenue, we expect and are seeing growth from small cells contribute significantly more than their relative size, as we've talked about on previous calls.","So to wrap up, our strategy remains unchanged. We're the largest wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S. with an urban-centric portfolio, where leasing activity and demand for mobile technology is the highest. We remain focused on the U.S. market, the largest and fastest-growing wireless market in the world, where the ability of the wireless carriers to make profitable investments is most apparent and barriers to entry remain high. As consistently demonstrated in our results, we believe our well-located tower portfolio and the ability to execute for customers allows us to drive the opportunity in the U.S. market. Leveraging our experienced management team, customer relationships and services offerings across our unrivaled tower footprint, together with our leadership in small-cell networks, positions us to be the provider of choice, as carriers continue to enhance their network to meet ever-increasing wireless demand.","We believe providing carriers with access to our 30,000 sites, extensive small cells and fiber resources through a shared infrastructure model, remains the most efficient means of delivering mobile technology to consumers. I'm excited about the significant growth we are experiencing in our business and how we are positioned for the runway of growth we anticipate in the future.","So in closing, we had an excellent second quarter and look forward to the balance of the year and beyond.","And with that, operator, we're pleased to turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Mr. Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was interested in the small cell aspect of the business. And as you expand that platform, how much of that is leveraging your existing fiber footprint versus requiring the additional expansion, not just of fiber laterals but the fiber backbone itself? And then, secondly, I was interested in the T-Mobile, Metro PCS integration and what you're seeing on that in your -- on your tower asset.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure, Jon. Thanks for the question. On the small cell side, we're seeing a significant uptake in co-location, if you will, on existing fiber plant and networks through systems that we have. As we've talked about before, it's a long runway to build new. We are working on that and actively engaged in a very significant build effort to add additional capacity and additional networks. But a very significant component of what we're seeing is, as we would affectionately call it in the tower business, co-location. It's not quite that simple in small cells, because it can either be in that same box or it can be next pullover [ph], as we've talked about and demonstrated with many of you in the past. But the financial reality is the same. And so we're seeing a very significant amount of co-locations on the small-cell networks and are very excited about what we see there. Again, having that plant, if you will, of embedded fiber in the networks up and running is very key to being able to deliver, really, any kind of speed to market to satisfy a need for a customer in an urban area, so that's proving to be very valuable. Next, with respect to T-Mobile and Metro PCS, I think they're just beginning to sort of get their heads around what they have. We certainly anticipate, on the small-cell side, that's continuing, upgrading for the different additional frequencies that are required there. But we expect that's going to continue as it has in the past, with additional opportunity on the T-Mobile side. On the tower side, I think we've disclosed -- Jay, we've gone through sort of what the overlap is. You might want to refresh everybody on that.","Jay A. Brown","Total exposure to Metro is about 4% of our consolidated revenues, and the overlap is somewhere in the neighborhood of about 3%. And term remaining, we still have several years on those leases. So as Ben mentioned, Jon, it's probably too early for us to have any view as to do we see them renew the equipment in the overlap site. We'll just -- we'll have to see how it goes. But at least, Jon, you have the bookends then you can model it as you think appropriate.","W. Benjamin Moreland","And given the term of those remaining Metro leases and the pace at which we're adding equipment and additional RAD centers, on occasion, for carriers, we'll just have to wait and see what that ultimately looks like when we get to the end of those leases.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Finally, as Sprint starts to wrap its arms around the 2.5 frequencies from Clearwire and then build that out, can you remind us, given the natural [indiscernible] that you have in place, to what extent that triggers extra revenue for you?","W. Benjamin Moreland","With the 2.5, it depends on what's up on the site. But generally, I would say it's a relatively minor revenue event, given their Network Vision equipment and the compatibility of that spectrum built in. Again, we think it is some incremental, but probably not of the magnitude you'd see on a typical amendment cycle, because that equipment is compatible with that 2.5 already. We do expect we'll see that the Clearwire sites that are built for LTE that there were some coordination there with Sprint, as you would expect. We anticipate that those sites continue. And then, again, the overlap sites, we'll have to see, over time, how that plays out when we reach the natural end of the Clearwire licenses. I believe that's, again, about 1% of overlap in the company.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mr. Simon Flannery.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just continuing on the Sprint situation, I think you'd said in the past, you expected about 3% of the impact from the iDEN decommissioning next year. Have you had any sort of further color from Sprint, as certainly the network is a big focus? Or are you -- they going to take those sites down, might they repurpose them or might it be delayed? And secondly, Jay, on the REIT conversion. You talked in the past about leverage. Your leverage is down to 6x. Do you still want to get that down to around 5x before you convert?","Jay A. Brown","Sure, on the first question, the exposure that we currently have to iDEN is -- makes up approximately 3% of revenues, which we think is the bookend impact of the agreement that we struck with Sprint several years ago. They have the ability, over calendar years 2014 and 2015, to remove that on a ratable basis. And we -- at this stage, we don't really have perfect clarity on what they're going to do there. They may decide ultimately to renew some of those installations or they may decide to remove the equipment, as they have the contractual right to do. And I think we'll have to get into those years to really understand where it's going to come out. But that's -- that could be the impact over the next 2 years on a consolidated basis. With regards to REIT conversion, as we did note in the press release and I alluded to in my comments, we certainly stepped up the amount of effort that we've made on that front, and we're working diligently towards taking the steps that will be necessary for us to make the REIT conversion over the next couple of years. And with regards to how we think about that, relative to leverage, I think we've been pretty clear in the past that we think there's value in being, at the corporate level, an investment-grade rated credit. We think that gives us access to capital and ultimately, has a positive benefit on the cost of equity. So I wouldn't describe it as necessarily a bright line or something that we have to do or need to do prior to REIT conversion. And I think, longer term, we think it's appropriate and helpful to the cost of equity to bring that down, if we achieve that investment-grade credit rating. So I think it could be something where we get there prior to REIT conversion. It could be also something that, as we're converting into a REIT, we have a plan of deleveraging to get down to that level. Now I -- whenever we talk about this subject about target level of leverage and how we deploy leverage, it's always, I think, a bit of a relative measure against what are the opportunities in front of us and what is the cost of the debt. We obviously went above -- our long-term targeted level of leverage has been 4 to 6x for a number of years. We went above that level in order to acquire the T-Mobile assets, but that was the right decision. We were able to acquire another 7,000 towers and didn't issue any shares associated with that acquisition. We're able to do it with a very low cost of debt and long-dated maturities on the debt. And so I would say it's a target for us, but it's always relative to what is the opportunity. And historically, we've used our leverage capacity to both buy assets and to buy stock, based on what the prices of our stock and assets were, as well as managing the balance sheet. So it's -- I wouldn't draw any bright lines, but I think the targeted range is where you have seen us operate, and probably in the years forward, as we convert to a REIT, it moves us towards the lower end of the range so that we are able to accomplish getting an investment-grade credit rating.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. David Barden.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess 2. So first, Jay, obviously, I think that there's a lot of excitement about what's going on in the wireless industry. There's a lot of energy going on into network builds. And I think the stock price today is reacting a little bit to a sense that there's a lack of that energy being realized on Crown's part in the revenue -- at the site rental revenue numbers. Kind of hitting the midpoint of the guidance is good, but it doesn't seem to necessarily reflect how much activity there is going on in the market. I guess, taking out one-timers, first quarter was $611.4 million, 2Q was $614.8 million, so that's only $3.5 million. But then, as I look at the end of the year, you've got -- doing the math on your full year guidance, you're looking at something like $11 million or $12 million of sequential revenue growth in 4Q. So can you kind of map out a little bit for us what's happening in these numbers, why the growth looks anemic now and kind of really ramps up in the back part of the year? And then the second part is kind of following up on the leverage and the capacity question. There is a sense that there are several big deals to be done, not just overseas, but also domestically, potentially AT&T, as well as maybe some large private companies. What is your capacity to do a deal size-wise right now, and your comfort level on leverage?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. Dave, thanks for the questions. On the first question about sequential growth, I think it's pretty typical in our industry to see activity during the course of the year ramp, and that's certainly the case as we look at our 2013 expectations. We are seeing more leasing activity in the second quarter than what we saw in the first quarter and expect more activity in the back half of the year than what we saw in the first half of the year. So it's a term that's thrown around a lot in our industry, that the year has become back-end loaded with regards to sequential growth. And it's certainly a period, as you've pointed out from the numbers, that, that's going to be the case again this year. The GAAP numbers, and you've adjusted them as you talked about them, but certainly, as you look at our sequential growth, you have to adjust for the FX, I think, to get to normalized growth, which you did in your comments. And I think you can see in the back half of the year, the growth that we've been talking about, both in terms of leasing activity and applications and new installations that are going on the towers. So I think you've correctly identified it, and it's a function of how the carriers deploy their network in the early part of the year, both their budgets and what they're planning on doing in the year, and then you'd see more activity in the back half of the year than maybe in the first half of the year. And so sequential growth in revenues and EBITDA follow that trend line.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Let me just -- before I get to your second question, the -- also, if you recall on the first quarter call, we talked about new revenue leasing picking up dramatically over last year. That is continuing to happen, as we've mentioned in our comments, but that really started from January. And so really, it's a ramping effect that you see throughout the year. And based on our pipeline, we put out the guidance that we did, which implies significant growth. David, you mentioned about some acquisitions, and basically, what I would say on the acquisition front is, just as we've always done, we are constantly evaluating, from a capital allocation perspective, the ability to acquire assets and provide additional growth in AFFO per share against buying our own shares. And so it's always a relative tradeoff. And as you've seen over time, as Jay mentioned in his comments, we've taken 1\/3 of the share count out of the company in the last few years. At the same time, we've tripled the size of the portfolio. So we're very comfortable doing both. But we will look very carefully at what maximizes long-term growth rates, and act accordingly. And that's how we've acted for a number of years and certainly, would expect that's how we'll act going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mr. Rick Prentiss from Raymond James.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just one quick follow-up on the REIT topic. You mentioned how in earnest it's been stepping up the pace. As you think about paying a dividend and converting to a REIT, any thoughts on when the accumulated earnings and profitability would have to be paid out or possibly paying a dividend before turning into a REIT?","Jay A. Brown","I would separate the REIT conversion from the capital allocation decision around whether we pay dividends or buy back stock. And so I think as we talk about it, you should view our comments as those are 2 separate decisions that we would make. On the REIT conversion and how we think about it, I would anticipate -- when we talk about converting, about exhausting the net operating losses in late 2016 or early 2017, I would expect that we'll convert to a REIT prior to accumulating a significant amount of operating or taxable income that we would need to distribute upon conversion. And so I don't think there will be a date upon which we're making a significant payout of accumulated earning in order to convert to a REIT. On the second part of the question around capital allocation and paying a dividend, we could certainly do that as a C Corp today. We have -- as you know, Rick, had a lot of conversations about this and talked a lot about it. When you look at the growth rates achieved in this business, and I think no matter how you want to look at cash flow metric on a per-share basis, our business is growing at about 30% year-over-year. And we think buying back the shares is a phenomenal investment relative to the alternatives. And so we have continued to stay on that and have done it for a number of years consistently. And I think at this point, we think that's the best path to go. But there will come a day when we're paying a dividend and ultimately, be in a REIT structure, and we'll look forward to that day as well. And between now and any time when we do pay a dividend, the aim is to get cash flow per share as high as we possibly can to maximize what that dividend will be.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the second question is on Slide 9 of the presentation, where you showed kind of existing U.S. tenant leases. Your guidance, I think, for leasing revenue for this year is around $2.475 billion. Looking at that slide, the expected reported revenue from existing tenant leases, obviously, they're not full scale there, looks to be noticeably lower than that. Is that kind of tying back to David's question about are we expecting some ramp-up in the second half of the year? And then also, looking into 2014 and '15, just trying to think through what that graph is showing us.","Jay A. Brown","Sure. We're showing you just our U.S. business, because the vast majority of prepaid rent comes from our U.S. business. And so the numbers that are shown there would be our U.S. tenant leases. If you were to include Australia, then it would match up to our consolidated numbers and obviously, be considerably higher.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. And then one follow-up on Jonathan's question. On the Sprint, Softbank, Clearwire item, if Softbank does do the $8 billion spending a year at Sprint, this year, and does another $8 billion next year, it's sounds like they want to deploy a lot more 2.5 gigahertz sites. Then, in your answer to the previous question, are you assuming that you will not get much benefits to that? Or was that a different answer?","Jay A. Brown","No, no, that's a different answer. I mean, I'm talking about if they go back to the Network Vision overlay and add 2.5, many of those sites configured for that today, so that would not be a significant revenue event. I, like you, continue to expect that they are going to continue to add capacity and build that network to compete. And so we would fully expect -- in our comments around network densification, you're going to see Sprint right in there with everybody else, adding additional sites that they're not previously on. And so this runway, we talked about extended future growth around co-location, absolutely extends to Sprint and our expectations for what that brings in the future.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. That's beyond the terms of the existing MLA. That's [indiscernible] nice revenue, too. So if they do start spending that significant CapEx, the lag time is maybe late this year, but more likely some nice benefit in '14?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. In fact, you mentioned our presold agreements. If you -- as we look at this year versus last year and current run rates, we were down by about half on the amount of new applications that are attributed to existing presold MLAs. So that is tailing off, as we would expect, as we reach the end of those sort of initial LTE overlays. And then the new revenue items, whether it be a new co-lo or an amendment on a site that's outside the scope of those MLAs, those are ramping dramatically, and those are what we talked about doubling year-over-year. So that mix is changing in a very material way in our company, such that the overall activity is up as well. But certainly, from a revenue side, the new revenue items, both co-los and amendments outside the scope of the existing presold MLAs, are ramping very significantly.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I think it's a key point for the market to understand as far as what you're seeing in your guidance revenue versus what could be coming shortly.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Right, right.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Mr. Brett Feldman from Deutsche Bank.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was hoping we can maybe just dial in a bit to where you see the highest potential returns on the use of your cash right now. And there are 2 things I'm interested in getting a little more color on. The first is you've talked a lot about network densification, and so I'm wondering whether you're seeing a renewed opportunity to increase the rate at which you develop new towers to take advantage of that, because historically, you've generated your highest returns off of new tower development. And then secondarily, your stock, obviously, has underperformed in the market. Are you thinking that maybe now is the time to step on the gas with buybacks?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, Brett, let me take a crack at that. With the co-location activity in the market that we're talking about and the expected multiyear runway that we think that entails for all 4 major carriers in the U.S., building towers is certainly something we are revisiting. We have really come out of that business in a significant way over the last 3 years for obvious reasons, because most of the activity, borderlining on all of the activity, has been around amendments, around LTE. I would tell you that it's certainly on the table. It's something we're looking at. I would not be surprised if we even see us building some sites in the U.S. in the future, again to capture that new co-location densification we see going forward. Other than that, high-returning activities, we're quite pleased with our stock purchases over the years. We think we've done extremely well on, obviously, evaluating the growth opportunity in the business, discounting that against the market view, and then acting accordingly. But at the same time, we are constantly looking at acquisitions and opportunities to grow the business because we are still very bullish on the long-term growth aspects of our current assets and many that we could potentially acquire. That was true with NextG in the small-cell business. And we have been very pleased with what we've seen to date tracking originally -- above our original business plan. Co-location activity on an existing asset, whether it be a small-cell network or the towers, is, obviously, probably the highest-returning activity there is in the industry. And we are very gratified to see that happening on the small-cell side, as well as towers, as we've talked about. So it's really going to be more the same. We are constantly running sort of a dynamic comparison around where are we currently valued based on our best estimates for our own future growth against other assets maybe in the marketplace. And we expect to act accordingly, and we expect to do that in size, given the fact that we're generating, as Jay alluded to, about $700 million of excess cash flow, beyond what I would call sort of normal CapEx that we're doing on land purchases and tower augmentations and small-cell builds, as we mentioned. So we've got a lot of money to put to work. And as you can tell, that's a very significant component of our overall growth over time. And back to Rick's question, I certainly don't want to trade that flexibility to be opportunistic for a dividend prematurely. There's certainly a time coming when we'll pay a very significant dividend, we expect, based on the lack of tax shield, because the depreciation will be exhausted. And so that's just the reality. But in this interim period, as Jay was alluding to, I think we have an opportunity to grow AFFO per share either through shrinking the denominator or adding to the numerator, and we're going to continue to focus on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amir of Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","One of the topics that you folks have mentioned that you're benefiting from right now is this sort of network densification. As you're building out sort of additional capacity to support traffic for carriers, I was wondering if you could highlight sort of the tradeoff with the small-cell choice versus sort of cell splitting or augmenting the macro network. It seems as though there's a bit of debate going on in the industry as to whether or not small-cell capacity would offset some of the macro cell capacity. And I was wondering if you could give us some color with your experience on what you're seeing in the market today.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, the vast majority of what we're seeing around the small-cell augmentation or densification that's happening where small-cell networks are, so co-location, as we've referred to it, on a small-cell basis, is occurring in places where macro sites really are too large or unavailable. So your -- the purpose is to repurpose the spectrum in a smaller cell, if you will, in an urban environment, where the usage patterns are very, very significant and capacity is continuing to be challenged. Where there's an existing small-cell network available, that's a very efficient way to add it and continue to get the maximum resource out of that spectrum, because you're reusing it in very small cells, if you will. In many places, though, where that's the need, there is not a small-cell network available. And absolutely, adding additional sites, if it's an urban setting, potentially a rooftop or adding to macro sites is a preferred approach. It's the quickest approach. But Amir, it's really both. I mean, it really depends on what the availability of the infrastructure is in the locations there. And small cells, while we've got a nice business that's growing, it's still very small relative to the overall geography that the carriers are trying to deal with. And so the macro sites, in terms of bang for the buck, it's always more efficient to split a macro site. But I appreciate that in an urban setting, often that's not a choice, or those sites are, in fact, too big, and they need to reuse that spectrum in a smaller cell, which is, in fact, what we ultimately do with a small-cell deployment. So it's really both. And I certainly wouldn't suggest one is cannibalizing the other. It's, frankly, 2 separate issues and 2 tools that they're using to add capacity to the networks.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And so just a follow-up there. I mean it does sound like, based on what you're seeing in the marketplace, that not only is one not cannibalizing the other, but really, this is much more of an incremental opportunity for both you folks and for the carriers to extend their capacity.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Exactly. And again, what's most important is having that existing asset available, whether it be a tower portfolio well-located in markets where that growth is needed, where that capacity enhancement is needed, or having embedded fiber with an existing network, where you can relatively easily add an additional tenant across that existing fiber plant. So the major thing we bring is, obviously, the assets, the portfolios where they need them, and the ability to execute for customers on a timely basis. And that's, in fact, what we're seeing this year significantly ramping.","Jay A. Brown","You could -- and the last thing I'd say is you can certainly see that -- I know most of you listen to our carrier customers' earnings calls, and you can certainly hear that in their tone as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, first, maybe this was addressed, but I don't think it was. Can you talk about what the sort of gross prepaid rent was the last few years? Is 2013 really out of line? Or is this just a little bit bigger than normal?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. It grew meaningfully in 2012, and it's grown, to a lesser extent, from '12 to '13, as the activity that we've been talking about, both in terms of amendment activity for LTE and then as new leasing has begun to pick up. It's been a part of the business, as I mentioned in my comments, since the beginning. So if you go back and look well back into history and you were to adjust for the number of towers that we own and then the leasing activity, what you would see is a graph that ebbs and flows. In some years it's higher, in some years it's lower, related to what leasing activity is going on. And so any period of time, like what we've been in, where there's an increase in activity, you're going to see that prepaid rent number increase.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And as we think about the driver of that, is it more just activity overall or do new tenants sort of drive a higher level of prepaid rents than amendments?","Jay A. Brown","Well, it would be a combination of both. Typically speaking, if there's new leases going on the tower, there is going to be more equipment, and therefore, the structure is going to need -- likely to have greater reinforcing. So I think, generally speaking, you're going to have higher prepaid amounts on new leasing activities, so that would certainly factor into it. The other thing, if you're doing a comparison to history, that would also be true. We talked about the fact that about 75% of the prepaid rent activity is related to towers and 25% is related to small cell. So if we've been building the small-cell business, that wouldn't have been there. If you look back and look at it, say, you were trying to compare it to another high period of activity in the mid-2000s, 2005, 2006, that activity wouldn't have been there. So that would have been another reason why it would be higher today than what it would have been if you're looking back 4 or 5 years ago.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And the tower activity was up from '11 to '12, as well as the addition of the small-cell business?","Jay A. Brown","Yes. Activity increased on towers from -- going into calendar year 2012 and then again, into calendar year 2013. And then, obviously, given the timing of our 2 acquisitions into that space, as well the things that we've built outside of those acquisitions, our exposure to small cells and the size of that business has increased significantly since 2010.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then separately, on the services business, I think I ask this question every quarter. But strong again, a little less strong than last quarter. Should we think about that as being indicative of activity overall? Or does that just sort of -- varies pretty widely?","W. Benjamin Moreland","It does vary, but it's mostly been varying on the upside for a number of quarters, as you can see. A lot of people working very hard on that. Phil, it's been growing. We've been doing additional scope of work on a per-app basis, such as preconstruction, zoning work, all the way through the installs. We've done a very nice job of capturing more of that opportunity within the company as carriers are touching our sites. There's obviously a revenue and margin opportunity that we're capturing. There's also an asset control and sort of high-touch approach that we take to our assets that we think makes being in the service business important for us. And so we are continuing to seek out and gain those opportunities, and it's continuing to grow as it relates to the level of activity going on in the marketplace today. And so we certainly expect that to continue as we see continued leasing.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen from Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","Tower improvement and construction CapEx has been elevated over the last few quarters versus historical absolute and relative to sales levels. I know there's a number of projects, including DAS. How long is this going to last? And when should we start to see -- or is this your normalized sort of CapEx-to-sales ratio? And\/or when will we return back to sort of 2011 and early 2012 levels?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Function of leasing.","Jay A. Brown","Yes. Kevin, I was going to say, it's a function of leasing, and it's a combination of 2 things. If you look at our historical results and you go back to 2011 and look at the 6-year period of time from then, we've tripled the number of towers that we own. So even if activity were constant, the level of improvement, I would expect, would be triple today what it would have been on a historical basis, if you were to look back over time. On top of that, what we're seeing is a significant increase, as we've talked about it, it's in -- depending on how you want to measure it, more than double of activity from 2012 to 2013 when we look at new leases that are going on, on the asset. So it's a combination of growth in assets and a significant increase in leasing activity. As we look forward, the answer has kind of stayed the same, the level of assets stays constant, we would assume, at least, for modeling purposes that you're looking for. And then how much CapEx we spend is going to be a function of what's the leasing activity. And today, we're not here to provide guidance beyond calendar year 2013, but we'd expect that the level of spend would be matched with whatever the activity level is. Obviously, when you compare the whole of it, we do fantastic investments. If you look at -- an average tenant that goes on our tower is paying us in the neighborhood of $2,000 a month to go on an asset. To the extent that we make a capital improvement to hold that asset, and as we've shown, we reinvest it through a significant portion of that capital expenditure. This is a fantastic investment that we have in our business, and we're happy to spend the money and make the sites ready for these additional tenants. It's the highest investment of capital we have on the business.","W. Benjamin Moreland","And then your -- on the construction side, that's dominated -- at least for now, dominated by small-cell network builds that we've talked about. And as I alluded to, we even make it back in the tower-building business as well, depending upon the opportunity we see there. But for now, that number is primarily around the small-cell business, Kevin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So just a clarification. Ben, do you think -- the services revenue here, is this kind of the new normal? I mean, you used to be around $50 million per quarter. Do you think you've built up the infrastructure and you have the customer base so this can kind of stay at this level or grow from here? And I just had another question on LTE also.","W. Benjamin Moreland","I can't represent to you that. I honestly -- we're doing the best we can. We're capturing a lot of opportunities and it's continuing to grow every quarter. But it is completely dependent on application volume and leasing opportunities, and so it's a function of that. And so we see a long runway towards leasing. We've come through a period where we've had all 4 major carriers building out LTE. That mix is going to now shift to augmentation in terms of new cell splitting and new co-locations, as some of the carriers finish their coverage build, their initial coverage build on LTE. So we'll just have to see. We're continuing to look for ways, successfully I should say, to expand the scope of what we're doing with carriers. And so maybe we can manage to see that stay relatively at these levels, even if app volume were to taper off a little bit over time, because we're doing more scope within each application. But it's something we're looking at carefully. And we're managing this, and frankly, going about as fast as we can go right now, given the opportunity out there.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And so with the LTE build, candidly [ph], I would say a lot of the equipment is going on existing leases that were modified. Are we basically done with that process at the end of the year and the new LTE builds and cell splitting will be just absolutely incremental revenue for next year and beyond?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I'd say substantially done this year with AT&T and Verizon, as they have confirmed. And then, we would -- and then we certainly anticipate, as we're continuing to see the pipeline build for them in terms of cell splitting, both on -- both for macro sites, as well as opportunities on the small-cell networks, to augment capacity around LTE as their sort of second wave. And then, as you look into Sprint and T-Mobile talk about their LTE build with Network Vision and their network modernization plan, a little bit further behind, but obviously very committed to delivering that same product for consumers. And so you can just sort of follow down through the Big 4 and see this wave coming, and that's exactly what we've seen. Verizon announcing that they've basically hit $300 million tops, their coverage build is initially complete, and then they're going to come right back and add capacity for all the purposes and reasons that they stated. We anticipate that times 4 because you're going to see that right behind what's happening with AT&T, Sprint and then T-Mobile. And so that mix change, over time, back to your first question about what was augmentation on an existing site, we think that -- we can see it in our numbers. Absolutely, that's tailing off. A lot of that was pre-contracted, if you remember, presold. That's tailing off and then the revenue-generating activity is more than making up for that tail-off.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two, if I may. First, in terms of the prepaid, you've given kind of detail already. But one of the things you noted was that it was -- the breakdown was maybe 25% DAS and 75% towers. And it doesn't seem like DAS is 25% of your revenues. So just understanding if there is a larger component of upfront prepaids associated with DAS relative to the revenue stream versus towers? And then secondly, in terms of activity, again, you've given us a lot of color on the new cell site activity. And I'm wondering if you're seeing amendment spend, the activity there, slow or that activity has kind of been steady and the new cell site activity has been incremental? And then I guess, if you could give us the breakdown of new cell sites versus amendment activity in the quarter, it'd be helpful.","Jay A. Brown","Sure, on your prepaid rent question, 25% of it is DAS related. And while, if you counted the number of assets that we have, we obviously have a much larger portfolio of towers than DAS, we're building and deploying a significant number of small cells. And so we've talked about the fact that while it represents less than 5% of the business, it could be in the neighborhood of about 20% of our growth in calendar year 2014. And we're seeing a very similar thing in terms of the prepaid rent, as it would match where the activity goes. So it's -- while it's a smaller portion of the overall assets, it's a meaningful amount and meaningful contribution to the growth rate that we're seeing in the business.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Jonathan, the only thing that's tailing off on the leasing side is what I mentioned before, which is amendments related to MLA terms that were presold, which would have been the initial wave of LTE upgrades, typically. And so we're continuing to see applications around amendments that are outside the scope of that, microwave dishes and new co-locations grow very significantly. As I mentioned, co-los standalone comparison up 2.5x year-over-year. Total new revenue-generating activity, up sort of double year-over-year. And the only thing tailing off in our activity levels are what was presold, if you will, as we sort of reach -- again, my guess is we're probably 60% or 70% through that presold commitment, if you will, as it tails off.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","We saw another increase to expectations for gross margins in this quarter and also G&A, as a percent of sales, improved. Can we expect these trends to continue from here? And can you also talk a little bit about the drivers of that improvement?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. The gross margin improvements are related to revenue growth, and the cost structure is relatively stable, particularly with regards to towers. As we build and deploy additional small-cell networks, the initial margins of those networks would be lower than our legacy portfolio, so it has a bit of a drag effect. But we've seen great growth there, and the margins are increasing significantly and that obviously helped the overall margins. On the G&A side, as we've ramped the services business and seen the additional activity, we've certainly added additional people in the business to manage that activity. And so I would point you to the fact that it's -- those 2 items are correlated, and we'd expect the G&A line will move to some degree in proportion with what we see from the services business over time.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And one other question on public safety. We've been reading some news that there is some activity on a regional basis. Have you had any discussions with public safety network builds?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, would be the short answer. As you can imagine, we're in the middle of that dialogue, wouldn't elaborate a whole lot yet. And it's certainly not in our leasing, existing or future. But it's nice to see an opportunity out there like that where, with our portfolio that we've assembled, I think we can bring a lot to the table to help them there. And you can assume that we're in the middle of those conversations.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Bowen from Pacific Crest.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to get back to Sprint a little bit. By my numbers, it looks like your revenue is the most exposed to Sprint, and I wanted to find out if you're seeing any pickup of activity over there, given the recent closures of their deals. And I guess, correlated with that, did you see some slowdown in the first half and particularly, in the second quarter? And then I guess, the same thing could be said for T-Mobile and PCS. If you could give us an update on build activity there.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, Michael, we always -- we're a little careful about letting the carriers speak for themselves around specific activity. But let me just say that for the last 2 years, we have been going flat out with Sprint on their Network Vision upgrade, and I would not say there's been any slowdown that we can perceive. We've got a very significant amount of amendment activity work from Network Vision, and we've done a lot of services work there as well. I would anticipate, with the Softbank closing -- obviously, it's early days, but with what they've said publicly, we can anticipate a network build that looks a lot like what you're seeing from others. And so as they get the initial coverage build done on LTE, we'll see significant densification and additional sites added. Again, that sort of needs to finish the first path on coverage build first, but we haven't seen a slowdown. It's been very active. And with T-Mobile, with Metro PCS, obviously, they're going through an integration phase there. We've seen a lot of activity around their network modernization program, and we certainly expect that they're going to make the significant investment required. And we'll see that same sort of movie all over again with T-Mobile.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then one last question, if I could. Obviously, there's been a lot of speculation out there with regard to the large portfolio towers at AT&T, probably less so at Verizon, but I guess, the question is the same for both. If you could talk to us a little bit about what type of towers and whether those towers are attractive, not just to you, but to the tower industry in general? Can you talk about maybe some of the puts and takes there with regard to some of those towers in both their portfolios that they still own?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure. What's attractive -- and you can most recently see this in our T-Mobile example and the towers we acquired from T-Mobile. What's attractive is having a portfolio that's available for co-location, obviously, in the locations where you need the assets, where the densification is going to occur, and that's urban sites, that's top 100 cities, and that's been our focus for the last 10 years. And that's how we've ended up with a portfolio that looks like -- looks as it does. And so our evaluation of really any opportunity, whether -- you mentioned a couple, would always center around the location of the assets and the opportunity that it represents to solve additional needs for other carriers through the occupancy of those sites. And as equipment gets smaller and more creative and the lines even begin to blur between a full macro site and a small cell, I think you'll see the industry getting more creative over time as to what you put on a tower that ultimately solves the carriers' needs, all against the backdrop of the benefit of the shared economics and the sharing of the site, which, again, we think is sort of the compelling thing that we bring to the market. The ability to get carriers on the air and also give them the benefit of sharing the economics of the site, we think, is sort of what makes our industry. And that's how we'll evaluate portfolios in the future.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two, if I may. The first one, a lot of talk about rising interest rates the last few months, and just curious how you may have seen that impact your business. And I guess, more specifically, as rates were rising, did you see that impact deal valuation? And maybe did that actually impact how you are valuing potential tower acquisitions? And then the second question, I know this had been talked about already, but as it relates to cell splitting, can you just remind us what the impact is of that on GAAP? And I guess with you calling out","[Audio Gap]","I'm just trying to understand the impact to the income statement.","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On the first question, the direct impact to our interest expense is relatively minor from rises in interest rates. The vast majority of our existing debt is financed for a long period of time, and it's fixed rate. We do have some exposure to floating-rate debt. Most of that floating-rate debt already has the LIBOR floor, and current LIBOR rates are well below the floor, so we've not seen anything there. Obviously, as you think about buying assets or buying back stock, the cost of the capital is a factor in how we think about that. And so we would adjust, as we go along, how we think about the relative value of assets and stock and purchases of land or building towers. On your second question around the impact of new leases, we have not done any presell agreements related to -- in our GAAP revenue numbers, related to brand-new leases. So the activity that we presold, which we talked about, that we think we've gone through -- gotten through most of that activity, thus far, that we're going to see, related to what was presold, that activity was all amendment-related. So to the extent that a tenant wants to go on a tower they're not currently located on, that would be additive to our growth rate. And my prior comments, I think you could see this in the numbers, the sequential growth in revenues, if you adjust for the onetime items that we've noted for you and adjust for the FX headwind that we're facing in the back half of the year, is meaningful in the back half of the year. And if you look at our leasing, as we look at the numbers, there's significantly more leasing in the back half of the year on a net basis than what we saw in the first half of the year. And so the sequential growth in steps will be -- we would expect to be larger in the back half of the year. As is typically the case in the tower business, that revenue growth is back-end loaded in the calendar year.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Okay, great. Listen, I appreciate everybody hanging with us today. We went a little bit long, about 70 minutes. We have a lot of runway, a lot to get accomplished this year, very much excited about the balance of the year. And thanks for your attention this morning. We'll talk to you on the next call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for participating.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Son Nguyen. Please go ahead.","Son Nguyen","Thank you, Mia, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we discuss our second quarter 2017 results and our announced acquisition of Lightower.","With me on the call this morning are Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. Jay is going to begin with a discussion of the Lightower acquisition, and Dan will follow with a review of our second quarter 2017 results. To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investor section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors section of the Company's SEC filings. Our statements are made as of today, July 19, 2017, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","In addition, today's call includes discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investor section of the Company's website at crowncastle.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Brown","Thanks, Son, and thank you, everyone, for accommodating our change in schedule and joining us on the call early this morning as we discuss the Lightower acquisition and our second quarter results.","As you saw from our press release yesterday afternoon, we have reached an agreement to acquire Lightower, which owns or has rights to approximately 32,000 miles of fiber in top metro markets in the Northeast, including Boston, New York and Philadelphia. Through a series of transactions in recent years and organic investments along the way, we have strategically positioned Crown Castle as the leading shared wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S. across towers, small cells and fiber.","Turning to Slide 4. We believe this portfolio of mission-critical infrastructure will play an important role in helping our customers capitalize on the exponential growth in demand for data and connectivity. As has been our view over the past several years, we see the ownership of deep, dense fiber in top metro markets as a competitive advantage in facilitating small cell deployments in a cost-effective and timely manner.","With the addition of Lightower's premier metro fiber footprint located in several of the most densely populated markets, we are significantly extending our reach by adding a highly complementary footprint that doubles the miles we will have available for small cell deployment.","Further, the acquisition of Lightower aligns with our longstanding focus on allocating capital to increase shareholder value through growing the dividend. Towards this end, we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to our AFFO per share, and as a result, we expect to increase our annual dividend rate by approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per share after closing, subject to our Board's approval.","Additionally, we expect that the Lightower acquisition will enhance our long-term growth rate, allowing us to increase our annual dividend growth target by 100 basis points to 7% to 8%. The expected near and long-term accretion is a reflection of the small cell opportunities we see in front of us as well as the high-quality business and assets we are acquiring in Lightower.","Turning to Slide 5. We have assembled an unparalleled portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure assets that we believe are well positioned to help our customers meet the growing demand for data. Additionally, we have developed industry-leading capabilities to meet the growing small cell demand.","Drawing on our experience with towers we are capitalizing on our first mover advantage to assemble a portfolio where we believe there will be long-term franchise value that will drive significant returns over time through future leasing. We believe the combination of our assets with those of Lightower will represent one of the most extensive and unique footprints of deep dense metro fiber assets assembled today, and this is one of the key drivers of our acquisition.","Pro forma for the Lightower acquisition, we will own or have rights to approximately 60,000 route miles of fiber, making us one of the largest owners of metro fiber in the U.S. Further, with our combined footprint, we will own or have rights to fiber in all of the top 10 and 23 of the top 25 metro markets.","By creating scale in these top markets, we are positioning Crown Castle to meet the needs of our customers looking to us as an infrastructure provider of choice as consumers and businesses in every industry evolve and adapt to a world where mobile is the platform of choice. This ongoing transition to mobile is evident everywhere. Importantly, Crown Castle is positioned to benefit from this long-term trend as our leading portfolio of towers, small cells and fiber will provide the critical infrastructure needed to enable this shift.","As you can see on the maps on Slide 6 and 7, the addition of Lightower will expand our fiber presence with complementary dense metro fiber assets throughout the Northeast. The limited overlap between Lightower's fiber footprint and our existing footprint will give us a large incremental opportunity to deploy small cells in these important markets.","As I mentioned earlier, on Slide 8, is the trend in mobile data demand, which is expected to quadruple by 2021. We expect our portfolio of towers, small cells and fiber to play an essential role in supporting the network densification that will be needed to meet this demand.","As you can see on the slide, our wireless customers are increasingly turning to small cells to augment and further densify their macro network and deploy spectrum closer to their customers to enhance and improve their network quality and capacity. Consistent with what our customers are saying, we are seeing small cell demand accelerate as evidenced by our first quarter announcement of our record 25,000 contracted small cell node pipeline, and we believe the long-term opportunity could match towers in size and return.","Our conviction around the size and attractiveness of the small cell opportunity has grown over time based on the trajectory of activity from our wireless carriers and the returns we have generated to-date. To help give you some additional perspective on why we are so enthusiastic about the opportunity, I wanted to take just a minute and walk you through the returns we have generated to-date across our top three small cell markets: New York City, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.","Across these three markets, we are generating a recurring yield of approximately 11% on the approximately $1.3 billion of total net invested capital to-date. The $1.3 billion includes an allocation of the purchase price from our prior acquisitions of NextG and Sunesys and represents approximately 30% of our total net invested capital in small cells, excluding the Wilcon acquisition that we closed just a few weeks ago.","The incremental growth we have generated to bring these deals up to these levels has been a result of deploying small cells on the fiber we built or acquired in these markets. Given that small cells are in the early stages of adoption, we find the double-digit recurring yields in these markets to be very compelling, and we continue to see significant opportunities to lease these fiber assets up further to also improve our returns over time.","What really excites us is that we believe this success will be replicated across our footprint of now 60,000 miles of metro fiber. To-date, we believe our customers' investments in small cells have been driven by meeting 4G use case demand, and we have underwritten our investments, including Lightower, with this view in mind.","As seen on Slide 8, our carrier customers are also making these investments in small cells today with an eye to the future as they prepare their networks for 5G. As 5G takes shape over the coming years, we believe we will see increasing demand for small cells that will drive additional returns on our investment as further densification occurs.","Turning to Slide 9. In addition to furthering our small cell strategy, Lightower also brings with it high-quality, long-term cash flows and an experienced operating team with a scalable platform that can enhance and supplement our small cell investment. Lightower generates attractive returns on invested capital by providing differentiated fiber solutions that serve high-bandwidth, multi-location customers.","As you can see on the slide, Lightower has delivered consistent revenue growth with attractive margins. As a result of its differentiated service offering and operating discipline, Lightower's portfolio of customer contracts has a weighted average remaining current term of approximately four years, including approximately $2.7 billion of remaining contracted revenues from a high-quality mix of customers consisting of large enterprises, government agencies, health-care providers, educational institutions and carriers.","With this approach, Lightower has been able to attract a diverse customer base while maintaining an almost equal split of revenues between carrier and enterprise customers. Importantly, this approach has also resulted in the vast majority of Lightower's assets and revenues qualifying for REIT status.","We believe the fiber solutions revenues generated by Lightower will allow us to enhance our competitive position in small cells by increasing the opportunities we serve with the underlying fiber assets, thereby improving the already attractive shared economic model we see in our small cell business, both on the fiber we are acquiring and on our existing base of fiber.","Moving on to the transaction details on Slide 10. We have agreed to acquire Lightower for $7.1 billion in cash, representing an EBITDA multiple of approximately 13.5 times. We expect the transaction to close by the end of this year and be immediately accretive to AFFO per share at close.","In our first full-year of ownership, we expect Lightower will contribute $850 million to $870 million in site rental revenues and $510 million to $530 million in adjusted EBITDA. We expect to finance the transaction with a combination of equity and debt that is consistent with our policy of maintaining investment-grade credit metrics.","With the cash flows generated by Lightower and taking into account our anticipated financing, we anticipate increasing our annual common stock dividend rate, subject to approval by our Board, by approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per share at close. Additionally, we expect that the Lightower acquisition will enhance our long-term growth rate, allowing us to increase our annual dividend growth target of 6% to 7% to 7% to 8%.","In short, this is a great acquisition that we think will generate significant value for our shareholders and position us to better serve our customers by expanding our portfolio in some of the best markets in the U.S.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan to go through our second quarter results.","Daniel Schlanger","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thanks again for accommodating our schedule change and joining us on the call early in the morning. I can imagine everyone is focused on our acquisition announcement. We also announced earnings this morning, and our results were very good. We delivered another quarter of positive financial results as our fundamentals for our business remain strong and our team continues to execute at a high level for our customers.","Results for the quarter met or exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. We are pleased with our strong operating results during the first half of the year and the continued healthy leasing activity we are seeing across our infrastructure assets, which we expect to continue through the second half of the year. As a result, we are increasing our full year 2017 outlook at the midpoint for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO to reflect that backdrop and incorporate the contribution from the Wilcon acquisition that closed in late June.","Turning to second quarter 2017 results. As shown on Slide 12, site rental revenues grew approximately 8% or [$66 million] as compared to the same period in 2016, inclusive of approximately 5% growth derived from organic contribution to site rental revenues. The 5% or $42 million of growth from organic contribution of site rental revenues consists of approximately 8% growth from new leasing activity and contracted tenant escalations, net of approximately 3% from tenant non-renewals.","Moving on to investment activities for the quarter. We closed on our $600 million acquisition of Wilcon and invested an additional $301 million in capital expenditures, including $261 million of revenue-generating capital expenditures across towers and small cells that we believe will generate compelling returns and deliver long-term growth in dividends per share.","Consistent with our focus on maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet, we financed the Wilcon acquisition with $442 million in net proceeds from equity issued during the quarter, and the balance was funded with a portion of the proceeds from our inaugural 30-year unsecured bond offering in May. We believe the attractive pricing on this long-term capital of 4.75% reflects the market's recognition of our high-quality cash flows, the long-term nature of our assets and the attractive prospects for our business. Our focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet has positioned us well to invest in our business while providing the flexibility to pursue attractive acquisitions like Lightower.","Turning to other financing activities. We once again returned significant capital to our shareholders during the second quarter with our quarterly common stock dividend totaling $348 million or $0.95 per share, representing growth of 7% on a per-share basis as compared to the same period a year ago. We continue to believe that providing a portion of shareholder returns in the form of a growing dividend stream aligns well with our business, which is characterized by high-quality, long-term recurring cash flows.","Turning now to Slide 13. We are increasing our full-year 2017 outlook at the midpoint for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by $29 million, $15 million and $6 million, respectively.","As you can see on Slide 14, we have increased our outlook primarily to reflect the contribution of the recently closed acquisition of Wilcon. Wilcon is expected to contribute approximately $26 million to site rental revenues, $7 million to site rental cost of operations and approximately $5 million to general and administrative expenses. This contribution is expected to be partially offset by higher financing costs associated with the pre-funding of Wilcon acquisition for two months and an increase of approximately $5 million in interest expense in the normal course of business driven by higher LIBOR rates.","Overall, we are encouraged by the increased pace of leasing we are experiencing on our towers this year. Although given where we are in the year, we do not anticipate the increased activity will meaningfully impact our 2017 results. As we look out further, we remain optimistic about the long runway of growth that remains in front of us as our carrier customers continue to densify their macro networks and deploy additional spectrum, including FirstNet and other spectrum from recent auctions, in order to meet the demand for mobile data and connectivity.","To wrap up, we look forward to building on the strong results through the first half of the year as Crown Castle remains well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term growth trends and data consumption with our leading portfolio of critical wireless infrastructure assets.","With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to David Barden with Bank of America.","David Barden","Hey, guys, thanks and congrats on the deal and the quarter. I guess a few questions, maybe focused on the Lightower deal. First, Jay, I think that there's a lot of questions about kind of \u2013 as you know the lingering questions about the differences between the small cell fiber business and some of the enterprise components that you're acquiring relative to the tower business. So on that, could you talk a little bit about Lightower's historical CapEx intensity, its churn in that business and some of the kind of the growth characteristics that they've been seeing?","And related to the growth, could you talk a little bit about what kind of backlog they might have in terms of the small cell inventory or what kind of the conversations you had with carriers that give you the conviction that there's that incremental growth opportunity that'll inform the dividend outlook? And I guess my last question, if I could, was just on your conversation about the top three markets and the 11% return that you're getting there. Of that 11% return, what percentage of that return is related to the everprise side in the services business versus what is right now the real small cell part of the return that you're generating? Thanks so much.","Jay Brown","Thanks for the question. So high level, let me start with this. As we look at the assets that Lightower ran, and this is really consistent with all of the acquisitions that you've seen us do so far, whether it's FiberNet or Wilcon or Sunesys, we have looked at very specific characteristics around those assets, on dense fiber, dark fiber in metro markets where we believe there's a lot of opportunities for small cells to be deployed across that fiber.","And the key aspect of it, which is reflected in the comments that we're making around the vast majority of the revenues, qualify as good REIT income, and we believe somewhere in the neighborhood of 80% to 85% of the assets in the revenue are good REIT income. The assets are, in essence, passive for us. So we are purely an infrastructure provider providing a pipe and therefore, it's good real estate income.","That passive nature as an infrastructure provider of \u2013 in essence, owning the tollway if you will, or the railroad for the deployment of wireless networks, these assets that we're acquiring in Lightower have those same characteristics, and it's why they're so attractive to us. We find that over time, as we've looked at assets, the revenues tend to be stickier. They tend to be longer dated. And they tend to be very attractive for the deployment of small cells.","With regards to your question around CapEx intensity and churn, et cetera. On the CapEx intensity side, generally, the payback for the deployment of capital, once you start to develop a market, the payback is in the neighborhood of two to three years on the capital that's been deployed. Historically, the business has seen churn in the neighborhood of about 9%, and the payback on the capital obviously, drives the continued investment.","So as you think about the impact of churn and the allocation of capital towards those two things, while we would certainly underwrite it and Lightower has done a good job over time of putting that into the model and thinking about the deployment of capital against the overall characteristics, the stickiness of it, and then the provision of future services using that same fiber.","From a backlog standpoint of small cells, they had about 2,000 small cells in the pipeline. It has not been a core portion of their business, although they have provided small cells in the past. Most of the carrier revenues that I spoke to, a big portion of that would be related to fiber to the cell. As we've talked about the architecture of the networks, historically, we believe that fiber to the cell becomes very important as hub sites are developed and small cells are developed in conjunction with the existing macro network. So again, another good indication of what we think is going to be upside from small cells. ","And then lastly, your question around the three markets that I spoke to, which are the three largest markets that we've deployed small cells in thus far: Philadelphia, New York and L.A. The 11% return that we have on a recurring yield basis against the net capital invested, consider that a big chunk of that capital put in with the NextG acquisition that we acquired in the neighborhood of about a 2% to 3% yield on invested capital, and then the Sunesys acquisition would have been somewhere in the neighborhood of about a 6% to 7% yield on invested capital.","So virtually all of the NextG initial yields would have been small cells along with virtually all of the growth to bring that capital up to an average of 11%, in Sunesys' case, it would have started at about 6% to 7%, and virtually all of the change since then would've been small cells. And then the capital that we put in on an organic basis would've been all done on small cells.","So the vast majority of the growth and then the blend would've been coming from small cells. My best guess, although, I don't have the numbers sitting right here in front of me, would be in excess of two thirds of that return, total revenues would have been coming from small cells.","David Barden","Thanks Jay.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Operator","And we'll go next to Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Niknam","Hey guys. Thank you for taking the question. Again, congrats on the deal. Just two if I could. First, on the Lightower acquisition, just trying to figure out how the deal may or may not help you. As you had sort of laid out in the past, a 25,000 small cell build pipeline, expected capital outlay of about $1.2 billion in upcoming quarters. So trying to figure out how the deal may help you towards that goal.","And then secondly, on the macro site business, just trying to figure out as we're now halfway through the year, what's been, I guess, better or maybe slower than expected in terms of carrier pacing of activity and just trying to figure out whether some of the better performance year-to-date in the services business maybe a precursor to maybe a little bit more of a lift in that business on the macro site side in 2018? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Matt, on your first question, there will be some benefit from the acquisition that we did in terms of reducing the amount of capital that we would spend on the notes that we referenced last quarter that were the recently contracted notes during the first quarter of 2017. But I would encourage you more to think about this as increasing the size of the pie. As we look at the data and the systems that we have built, we have found the returns to be incredibly compelling. And as we think about the way for us to create shareholder value over time, there have been three tenets of our story that we have consistently come back to.","One is to add additional revenue to the assets that we already own, two has been to lower our overall cost of capital and three has been to allocate capital to things that we think will grow our dividend over time. And as we have learned and studied and watched the investments that we have made, we have seen the investments we have made around fiber and small cells to deliver very compelling returns, and we're in the very early innings of carriers adopting and using small cells.","So as we look for opportunities to continue to deploy capital around this, our intention is to grow the size of the pie because we find the returns to be so compelling. So while we will, I guess, at some level get the benefit of reducing the capital costs in these Northeast markets from the nodes that we already have, which would have \u2013 some portion of those would have been embedded in that $1.2 billion, the reality is we're talking about expanding the pie and looking to put more capital to work because the returns are so compelling. And over time, we believe that will provide additional value to the shareholders in the form of increasing our dividend and our dividend growth rate.","Daniel Schlanger","Yes. And Matt, it's Dan. I'll take the second question. I wouldn't necessarily say that the outperformance in services would be that \u2013 what would show that the activity levels are growing, but I would agree and like we said before, the leasing activity in that could be we are seeing on our tower business is better in 2017 than it was in 2016.","And what we think that will lead to is just given the timing of everything, it won't really impact 2017, as I said in my remarks, but I do think that the deployment of that spectrum that we see is the increased leasing activity now plus the deployment of other spectrum, including FirstNet that will come, should lead to increasing activity and increasing leasing revenues in 2018.","Matthew Niknam","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thank you very much. I think in the past, when you talked about other small cell fiber acquisitions, you talked about not wanting to necessarily play big in the enterprise fiber side of things. Obviously, this deal is on a different scale. So you just talk about how you got comfortable with that? And perhaps just how organizational you're managing it?","I think you did suggest that maybe some of the skills and the talent that you have at Lightower could help drive some enterprise business in some of your existing fiber assets. And then there's been a lot in the press around zoning and infrastructure and trying to really help other carriers and you deploy small cells more efficiently. So what's your latest thoughts on that regulatory landscape and how your success is naturally working through this backlog city by city? Thank you.","Jay Brown","Sure. Thanks for the questions. On the enterprise business, as I spoke to, I think what we have seen in the other acquisitions that we've done is focus on using fiber as a \u2013 what we often like to refer to as a dumb pipe, where really all that is being provisioned is a pipe between two or multi-locations for customers. These are typically done for large enterprises, hospitals, financial institutions, some educational institutions. We find that business to be as passive as we are in the tower business. So sometimes, it's referred to as virtual dark fiber or dim-lit fiber.","That in our view is not a service business. And obviously, as I spoke to earlier around what qualifies for good REIT income, it's really just the provision of a real estate to real estate asset. The smaller acquisitions that we've done over time in other parts of the country have gotten us comfortable with portions of that enterprise business. So as we underwrote the Lightower acquisition, we're obviously assuming that we're going to continue to be in that business, continue to operate the business and grow the business over time. We find there to be very attractive returns on invested capital and believe we can continue to grow the business.","As we thought about the underwriting and whether or not it justified the investment that we're making, this really goes to the heart of the shared economic model. So we're buying the asset in the neighborhood of about a 6% to 7% return on invested capital and able to provision it to the wireless carriers for the deployment of small cells, and it's a means by which we can do the same thing that we've done for a very long period of time with towers, and that has provided the lowest-cost alternatives to the carriers as they deploy their wireless network.","Our goal is to use our cost of capital and to invest the capital in a way that provisions these assets in a way that minimizes the overall cost as the carriers deploy their network. And I believe that's why we have been so successful in attracting small cells on the fiber that we already own because it is the lowest-cost alternative.","If you go back and think about how the tower model has developed over time, in the early days of towers, we acquired towers in the top \u2013 as I spoke to around fiber, we acquired towers in the top 10, top 25 markets at an initial yield of about 3% back in 1999 and 2000 and over time have leased those assets up as densification has occurred in the wireless networks.","In this case, there is an existing source of revenues and cash flow on this fiber that we believe will continue to be there over a long period of time. And on top of that, we believe we will add additional revenues from the wireless carriers to really maximize the ultimate return on the asset. So the way that we've thought about it and continue to approach it has been through our wireless view. And then as we've gotten smarter about what's the quality of the cash flows there, it's enabled us to be able to invest in assets like Lightower because of what we think it will ultimately mean from a return standpoint.","On your second question around small cell regulatory efforts, we have a number of efforts going on at the federal, state and the local level. Like towers, I would tell you, it will forever be hard, we believe, to deploy small cells and fiber. And what we're trying to ensure is that it's a fair deployment and that both we and our carrier customers are treated equal to others who access the right of way. That regulation has been progressing well, and it's helped us in some markets. But as we look at it, we certainly don't expect that it's ever going to be easy.","And I think the story that folks have read about in the press, in the municipalities and at the state level, there's going to continue to be challenges as we balance the desire of people and communities to limit the amount of infrastructure in their communities and the need for the carriers to deploy the infrastructure in order for us as consumers to achieve the kind of services that we really want to use. So it's a balancing act, and we're continuing to work hard at it.","I will tell you, the benefit of scale is significant in this front. Historically, on the tower side, most of the conversations that happened as we would construct or build a tower add an additional tenant to a tower. That was largely a conversation that happened at a homeowners association in most cases. This is a conversation that happens at a citywide basis that reaches town councils and mayors' offices, et cetera. And so the amount of scale and effort we have to do in order to deploy small cells is a much more robust effort in order to do it.","And I believe that scale is helpful to us as we approach and deliver for the carriers because the capabilities to do so are very different than what has historically happened in the tower side where one individual could basically go out and develop a tower in a good location. The regulations and the challenges of deploying small cells really speak to the value of being able to provide it in scale. I think that's reflected in our ability to attract the number of small cell orders that we have so far in calendar year 2017.","Simon Flannery","Thanks Jay.","Operator","And we'll go next to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks very much. A couple of questions if I may. In thinking about the longer-term business mix, I think in the past, you had suggested that potentially we could get to a 50-50 split between the small cell business and the macro side. Is that sort of a target that you're gearing the business towards? And given that scope, I mean, what is the appetite for additional fiber deals?","Jay Brown","Amir, I do believe that ultimately our small cell business could be as big as towers. That is driven primarily though by my view that the carriers are going to invest over a long period of time around their macro sites to densify their network. So I think we'll have two businesses growing, both the component of towers, which, as Dan spoke to, we've continued to see terrific demand for and increased demand in calendar year 2017 over what we saw in 2015 and 2016. So I think you'll see the carriers continue to invest in towers and then also make significant investments around small cells.","Our appetite for additional investment in fiber, I think I'd say a couple of things on that front. One is, this is a large acquisition that's going to take us some time to digest. So we were out looking for the absolute best asset that we could. This does doubles our fiber footprint. It more than doubles the investment that we have placed to-date in fiber, and it's going to take us a little bit of time to digest the acquisition in terms of both integration and getting it up and running as we put small cells against it. So we may need a little bit of time as we digest.","Broadly, though, the returns that we're seeing in this business, as I spoke to in one of my prior comments, is the investments that we're making today, we're making them not because we're trying to grow scale in the business, but because we think it provides value and return to our shareholders over time. And we believe our dividend five years, 10 years from now will be higher as a result of the acquisition that we're making today with Lightower than if we hadn't done it.","And to the extent in the future we see opportunities that meet that test around the strategy that we've articulated, we'll absolutely be open to those. But they will come down to a test against whether or not we believe ultimately we'll be able to return that cash to shareholders at a higher rate than we otherwise would have.","Daniel Schlanger","And Amir, I'll just jump in there. I think we've been consistent as we talk about the fiber asset acquisitions that we've done, that what we're looking for is, as Jay pointed out earlier, deep, dense metro fiber that has opportunities for lots of small cells. And Lightower fits that bill very well, but if you look at the things that, that leaves out, we're not really interested in long haul fiber. We're not interested in fiber that doesn't have a lot of capacity.","We're not interested in fiber outside of metro markets because what we have is the idea that we want to deploy small cells. And Lightower came, like Jay had mentioned, with that opportunity. And we would stick to that even after this digestion period, so we may take a little while here, but I don't think we're going to depart from that desire going forward.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks very much. And then just one follow-up if I may. There's been a lot of discussions about carriers' strategy in densifying their networks. If we think about this, clearly, you folks are seeing pretty healthy appetite in terms of overall demand and co-location activities. We're also hearing about SILEC carriers choosing to build their own activity level or their own [fiber] here. Could you quantify sort of how you see the opportunity set through those two types of strategies?","Jay Brown","Sure. Amir, I think you're going to continue to see both. The carriers are going to self-perform some portion of their small cells. We believe we'll see other infrastructure providers outperform small cells for the carriers. We're certainly not underwriting this asset or any of the investments that we made, assuming that we're going to capture 100% of all future small cells that are deployed.","So I think you'll see the carriers make comments around self-performing. I think those comments really are supportive of what is the opportunity around small cells and the necessity and essential nature of fiber to the deployment of wireless networks. But we also believe that the shared economic model is the lowest cost available to the wireless carriers. And we believe we have done \u2013 as well as we have done with small cells in the early innings of the deployment of small cells because it is the lowest cost provider.","So the shared economic model in the same way that it's the lowest cost provisioning of infrastructure from a tower standpoint, we believe the same thing is true from fiber and small cell. So we believe that over time, we'll see a significant portion of the deployment of small cells on shared infrastructure in places where we think it will be shared and maybe other places where the carriers decide to self-perform because maybe there isn't a shared opportunity.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks very much for taking up the call.","Operator","We'll move next to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick","Hey guys, thanks. Can you first talk about what percent of those 25,000 contracted sites are in markets where Lightower helps you? So is this sort of a build versus buy decision on those markets?","Jay Brown","Yes, so a couple things there. There is \u2013 in some of those notes that we had under contract, we will be helped to some degree. But as I mentioned earlier, this was about the pie just got a lot larger this morning. And so you probably won't be able to find the CapEx savings or a reduction in capital somewhere. It will help on some incremental basis, but really what's happening is we've availed ourselves of the opportunity of capturing even more small cells and the growth from revenue and cash flows associated with this fiber plan.","Daniel Schlanger","And we are hearing from our carrier \u2013 just to jump in, Phil, sorry. We are hearing from the carrier customers that these markets are markets that are important for their small cell deployment. So it's not only what we already have in the pipeline. But as Jay said, how do we increase the size of the pie, and this really helps with that portion of it.","Philip Cusick","Okay. And then second, can you talk about any sort of update on what you're hearing on FirstNet and the process there? Thanks.","Jay Brown","You bet. So FirstNet, I believe at this point, five states have opted into FirstNet. FirstNet had a \u2013 has a requirement to submit a plan to each of the states by September 30 of this year. States then have the option to opt in or opt out by December 31 at the end of this year, calendar year 2017. And as I mentioned, I don't know if anybody announced this morning, we've been a little focused on our Lightower acquisition and earnings, but I believe that as of yesterday, there were five states that had opted in.","Philip Cusick","Yes.","Jay Brown","If states choose to opt out, they have about six months to decide what their plan would be. So that's the basic lay of the land. From a geographic coverage standpoint, they have 12 \u2013 FirstNet has 12 months to demonstrate 20% geographic coverage, then they have to be at about 60% by 24 months and 80% by 36 months out. And then by month 48, I think they have to cover nearly 100% of the geography. So the opportunity here from a tower standpoint, we think is really significant as we go into calendar year 2018 and beyond. And whether the states are opting in or opting out, we think there'll be a meaningful amount of deployment for first responders.","Philip Cusick","I recognize you can't tell us anything about any MLA that might be coming, but can you tell us if AT&T didn't sign an MLA for those opt-in states and wanted to get moving now, is it fairly defined what the pricing would be for them to add a separate spectrum like FirstNet or is that a complicated discussion?","Jay Brown","I don't want to get into any particular customer relationships or how we price. What I would tell you is if \u2013 whether a state was an opt-in or an opt-out state, those state \u2013 the deployment of that spectrum would require either an amendment or a new lease, depending on the nature of it on our sites. And we would expect in the first phase of the deployment of this, this will happen largely around macro sites. And depending on what ultimately the state decides to do, that could be a new lease on a site or an amendment to an existing site. But we do believe that in all cases, there will be additional revenue as a result of the deployment of the spectrum to provide the network for first responders.","Philip Cusick","Understood, thanks Jay.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Operator","We'll go next to Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael","Hi, great. Thank you. Two questions if I may, first on Lightower. When we've seen other fiber like deals like this done, there's typically been a notable amount of cost synergies that have come out of these deals at least in our experience, somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 20% of the OpEx of the target company.","And when I look at your disclosures, you guys haven't really talked about any cost synergies, and I'm wondering if there are any embedded in the 2018 EBITDA assumption and what that could potentially look like one or two years out from now meaning, could we see a notable step up in Lightower related EBITDA in 2019 as you kind of get through those?","The second question is on the small cells. You've talked now for the last few months about this 25,000 node backlog, and it doesn't seem like there was any incremental signings at least notable or material amount of signings in the second quarter. I'm wondering if that's true.","And if it is, do you think that we've signed some of the bigger deals that are out there and now we're going to go through some form of lull, maybe takes us through the rest of 2017 before we could potentially see another step up in meaningful signings and increase in that backlog? Thank you.","Jay Brown","Yes, on the first question, we did not assume any cost synergies in the acquisition or in our underwrite model. We're not going to cut our way to growth. So our intention is to continue to grow the business and we're not assuming there aren't going to be any cost synergies there. We may around the edges, find some savings, but that was not how we underwrote the asset.","Colby Synesael","Does that mean that you don't think that there's going to be any or you're just not assuming them in your own underwriting targets?","Jay Brown","I think, Colby, as we thought about the asset again, we thought about the growth of the asset and the quality of the platform there and the folks who are running that asset. And so our intention is to continue to grow and expand the opportunity. We may find there are some back office synergies maybe around cost of licenses or other things, but that certainly was not the intention.","And we'll be smart operators of the business over time. And I think you can look at our tower business and see a business in terms of the number of assets where it's a stable number of assets and we've been very disciplined around the cost structure there, so to the extent that there are opportunities. We'll avail ourselves of those as any good manager would. But it was not our intention nor in our underwrite model around cost synergies. So I wouldn't expect that we'll see steps from \u2013 as a result of reduction of cost.","On your second question, the reference we're making for the 25,000 is a reference back to what we reconciled everybody through in great detail around our pipeline at the end of the first quarter. Our pipeline actually grew during the second quarter. Given the amount of content and discussions we're having this morning, we didn't go into great detail around the way the pipeline grew, what happened to it.","But the number of sites that we turned operational against the number of bookings actually increased the size of that pipeline. So I wouldn't expect that you will see a lull in the new bookings and new contracted nodes as we put against \u2013 as we built to operate and put on air the nodes that we did.","The one thing I would mention and I think we talked about this pretty extensively in the first quarter. It was not normal growth that we saw towards the end of 2016 and into the first quarter of 2017. We saw that as a big stair step in the level of activity. So it's continuing to grow, but I certainly wouldn't want to imply. We saw another stair step like what we saw in the first quarter, but it did grow relative to the number of nodes that we put on air.","Colby Synesael","Do you plan on updating that 50,000 small cell node number that you provided in the press release last night on a quarterly basis? And if so, should we expect that number then to gradually move up in the back half of this year?","Jay Brown","I think we'll talk directionally about what's in the process and where we think the growth rates are because it's related to where our revenue expectations are. But we like to spend our time talking about what the impact is ultimately to our dividend and what the impact is to the growth rate there.","So we're more likely to probably transition that conversation back to our historical approach of talking about revenue growth translated to cash flow growth translated to dividend growth and have a more wholesome conversation where we're balanced around the cost of the capital that we put into these systems and the cash flow return against those and then what that implies for dividend growth. I would imagine directionally though, we'll continue to talk about activity levels as we have historically and what we're seeing both on the tower side and then also on the small cell side.","Colby Synesael","Okay, thank you very much.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Operator","We'll move next to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","Thanks. Just a couple of questions, in the past you've typically targeted about a 75% AFFO payout for setting your dividend. I'm curious whether you expect the board to maintain that policy going forward and in particular, whether that was the assumption that was standing behind your dividend accretion guidance you provided. And as an extension of that, I'm just curious whether there's any notable difference in the way you derive your AFFO forecasts for Lightower relative to your existing business, particularly around CapEx?","And then just the last question, as you talk about maintaining investment grade profile as you finance the deal, are you still maintaining the same absolute targeted leverage that you've had in the past pro forma for the deal, which has typically been, I think between five and six turns? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Sure. On the first question, yes, we have historically paid out about 75% of our AFFO in the form of a dividend, and that was our working assumption as we laid out this transaction and calculated the $0.15 to $0.20 of expected increase in the dividend related to Lightower. There are no notable differences in our calculation of AFFO or AFFO per share relative to the way we've handled it historically.","Brett Feldman","And on leverage?","Daniel Schlanger","The leverage point Brett, yes like we said in the press release, we want to maintain our investment grade credit metrics. That's what's driving our thought process around how we're going to finance this deal and we are committed to doing so.","Brett Feldman","And you're comfortable that your historical targeted leverage is still something that would qualify as investment grade as the business mix changes?","Daniel Schlanger","We're going to be working with the agencies, and we'll work through it. But we're committed to maintaining the investment grade credit ratings.","Brett Feldman","Okay, thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","We'll move next to Matthew Heinz with Stifel.","Matthew Heinz","Thank you. Good morning. So just first question around the small cell backlog and once again trying to reconcile how we get to the 50,000 pro forma nodes, does that number include the entire 25,000 backlog that you laid out last quarter or is that inclusive of \u2013 I don't know on air?","Daniel Schlanger","Yes, it includes both what is on air and that in full 25,000 node pipeline.","Matthew Heinz","Okay. So about 5,000 incremental growth in the pipeline is how we should think about related number?","Daniel Schlanger","Well, like Jay mentioned, there's a couple thousand from Lightower. And then there \u2013 it wasn't exactly 20,000 and 25,000, and so everything rounded together to approximately 50,000.","Matthew Heinz","Okay. And so you kind of addressed the deal synergies with Colby's question, but I'm wondering if \u2013 to what degree does the Lightower guidance include any incremental lease-up on the assets or is that just an assumption around Lightower's sort of organic business?","Jay Brown","When you look at their business, and we talk about small cells, as we've discussed, typically, there's about an 18-month to 24-month cycle from when we receive a small cell order to when we have it on air. So we're not assuming that we're bringing our small cell expertise to those assets in a way that would result in first year of ownership additional revenues from small cells.","Obviously, we're going to continue to run that business, and they have a pipeline of revenues that we would continue to turn on air and get the cash flow benefit from. But the real revenue synergies, if you want to call it that and the upside from small cells and growth over time, that will be outside of the first year of ownership and really minimal impact in the first 12 months. So that's a longer-term benefit that we'll see and speaks to our comments around our expectation, we'll be able to increase our long-term growth rate by 100 basis points.","Matthew Heinz","Okay, thanks. And then secondly on the tower side, given the acceleration in bookings that you've seen year-to-date, I'm just wondering what the book-to-bill looks like on that activity and how we should think about the cadence of new leasing revenue showing up in first half 2018 versus maybe the latter part of the year?","Daniel Schlanger","Yes, Matt, I don't think we're going to get into giving 2018 guidance right now. We'll do that when we announce our third quarter earnings. But like I said before, we're pretty excited about the level of leasing activity and the acceleration we've seen in 2017. We do think that it will hit in 2018 and it'll show up in our guidance, but it's not something that we're going to get into now at this point.","Jay Brown","Operator, we have time to maybe one more question.","Operator","We'll take our question from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin","Thanks. So looking at the asset over a few slides, Slide 9, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more perspective on the business mix of lit services versus dark fiber also in the context of REIT qualified income? Thanks.","Daniel Schlanger","Yes, the dark fiber is in the neighborhood of about one-third of the overall business mix in Lightower. But as Jay said, when \u2013 the distinction between dark and lit gets a little fuzzy because the lit can run a gamut, and what we're looking at within Lightower is that 80% to 85% of it is really on that infrastructure side and not on the service side. So even though only one-third of its dark, what we look at is really how much of it's \u2013 that passive \"dumb pipe\" infrastructure and that's the 80% to 85% that we think qualifies for our REIT inclusion.","Jonathan Atkin","Is the contract length notably different between those two lines of business, then?","Daniel Schlanger","Well, the average contract length like we said is four years. So what we see is a very attractive contract profile that we're acquiring, and we think that that's sustainable over time. One of the things that attracted us to this business was, as Jay pointed out, when we've been acquiring fiber assets that included fiber solutions businesses, we had a view of wanting to be in this infrastructure portion of the business, and that's exactly how the Lightower team has thought about it and managed the business over time.","So we don't have a huge shift that we would have to make in that. In fact, we can use what they've done and export it to where our fiber sits, and we think that it will be very complementary that way. So we're just excited that the fit works so well for us.","Jonathan Atkin","Thanks very much.","Jay Brown","You bet.","End of Q&A","Jay Brown","Well, thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Obviously, as you've heard from our commentary, we believe that Lightower is a great acquisition that we think it\u2019s going to generate significant value for our shareholders and positions us really well to serve customers by expanding our portfolio in some of the best markets in America. So I appreciate you joining this morning and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And again, that does conclude our call today. Thank you for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded.","And I'd now like to turn the conference over to Son Nguyen. Please go ahead, sir.","Son Nguyen","Thank you, Vicki, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our second quarter 2014 results. With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.","To aid this discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors section of the company's SEC filings. Our statements are made as of today, July 24, 2014, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","In addition, today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciling -- such non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay A. Brown","Thanks, Son, and good morning, everyone. We had another great quarter in Q2 2014 exceeding the high end of our previously issued outlook for site rental revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. The excellent results achieved during the second quarter allow us to increase our outlook for full year 2014. During the quarter, we also made significant progress integrating the AT&T towers, and we expect to substantially complete integration by the fall of this year.","Turning to Slide 3. In the second quarter, site rental revenue grew 21% year-over-year from $617 million to $746 million. Organic Site Rental Revenue before nonrenewals increased by $50 million, an increase of approximately 9% compared to the same period in 2013. The approximately 9% Organic Site Rental Revenue growth is comprised of approximately 4% growth from cash escalations in our customer lease contracts and approximately 5% growth from new leasing activity.","As a part of the new leasing activity, we are continuing to see very strong demand for our small cell networks. At the end of the second quarter, we had nearly 13,000 small cell nodes on air or under construction and over 6,000 miles of fiber. In addition, we have executed contracts for over 3,500 new small cell nodes to build and we are at various stages of preconstruction work, including design and permitting.","Site rental revenue from our cell -- small cell networks is up approximately 26% year-over-year, and small cells generated 6% of consolidated site rental revenues. For the quarter, nonrenewal of tenant leases reaching their contractual term end date, inclusive of Sprint's iDEN decommissioning, was in line with our expectations of approximately 2% of site rental revenue.","As shown on Slide 4, site rental gross margin increased $72 million to $509 million, up 16% from the second quarter of 2013. In Q2, our site rental operating expenses of $237 million came in higher than our previously provided Q2 outlook range by $2 million. Excluding a noncash purchase accounting adjustment related to our acquisition of AT&T towers, our site rental operating expenses would have been within our guidance range. This noncash item doesn't impact adjusted EBITDA or AFFO. For the full year 2014, this noncash item results in an increase to site rental operating expenses of approximately $3 million and is reflected in our revised outlook.","Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 increased 19% from the same quarter in 2013. This growth is attributable to the increase in site rental gross margin, inclusive of the AT&T towers, and the strong performance from network services and offset to a small degree by increased G&A. Compared to the same quarter last year, site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin percentages were negatively impacted by the AT&T tower transaction, which have an average tenancy of 1.7 tenants and, therefore, lower margins when compared to our legacy assets with approximately 3 tenants per tower. In addition, site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA were impacted by the investment we have made in our people, processes and assets over the last several quarters, which shows up in our increased run rate of site rental and network services operating expenses, as well as G&A. This increase in cost is being made to accommodate the high level of leasing activity we are experiencing on both towers and small cells. I would also note that the increase in contribution from network services alone far exceeds the totality of the increase in run rate costs. The increase in costs to manage an expanded portfolio is consistent with our past practice and our strategy to provide the highest level of customer service in the industry.","To provide some context, in 2007 when we closed the Global Signal acquisition of approximately 11,000 towers, site rental gross margin postacquisition was 64% compared to 70% prior to the acquisition. In a period of 2 years, margins returned to 70%, reaching 75% within 4 years. The investment we made in additional staffing during that time frame positioned us to meaningfully grow our business, as site rental revenues increased from $1.3 billion in 2007 to $1.9 billion over the same 4-year period.","In the absence of additional acquisitions, we expect to see our site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin percentages expand as carriers add equipment to our sites, reflecting the high operating leverage of our business and increasing the yield on our assets.","AFFO for the second quarter was $351 million compared to $273 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of 28%. On a per-share basis, AFFO was up 13% increasing from $0.93 per share to $1.05 per share.","Moving on to investments and financing activities as shown on Slide 5. During the quarter, we closed on an 8-year, $850 million senior notes offering with a coupon of 4.875%. Proceeds from the offering were used to refinance $800 million of existing debt that had a weighted average coupon of approximately 6%. Today, our weighted average cost of debt stands at 4.2% with a weighted average maturity of 6 years. Our total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA is 5.3x, and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense is 4.3x. We expect to continue to delever through growth and adjusted EBITDA with the goal of reducing debt to adjusted EBITDA below 5x, which we believe should position us for an investment grade credit rating.","During the second quarter, we invested $167 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $25 million on our land lease purchase program. During the quarter, we extended 389 land leases on our sites by an average of approximately 26 years. This extension activity impacted consolidated recurring cash ground lease expense by approximately 10 basis points. Additionally, we purchased land beneath 125 of our towers during the quarter. Today approximately 1\/3 of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own, and approximately 70% on land we own or lease for more than 20 years. Where we have ground leases, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 29 years. Since we began this important effort, we have completed over 16,000 individual land transactions. Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business as we look to control our largest operating expense.","Of the remaining capital expenditures, we invested $129 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures consisting of $96 million on existing sites and $33 million on the construction of new sites, primarily small cell construction activity. We also spent approximately $13 million on sustaining CapEx, which was below our second quarter 2014 outlook. However, we've not adjusted our full year outlook for sustaining capital expenditures as we expect to perform the same sustaining CapEx activities within 2014, completing this expected work during the second half of the year. Further during the quarter, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.35 per share or $117 million in aggregate.","On Slide 6, I'd like to spend a minute to discuss the sequential impact to the third quarter of 2014 as it relates to adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Our Q3 2014 outlook for adjusted EBITDA assumes that network services margin contribution to be similar to Q2 2014, which is meaningfully higher than our previous outlook for second half of 2014. And consistent with my prior comments regarding our investment in people, processes and assets, we expect to incur higher G&A expenses in Q3 2014 as compared to Q2 2014. In addition to the flow-through impact from adjusted EBITDA, our Q3 2014 outlook for AFFO also reflects higher anticipated sustaining capital expenditures as compared to Q2, related to the buildout of additional office space and for the timing reason I previously mentioned.","Turning to 2014 outlook on Slide 7. Based on our second quarter results and taking into account the change in our exchange rate assumption for Australia, we have increased full year 2014 outlook for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by $7 million, $34 million and $30 million, respectively, at the midpoint.","As shown on Slide 8, the midpoint of our 2014 outlook for site rental revenues implies growth of 20% on an as-reported basis or approximately $491 million compared to full year 2013. On an organic basis before nonrenewals, our 2014 outlook implies revenue growth of approximately 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. This 9% is comprised of approximately 5% from new leasing activity and approximately 4% from escalations on existing customer lease contracts.","Further, based on Sprint's stated intention to decommission their iDEN network and our contractual terms with Sprint, we expect approximately 3% of our run rate site rental revenues to be impacted by the iDEN network decommissioning. These iDEN leases have effective term end dates spread throughout 2014 and 2015. As such, we expect our site rental revenues to be impacted by approximately $30 million in 2014 and $60 million to $70 million in 2015. On an organic basis, net of nonrenewals, our 2014 outlook implies revenue growth of approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint.","Our increased 2014 outlook for adjusted EBITDA implies 17% growth year-over-year, reflecting higher expected contribution from network services, as well as our acquisition of the AT&T towers.","Our team continues to do an outstanding job in executing for our customers. While much of the growth in network services can be attributed to the increase in our asset portfolio over the last several years, our team has captured more of the services opportunities related to our towers by working closely with our carrier customers. With the demand for wireless infrastructure expected to continue, we believe that the contribution from network services should be sustainable for some time.","Moving on to AFFO on Slide 9, our increased outlook for full year 2014 reflects the increase in our outlook for adjusted EBITDA, offset somewhat by higher sustaining capital expenditures. At the midpoint, AFFO of $1.38 billion for 2014 implies per share growth of 13% over full year 2013. Based on our 2014 outlook, we expect to generate approximately $1.6 billion between AFFO and net prepaid rent. Approximately 30% of this $1.6 billion is allocated to dividends; another 40% is allocated to planned but not -- but discretionary capital expenditures, such as land purchases, construction of towers and small cells and other capital expenditures associated with additional leasing activity; the remaining 30% is available to pursue share purchases and acquisitions, in addition to increasing the amount we plan to spend on revenue-generating capital expenditures.","As we've discussed previously, over the next 5 years, we expect to increase our dividend per share by at least 15% annually. We currently have a net operating loss balance, or NOL, of approximately $2 billion, which we would expect to utilize prior to 2020. We expect that once the NOLs are exhausted, our dividend payout as a percentage of AFFO will increase from the approximately 30% today to something in the area of 70% to 80%, which implies a compound annual growth rate of our dividend in excess of 20% over this period of time. Currently, we are utilizing the flexibility afforded by the NOLs to make accretive, long-term discretionary investments. These discretionary investments may include acquisitions; the construction of new sites, including small cell networks; land purchases; and the purchase of our own securities. When considering these investments, we evaluate each opportunity based on our goal of maximizing our long-term dividends and AFFO per share. This strategy is not new. Over a very long period of time, our approach to capital allocation combined with strong execution has driven significant growth in AFFO per share.","So in summary, we had a great second quarter, and I believe that our capital allocation strategy will enhance our long-term growth of AFFO per share and dividends.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Thanks, Jay and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning. As Jay just discussed, the second quarter was another excellent quarter, positioning us once again to raise our full year outlook.","As shown on Slide 10, we are continuing our track record of consistent execution over a long period of time. Through strong execution and disciplined capital allocation, we have delivered strong AFFO per share growth, growing AFFO per share at a compound annual growth rate of 17% since 2007. Importantly, this growth transcended the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, and continues today while we have taken decisive steps to position ourselves as the U.S. market leader with unmatched scale and capabilities. Today, we have new opportunities in small cells and tower leasing unforeseen just a few years ago. And we created this future runway of growth without materially altering the risk profile of the company.","For the full year of 2014, our midpoint of our outlook suggests AFFO per share growth of 13% compared to 2013, plus the dividends we initiated this year. We are committed to extending this track record of growth over the long term, and we believe that the growth in AFFO per share and dividends will deliver attractive long-term total shareholder returns. Quite frankly, the degree to which we accomplish this goal over the long term is heavily dependent on our ability to increase tenants on the approximately $9 billion in investments we have made over the last few years with the T-Mobile tower and AT&T tower transactions and the NextG small cell acquisition.","In many ways, our approach to capital allocation is a reflection of our corporate strategy; we think long term. We have invested deeply in the U.S. as we believe the U.S. market offers the most compelling risk-adjusted returns. Simply, our goal with capital allocation is to maximize our long-term dividend paying capacity from growth and AFFO per share. We believe that this growth -- this goal dovetails nicely with our recent commencement of operations as a REIT.","Going one step further, in assessing our long-term dividend paying capacity, we take into consideration many aspects, including the quality of our underlying clash flows, our long-term growth potential and the risks associated with our business. When evaluating potential discretionary investments, we seek to maximize AFFO per share relative to comparable investments such as share repurchases. Since 2003, we've invested $2.9 billion in share purchases, buying back over 100 million shares or share equivalents at an average price of approximately $28 per share. As such, we view our investment hurdle rate as the long-term total shareholder return we would expect from purchasing our shares as measured by the growth in dividend and AFFO over that same period of time.","Further, when it comes to various alternative investments, whether they are domestic or international assets or small cells or macro towers, we adjust the comparative returns to take into account any perceived differences in the underlying risk of the investment. Adjustments are made to account for such things as currency and political risks, differences in business fundamentals and available financing sources. For the T-Mobile and AT&T transactions, our investment thesis is that we should be able to replicate the performance of our legacy assets with these newly acquired assets over time.","As shown on Slide 11, we believe the T-Mobile and AT&T tower assets with an average tenancy of 1.6 and 1.7 tenants, respectively, provide an opportunity to enhance our long-term AFFO per share growth by adding tenants.","Tower assets that we've owned and operated for more than 10 years have approximately 3 tenants per tower today, and an excess of $90,000 in revenues per tower and currently yield 15% on total invested capital, representing significant shareholder value creation when compared to the initial yield at the time of purchase of approximately 4% to 5%, similar to the T-Mobile and AT&T transactions. With our history of acquiring and operating carrier portfolios, we believe that these new assets will perform and achieve yields similar to our legacy assets. Further, as Jay stated, we are currently investing in our people, processes and assets to position us over the long term to realize the lease-up potential on these new towers, which have significant available capacity.","These assets are well located, as we've stated before, with a significant concentration in the top 100 markets where the majority of carrier spending occurs. And most importantly, our investments were made based on our view that there will be continued and significant wireless network investment over the next decade to support the services that we have all come to depend on. We believe the case for continuing investment in wireless infrastructure in the U.S. is very compelling for the wireless carriers.","As shown on Slide 12, the U.S. market, with $189 billion in wireless service revenue supporting $34 billion in capital investments on behalf of the carriers, is uniquely attractive due to its relative size and robustness compared to other markets. Increasingly, there is a high correlation between network investment and customer satisfaction, leading carriers to continue to upgrade their wireless networks to improve network quality, increase capacity and add functionality in order to remain competitive and grow. This virtuous cycle was reinforced just this week, as Verizon indicated on their earnings call their continuing commitment to network investment with wireless CapEx, expected to be up significantly year-over-year. They are not alone in this pursuit as Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile are each aggressively investing in LTE upgrades, adding capacity and broadband speed. And our portfolio of sites and capabilities are fully engaged at this point, helping them pursue this endeavor.","Further, as can be seen on Slide 12, there is also a high correlation between unit economics and carrier capital investment. With strong unit economics of $50-plus per subscriber per month or $600 annually, U.S. carriers are able to generate positive incremental returns on their capital investment on a scale that dwarfs other geographies. The relatively high ARPU is supported by the staggering growth in mobile data consumption by U.S. subscribers. In CTIA's latest report, during 2013, mobile data consumption was estimated to have more than doubled when compared to 2012. Moreover, consumers are increasingly becoming more reliant on mobile in their everyday lives. According to CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, at the end of last year, approximately 41% of U.S. households relied solely on wireless phones. CTIA reports that this number jumps to over 55% when including households that have -- that do not rely on wireline services. The average U.S. consumer spends more than 50% of his or her Internet time on mobile devices currently. In fact, according to peer research, 34% of mobile U.S. subscribers use their mobile devices as their primary device to access the Internet. Today, it seems as though almost every aspects of our lives have gone mobile: mobile retail, mobile banking, mobile health and mobile security, streaming entertainment, cloud computing and connected devices are all driving increased network usage. With these new applications and an introduction of the adoption of data-intensive mobile devices, Cisco projects that mobile data traffic, even after accounting for Wi-Fi offloading, will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 50% or an eightfold increase over the next 5 years.","To meet the growing demand by consumers and drive incremental returns as the pie gets larger, we believe U.S. carriers will continue to find it attractive to invest in their networks. And as carriers continue to invest, consumers and businesses have quickly absorbed the network capacity added by the carriers, leading to a reinforcing cycle of investment by the carriers and increased usage by the end consumer. This recurring cycle of investment has led to continuous network improvements, giving us confidence that we will benefit from a long runway of sustained organic revenue growth.","Before wrapping up, I'd like to spend a minute on our small cell activity. More and more, carriers are turning to small cells to address capacity and coverage issues that cannot be solved by macro tower sites alone. As a result, we are seeing activity on the small cells front from all 4 major wireless carriers. As Jay mentioned, year-over-year, site rental revenues from small cells is up 26% with a robust pipeline in front of us. To date, our yield on invested capital for small cells is already in excess of 6%, including the $1 billion investment we made in the NextG acquisition, which was acquired with an initial yield of approximately 4%. Due to the high operating leverage and significant demand we expect that the lease-up for small cells will continue to drive meaningful increases in yield, we believe the runway of opportunities in small cells is very similar to what we saw in towers back in the early 2000s.","As the largest provider of small cells with over 13,000 nodes and over 6,000 miles of fiber feeding them, our scale and expertise position us to capitalize on this growing opportunity and we expect to continue to make investments in this area.","To wrap up, our investments of the last few years have expanded our portfolio to nearly 40,000 towers and over 13,000 nodes, positioning us as the U.S. market leader in shared wireless infrastructure. I am very pleased with the progress we've made on the integration of the AT&T towers, while handling very high levels of activity in the business on all fronts. We are keenly focused on delivering for our carrier customers and extending our track record of growth in AFFO per share for many years to come.","With that, operator, I'd like to turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will first go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ben, nice overview. I wonder if you can square some of the headlines we're hearing about spending freezes at the carriers and other issues out of the equipment providers. You've had strong services businesses. You've got a good outlook for the second half of the year. So what are you actually seeing in the field? Are you seeing any signs of this? Because clearly, there is a little bit of a disconnect that people are trying to get their heads around. And on the services, I think you talked about it being strong into Q3. Can you just give us a little bit of a longer-term outlook? Is this something as we go into '15, you see these levels being maintained as well?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure, Simon. First of all, on the capital spending side with the carriers, we're seeing a lot of activity. And I believe that AT&T addressed this on their call, any slowdown or deferment in the second half of the year that AT&T may be pursuing is completely immaterial to what we're seeing. And we have a tremendous amount of activity going on, frankly, with all 4 wireless carriers. And application volume, if you include new site installations, as well as amendments for us sort of year-to-date are up materially from last year. Now we do have a larger portfolio, I would acknowledge, but we got a lot going on, on that front. And as evidenced by 9% organic revenue growth in our outlook is -- that's moving, and that's a lot of work going on. So we are thrilled with what we see happening on -- by all 4 carriers as they're working on LTE. Your second question around services is one we continue to spend a lot of time on as a management team. Our group out there in the field, and many of them are listening, continue to amaze and are doing a fantastic job of capturing the opportunities and serving our customers in the field and assisting them on getting on our sites. And the scope of that work has increased over time. A lot of it has increased because the size of the portfolio has increased, but we are increasingly becoming confident that there is certainly a run rate of opportunity out there in this business. And we've gone back and looked at it since 2007, 2008 and '09 where we've come to add capability and there's always a lot of stuff going on, on our sites, which is a recurring opportunity for us. So you saw us raise guidance for the second half of the year such that it's going to look a lot like the first half of the year. And as we look out into '15, I'm not going to give you guidance yet on '15, but we're pretty confident that, that level of activity is going to be there for quite some time.","Operator","Next is David Barden with Bank of America.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I think that the confusion a little bit around the quarter and looking at the third quarter outlook, Jay, is just trying to square the 9% organic revenue growth with site rental gross margin guidance that suggests we might have another sequential downtick in the business. So -- and obviously, the implied full year guidance says we're going to tick back up in the fourth quarter. But if you could kind of help us waterfall the moving parts so we can see what's growing in the business and then where the headwinds are in more granular form down to the site rental gross margin level, that would be super helpful. And then, I guess, the second question I would have is relative to the full year 2014 AFFO of 13% growth outlook. How much of that year-over-year is coming from the AT&T portfolio acquisition?","Jay A. Brown","Sure, on your first question. The movements quarter-to-quarter and the way we move the outlook, I think, for the balance of the year, we're certainly benefiting in terms of the outlook from FX and we raised -- slightly raised our expectation for FX based on actual levels that we saw during the second quarter. So that's the majority of the reason why we raised site rental revenue. The flow through of that, I made several comments, which are really driving that, too. One is that we had a purchased -- a noncash purchase adjustment related to our AT&T acquisition. That flows through those site rental gross margin numbers. Once we get down to EBITDA, we adjust that noncash item out, both at an adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. So that's a part of the consideration. And then the second part of the consideration, which wasn't -- was planned when we did the acquisition, is we're staffing up -- my comments around staffing and increase in people, those were anticipated both in our outlook, as well as in our underwriting model for the AT&T towers. And I think for the most part, we've gotten those costs in, or we'll have them in by the third quarter. So I think you correctly point out, the squeeze to the fourth quarter would suggest that there is movement upward in site rental gross margin. And so once we get all the costs into the run rate, which I think we'll have mostly done by the third quarter, you'll start to see those upward trends that we're used to. On the 13%, we bought the AT&T assets at basically a 5% yield going in. And when you consider our combination of use of debt, as well as stock, the transaction was slightly accretive by a couple of pennies in the calendar year 2014 or on a run-rate basis, if you want to think about it that way. So the contribution at the AFFO per share line would be relatively minimal from the acquisition, almost none. If you look at the nominal numbers in terms of site rental revenue growth and margin EBITDA and the absolute dollars of AFFO, obviously, it contributed meaningfully. But at the per-share line, there's very little impact from the acquisition and the way we financed it.","Operator","And we'll go to Kevin Smithen with Macquarie Capital.","Unknown Analyst","This is Will [ph] for Kevin. If there are no more large deals in the U.S. to do, you're going to have significant excess free cash flow and borrowing capacity in '15. Can you discuss a little more how you think about that capital allocation? And are you now open to deals in Brazil or other emerging markets?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, Will [ph], this is Ben. I'll take a crack at that. We've got a lot going on, as I talked about it in my comments. And I don't think it's a big stretch to see that we may find the ability to spend virtually all of our discretionary free cash flow right here at home around our core business. And in particular, as the pipeline around small cells grows, we're going to put a lot of money to work at very productive rates for carriers that we know and love. So that's really where our primary focus is today. We'll always look at something internationally, but my working assumption today is that we'll be priced out of anything out there. So I'm not assuming that we're going to do anything in Latin America or Brazil, specifically to your question. Just based almost solely on where I've seen assets trade, I don't think we're a player at those levels. So we've got a lot on our plate here going deeper in the U.S. market. As Jay mentioned, we've got 3,500 sites in terms of nodes on the pipeline to be built and that's growing. So we've got a lot to do with our capital right here at home.","Unknown Analyst","And I have one follow-up. Is there any number that you give as kind of the addressable remaining sites that you would potentially purchase in the U.S.?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I wouldn't speculate on that. I mean, we sort of look at things as they come up. And I think one of my sort of threshold comments that I think it's important to repeat -- and we'll always look at acquisitions as we have, obviously, over time. But the real value creation for Crown Castle going forward is around organic growth. And it all goes back to that slide in this deck today where we need to turn 17,000 towers from a 5% yield to a 15% yield over time. And that's the value driver in this business. Acquisitions, obviously become the platform to do that. You have to have the assets to do that. But we have the assets today, and we have our work cut out for us. As so we've got a full plate of value creation opportunities right here.","Operator","And we'll go to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. Ben, you mentioned the 3,500 nodes that are in the pipeline. What kind of cost or CapEx should we be thinking about and timeline to kind of bring those online?","Jay A. Brown","Ric, this is Jay. There's -- the 3,500, I would assume rough math, between $100,000, $120,000 per node to build those out. And typically the timeline from the time of executing the contracts -- and those 3,500, just to be clear in my comments, were all preconstruction phase. So we're in the design and permitting phase of that 3,500. That's probably an 18-month to 30-month timeline to get those on air.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then the 13,000 that you have, did you say some of those are under construction still?","Jay A. Brown","Some of them are at the final stages of construction, correct.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then when you think about capital deployment, stock buyback is there. The stock has underperformed the other 2 public tower guys. So when you look at your multiple where you're trading at and your growth rate, how do you look at deploying small cell versus stock buyback? When does all of a sudden the acquisition of your own stock become more interesting possibly?","Jay A. Brown","Ric, we always do this analysis on a relative basis. So where we see the opportunity and the returns in our share purchases are always compared at that point in time against other opportunities that we have. So in the case of -- specifically to your question, is we would evaluate small cell opportunities and our appetite to invest in small cells. They would be compared up against whatever the then multiple is on our equity and what we think the growth prospects are in our underlying business. And we're -- we constantly update that analysis. And the capital spend is discretionary. So at a point in time where we think the return is higher and -- for project A over project B, then we tend to move the capital around, aiming towards the investment that we think delivers the highest return on AFFO per share as a proxy for ultimately what our dividend capacity is going to be. So it's really a relative measure and we adjust it based on where we see the market opportunities.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Small cell obviously is a very important part of your story, 6% of your business, growing 26% a year. Is there a time where that becomes a segment reported item also, as far as revenue, gross margins, contribution, et cetera?","Jay A. Brown","There may be a day for that. I think as we operate the business today, it falls underneath our site rental leasing business. It all falls under our Chief Operating Officer and we operate the business very similar. It has very similar characteristics to the tower site in terms of the margin, the incremental margins that we see as we add additional tenants. So there may be a day for that. I won't preclude it from ever happening, but I think at the moment, it looks very similar to what towers does.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And one more quick one if I could. A lot of people talking about Sprint Spark, the high-frequency buildouts, T-Mobile low band. Is there anything in your guidance yet for those? Have you seen anything in the services business as a leading indicator from Sprint going to that new phase and T-Mobile going into the new phase?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Specifically with T-Mobile, that's more likely a 2015 event, is what it's looking to us. We're going to get pretty late in the year before we see a lot of that. So the answer to that would be no, until we give you the '15 guidance. With respect to Sprint, we are seeing a tremendous amount of service opportunity from Sprint related to the network vision upgrades and the 2.5 upgrades that you talked about. And it is also coming through to some degree in site rental revenue growth that's implied without being able to be specific. It's certainly implied and contributing to this overall 9% growth for the year.","Operator","And we'll go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So can you talk about services a little bit more? I mean, we've talked about services for a long time and usually you give guidance that, \"Yes, this was a great quarter but we're pretty conservative going forward.\" Now it seems like you have a little bit better visibility. I mean, you talk about Sprint ramping up 2.5. But is there also -- are you moving to longer contracts that give you more real visibility when giving guidance? Is that how we should think about it? And then second, can you help us -- I'm sorry, go ahead, Jay.","W. Benjamin Moreland","No, I'd -- no, this is Ben. Phil, I'd say, not so much longer contracts but a longer track record of success. We're frankly -- our teams are teaching me, really, that this is a business that they are extremely good at and have the capacity to continue to grow. And so maybe it's on my plate to say I have become more confident in our ability to continue to attract and win this business and execute for carriers. And we also look at it -- I think it's helpful to parse through how much of the growth is because of the growth in portfolio versus actually growth in the sort of per-site metrics. And that -- we're up about -- I guess over the last 4 years, up about 50% at a per-site level in terms of penetration. Even though the business is up much larger than that, it's more than doubled over the -- that same period, but a lot of that is because of the growth in the portfolio. So maybe it's an education of the CEO that our guys are really good at this, and this is going to remain a very key component of our story and what we do with carrier customers to provide that high touch experience and control our assets at the end of the day.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And can you give us an idea of how much of your AFFO is coming from the services side?","Jay A. Brown","I think what I would probably suggest that you would do, Phil, if you were going to try to estimate that, is I would take about 40% of the G&A, roughly, probably between 35% and 45% of the G&A, say, 40% of the G&A, and allocate it to the services business. So take your gross -- take our gross margin, if you want to do historical or forward looking, take the gross margin from services and subtract out the G&A and just use that as a contribution. I mean, obviously, if we think about leveraging the business, we would typically think about leveraging the site rental portion of the business, so you may have -- you may want to apply some portion of the debt or maybe not. There would not be any sustaining capital expenditures of any significant amount associated with that. So that's probably the best way to go about it.","Operator","And next up is Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the questions around some of the trajectory of carrier spending here, if I may. Certainly, it looks like, if we look at the CapEx numbers for the carriers that have reported, on a year-over-year basis they look fairly healthy. But clearly, there seems to be a bit of front-end loading with respect to their spending. Wanted to just touch base there because I understand there's various nuances when it comes to the very specific buckets in terms of where they're spending. But it seems as though you folks feel very comfortable in raising your outlook for the year in terms of the spending trajectory that you're seeing. Is that largely coming from densification initiatives that they're spending on? And what gives you that comfort that, that carries forward into 2015?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, Amir, this is Ben. That's a critical question and obviously, the driver -- the main driver in our business and confidence in the future. Without getting into specifically what each carrier is doing because we typically don't do that, we let you speak to them, as you can see from the Verizon call this week and AT&T that they're spending a whole lot of money: AT&T reconfirming their capital budget for the whole year at around $21 billion; Verizon being up significantly year-over-year through the first 6 months. And we're seeing a significant amount of activity from both of those carriers, as well as Sprint and T-Mobile, but they're in different phases. And so this is where we gain a lot of confidence in the runway of growth that we're going to see. So as with -- starting with Verizon and AT&T, we're seeing them complete their -- really, their first sort of initial phase of LTE build and really approaching 300 million covered POPs. And then immediately following on, and we're well into it this year with both of those carriers on adding additional installations, brand-new, macro-site installations, co-los, if you will, which adds densification to their networks. And that is happening in a very material way throughout the country. It is not a stretch, then, to walk down the lines of Sprint and T-Mobile, as they are also working very aggressively on completing their LTE rollout. And we are -- we would expect, then, that to follow on with densification on both of those networks over time as the capacity gets consumed on these LTE networks as is currently happening, and the need for additional sites becomes more and more acute. That is beginning to happen. We're seeing -- we're getting some search rings out of Sprint. We'd certainly expect to see that out of T-Mobile over time. And what we're seeing over -- many of us have been in this industry 15 years plus. We're seeing now a more continuous spend, not so much a cycle anymore, but just sort of a continuous spend level against ever-increasing ARPUs, really driven by data from us as consumers. And the pie is actually getting bigger. As we all find more uses for tablets and smartphones, the pie is getting bigger. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, the incremental return on that incremental dollar of investment is alive and well. And so we sort of see it as sort of a continuous spend as opposed to these sort of fits and starts that we had sort of over the last decade.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then if I may, I'll follow up. You folks are sort of uniquely positioned, particularly when it comes to the exposure on the small cell side. We've had a lot of discussions with the carriers in talking about the value between the macro and the small cell. But I think the general tone at least right now from what we're hearing is that from a macro site perspective, it still provides sort of the best bang for the buck, and continued investment on the macro site is necessary to deliver the types of speeds that they're promising over the next couple of years. Is that something that you folks agree with or -- would love to hear your thoughts on that front.","Jay A. Brown","Absolutely. I agree with that. We own 40,000 towers. It's 94% of our revenue stream, and you\u2019ve got to believe we agree with that. So the macro site is still the most efficient way to add capacity and the most expeditious way to add capacity in a market. What we're seeing on the small cell business, though, is an augmentation or a compliment to that where there's areas where the density of the urban footprint is such that a macro site really won't suffice, and they're needing to reuse that spectrum in a much smaller cell environment. And therefore, we're seeing an additional architecture emerge, as we've talked about for years, and it's emerging in a very big way now around distributed antenna systems or small cell euphemistically. Again, we use those sort of interchangeably. But essentially, small antenna's driven by fiber-fed electronics on light poles and street lamps and other things like that to augment where a macro cell is not sufficient or otherwise they need to reuse the spectrum in a much smaller environment in terms of a much smaller cell. But we absolutely endorse your first view, which is macro sites are the first solution, and that's why we own 40,000 of them.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And if I may, just one last quick question. When we go back to the PCIA trade show last fall and also this past spring, I think one of the themes that emerged was that we're seeing a resurgence in actually new tower builds in the U.S. Clearly off of a base of very minimal incremental tower build, are you folks still experiencing that? Is it -- are you still seeing that in the marketplace?","Jay A. Brown","We're seeing a few opportunities. I will tell you, it goes back to Jay's capital allocation discussion. We'll do them where we think we can make money. It's usually the place where new entrants enter the market at initial yields on the asset that, frankly, we've been uninterested in pursuing. So we may let others build some of those if those economics are not enticing to us. We're going to do some this year. Probably over the next 12 months, I would guess 100 or maybe 150, but not material to really -- to our results.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two questions please. The first is, Ben, I'd love to get a breakdown of sort of the drivers of growth in the quarter. Historically, you've kind of given us some perspective of amendments versus new cell sites, and then what percent of that is falling under the MLA umbrellas that you have? And then my second question has to do with sort of the dividend growth story that Jay laid out, which I think is very compelling. And I was wondering if we might get a little perspective because you talked about the NOL roll off, but maybe we get a little perspective on what's happening with the DNA. By my records, you guys bought 7,000 towers or, I don't know, 17%, 18% of your portfolio in 1998, 1999. And I'm wondering how we might think about the DNA associated with that original sort of portfolio as we look at our projections and also try to understand some of the dividend distribution capabilities.","Jay A. Brown","Sure, on the first question around where we are with leasing, it's very similar to what we expected for the full year. There was about 10% of the activity that we're seeing that's following under the presold MLAs that we negotiated several years ago. So there's very little of the activity that's falling under that -- those presold agreements. In terms of the activity that we're seeing across all of the assets, we're seeing in the neighborhood of about 3\/4 to 80% of the activity coming from new tenant installations, and the balance of it coming from amendments to existing sites. We've seen that activity, I would point out, across all of the carriers and all of the portfolios, including the 2 most recent purchases that we've had, where we're already seeing some amendment activity that's driving site rental revenue growth across the portfolio. So I know we've talked about that some in the past, and that's -- it's coming about in about the same magnitude as we had expected going into the balance of the year. Your question about the net operating losses and the depreciation that we see from a tax standpoint, the tax depreciation is faster on an asset purchase than what it is for the GAAP statement. And so as we have gone through the process and you rolled back all the way to our original acquisitions, and then as you think about the impact to us from the more recent acquisitions, the 2 recent acquisitions that we've done were in the form of prepaid leases. So our payments out from a tax standpoint, those are reflected against the cost to the asset or if you want to think about it as DNA costs. Those are reflected across the term of those leases over 20-plus years. So there's minimal impact to our NOLs as a result of those 2 acquisitions. A simple way of thinking about it is we bought the assets on a 5% yield, which, if the cost is over 20 years, then basically day 1, there's no NOL that's building, and so each dollar of revenue and, therefore, margin that we add, is going to effectively go against our net operating loss and reduce the amount of NOL that we've built over a period of time. So as I look out over the next 5 years, I certainly believe, by 2020, given the pace that we're on with growth, I think we will exhaust that NOL by then. It may be -- depending on how the dynamics work out, it may be a year to 2 years prior to that 2020 date, just depending upon the flow of things like prepaid rent and other things that may affect that net operating loss. But I think for modeling purposes, without getting into much more detail than what I just walked through, I think probably the best way to think about it is us exhausting it somewhere in that 2019, 2020 time frame if the growth rate continues at the current pace. And then if it accelerates our decelerates, we'll kind of update that with you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Imari Love with Morningstar.","Imari Love - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just quickly back on small nodes, you said it was a 6% of site rental rev. Can we get a gauge of how the returns on invested capital compare relative to returns you're seeing on the macro sites? So you mentioned that the macro sites over 10 years, it's around 15%; around 5% on the early end of that. Can you give us a gauge of where small nodes fit on that spectrum?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure, happy to do that. And that's really part of the enthusiasm that we share for that business. As I mentioned, if you think about the original acquisition of size where we spent $1 billion on the NextG acquisition at about a 4% yield, we have borrowed through that to the point today where the entire sort of run rate of business is about a 6% yield on invested capital. So you can then infer that the incremental business we've gotten past the acquisition is substantially above that. As we go forward, our expectation and what we're seeing is that the returns on this business we expect will exceed over 10 years what we've seen in the tower business. And we are obviously very pleased with the results we've posted on the legacy assets, as we talked about in the earlier part of this call. But we're on a trajectory today with small cells and the anticipated co-location that'll happen in these very dense and attractive markets where we're building these systems, that we think we'll frankly exceed by a significant margin what we've accomplished on the tower sites.","Operator","We'll now go to Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of follow-ups. Looking out to your estimates for revenue from existing customers, it looks like you increased your projections for the next 4 years of about 2.5% to 2%. Can you help us reconcile why we didn't see a similar increase in the site rental outlook for 2014, and how we can think about that versus the nonpercent organic growth that you're seeing today? Does that suggest that we should be expecting a similar organic growth for 2015? And the second question I had is, as you go through the expected churn from iDEN, what's your experience with Sprint's renewal activity for these towers? I also noticed that you slightly lowered your expectations for rental revenue from Sprint at time of renewals for future periods. Can you talk about what drove that?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On the first question, you will see those tables over the long period of time, the increases we have leasing. So those tables reflect actual leases under contract, and we're not going to forecast that table for the forecasted growth during the calendar year. So as quarters pass, we would assume that the next 12-month forward or 2 years forward, the revenue numbers in that table will increase commensurate with the growth that we actually achieved during the previous quarter. So that table is not -- it's intended to be forward looking in terms of the contracts that we have on the books today, but we don't adjust those contracts based on our expectation for growth over the subsequent period or multiple periods. With regards to Sprint, some of that is going to be the impact of the leasing they did in the quarter, as well as the decommissionings that actually happened in the quarter, as well as any extensions that we saw on those leases. And those can come from simple things like if they amend a site, and this would be true for all of the carriers. There may be an amendment on a site and they may take out a lease over a longer period of time and it may adjust that table. So in all likelihood, as you're poring into kind of that detail, it's a combination of the leases that happened in the quarter, any nonrenewals that happened in the quarter, as well as there could be extensions most likely related to things like an amendment on an individual site.","Operator","And we'll now go to Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to touch on -- back on Slide 11, I noticed that the yield increase for the T-Mobile and AT&T assets, it looks like you're basically targeting tenant additions, but I also wanted to know if there's anything assumed in there with regard to amendment or escalation activity. And then with regard to that, can you also -- I apologize if I missed this, but can you give us any idea of how long you may think it will take from a time standpoint to possibly move from that 5% to the 15% levels?","W. Benjamin Moreland","As soon as we possibly can would be about all I can answer to the second one. But in terms of -- if you look at the historical legacy sites, that $90,000 of revenue per tower obviously includes amendments over time, as well as escalations over time, which all goes into that roll-up of that number. We've elected to give you a simple metric, not the only metric, but a simple metric around tenancy because that seems to be helpful for people to be able to quantify to kind of get it around their -- in their head about how many tenants per tower and then what the opportunity is. But over time, obviously, existing tenants and new tenants amend, as well as escalate, and that all contributes into that overall 15% yield on invested capital on those legacy sites. And again, to your timing question, as soon as we possibly can. That's about all I can tell you.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Well, yes. And with regard to that, I noticed that the left-hand column, obviously, you owned and operated for greater than 10 years. Getting the 15%, has that been somewhat linear or more parabolic?","Jay A. Brown","It's over -- the average term that we've owned those assets is about 14 years. It's been fairly linear over that period of time. And I think one of the dynamics, Michael, when we talk about the business and there was an earlier question about do we see activity flowing in the first half or the second half of the year. I think our observation would be that while it is common for people to look at our business and try to find inflection points where maybe the carriers are going to spend a lot more capital or spend a lot less capital, as we look at our business over a long period of time, the capital spend on our sites has been relatively consistent within a relatively small band of up or down. And so as we look at our business, we are left prone to try to find the inflection point and look more for themes. And the theme to us is that the carriers are seeing tremendous growth from data, and that is a long-term runway that we think is going to continue to drive site rental revenue and, ultimately, AFFO per share, and that's how we've made the bulk of these investments over the last couple of years.","W. Benjamin Moreland","The only thing I'd add to that is, while it may be tempting to think that those legacy assets are \"full and done.\" As we continue to parse through our portfolio and look at it every quarter, those legacy assets continue to lease at a very attractive rate and add additional revenue and, obviously, escalation off of a bigger number. So they continue to grow and more than pay for their -- pay their way around here, and that continues.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And one other thing, I think you mentioned today, as far as back at PCIA in the spring that there were some portfolios, I believe you said, at that time in Europe where some infrastructure funds had been outbidding yourself and perhaps some of the others. When you look at these portfolios of assets, can you help us understand where the disconnect or, maybe not the disconnect, but where the sticking point is, where the difference in methodology when you value those portfolios versus some of the others who are obviously paying more?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. Obviously, I don't know what's behind other's view. We can only speak for ourselves. We come at it and look at what is the co-location opportunity in those markets. How much capital will the carriers actually spend in those market. That was our attempt in that one page today to talk about the relative scale opportunity in the U.S. versus emerging markets or either -- even some other developed countries. The U.S. continues to just be enormous by comparison. And so we look at the opportunity around lease up. We also -- we look at the sort of inherent cost of capital and risk-adjusted return that you need to apply to an asset when you send a wire transfer into a different currency on that one day. That's not dollar cost averaging in, you're long that day but with very little variable input into the cost structure of our business. So it's -- I liken it sometimes to find power plants in foreign countries, you're sort of long that day. So you have to put up a cost of capital differential into the currency at just sheerly from difference in currency risk, and local borrowing rates in local countries are pretty good proxy to start. So we put all that in the pot and walk through it. And our result at the end of the day is we have found that either buying your own stock or buying assets in the U.S. market tend to, we think, provide a higher risk-adjusted return on invested capital. Others differ and disagree, but that's our view. And from time to time, that causes us the pass on what would initially be a very accretive acquisition, but we don't think that's the right sort of barometer for whether the acquisition is a long-term value creating for the company.","Operator","Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions if I may. The first one, as you ramp up integrating the AT&T portfolio and then obviously you've had the T-Mobile portfolio for now just over 1.5 years, is it fair for us to assume as we go into the back of this year and then increasingly into 2015 -- and I'm not asking for explicit guidance by any means. But is it fair to assume that we should start to see new leasing activity accelerate from this aspect alone? Just curious with that. And then the second question is just on MLAs. It seems like the logic for setting up those MLAs a few years ago seems to have now kind of run its course, at least for some of the carriers. What's the likelihood of renewing MLAs perhaps with different terms both on your end, as well as on the carriers' end, and when could we potentially see that happen?","Jay A. Brown","Okay, on the first question, Colby, when you say -- when you ask a question about accelerating new leasing activity, certainly, on a consolidated basis, we would expect that as a result of integrating these assets, we will have more nominal dollars of new leasing activity coming in. As you look at our supplement and the comments that I made around Organic Site Rental Revenue growth, we have a base that is consistent. So maybe a common term might be something like same-tower sales would be the closest thing to have our Organic Site Rental Revenue number. As the AT&T towers get into a 1-year vintage, if you will, they will go into that math. And I'm not sure I would suggest to you that our organic growth rates will be higher as a result of that because you'll have a then larger base upon which we'll be growing. But I think, certainly, on a nominal basis, we would expect that the leasing activity will pick up at a consolidated level as we have those assets online and we're performing off the full suite of Crown services and leasing activities across the larger portfolio.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","On the MLAs?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I mean, just to punctuate that, the 9% organic growth, if that opportunity exists in the market as we certainly believe it does and that continues from -- on a multiyear track, we'll be just fine. In terms of your second question on MLAs, Colby, we'll look at it as facts and circumstances dictate as things come up, as we always do. And we try to be economically rational and make the right decision on what's going to result in the best outcome for us and the most expedient way to handle the amendment activity or desire of the carrier to get on the site. So that goes together but it's -- we'll look at it facts dependent and I really wouldn't have any prediction today as to where that will take us in the future.","Jay A. Brown","I think we would look at the ones that we've done today and feel like we cut very good deals and think we did better than the we otherwise would have in most cases, so...","W. Benjamin Moreland","We do back check that, and so far so good. We're very pleased with the outcome there.","Jay A. Brown","We're all living with, today, the flip side of the arrangement that we made with Sprint years ago related to the iDEN decommissioning that they indicated was coming to us. And we saw benefit on the upside from the early days of network vision, and today we look at that run rate and its about 6% roughly above where we were going into the process. So we're feeling in the results today and will next year, the downside of it, the decommissioning side. But on a net basis, the result of that agreement was up about 6% from where it would have been otherwise. So we do backward look at each of these that we've made and feel like in each case, we've done really well. And I think also from a carrier perspective, their goal in doing those was to accelerate and speed up the process in which they've gotten on our towers and I think if you were to ask them, I think they would indicate to you it certainly accomplished their goal as well.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP","So it seems like the cash -- tower cash flow margins have been declining sort of steadily over the course for last year or so. Is the pressure all been a function of the investments you're making for the T-Mobile and AT&T towers or are there other factors, depressing margins there as well? And can you give us a sense for how quickly you expect margins to reinflate now that you're sort of at the end of the integration process with AT&T?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, Jonathan. Yes, the decrease that you've seen in our tower cash flow margins have all been a result of the acquisitions that we've made. We've acquired 2 portfolios that had respectively 1.6 and 1.7 tenants per tower with T-Mobile and AT&T, so the margins on those assets were significantly lower than the legacy towers that we had that had margins in the high 70% range and 3 tenants per tower. So as we put those lower-leased assets into the portfolio, it lowered our overall margins. I think most of that is basically in the run rate, as I mentioned in my comments, both on the expense side and the revenue side at this point. And so absent any other acquisitions, I think we'll go back on a pace where you see expanding margins on the go forward, all driven by the amount of top line revenue growth that we have.","Operator","And that question will come from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Ben, do you think the networks are keeping up with the demand or is utilization increasing or decreasing? And is there much variability between the different carriers at this point? And then secondly, maybe can you talk about it, is there much shift in CapEx going on at this point? Like are we basically done with the fiber buildouts and a lot of the incremental CapEx is going to be more success-based antennas or lawn carts? Any thoughts there would be great.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure, in terms of keeping up with demand, just as a casual observer and listening to carriers' calls, I would say no. And from watching their behavior, where they're going very, very aggressively towards adding capacity, you have to conclude no, they're not keeping up. And that's a good thing for us. It's a good thing for them, as a matter of fact, because there's more ARPU out there to -- as the pie grows to argue over. And so that's a good dynamic as the entire industry grows but just given the behavior and the speed and the pace in activity that we see, I honestly don't remember it being any busier than it is right now for us. So -- and that goes to really everything that we see, whether it be services activity, leasing activity. Obviously, we have this little integration going on, which adds a little level of complexity for what we see. And then the growing and building small cell side of the house, we are as busy as we've ever been. So I would have to conclude that, that's going to continue for some time and is fundamentally a result of all of us, as consumers, continuing to eat a lot of bandwidth. In terms of it being level smooth between all the different carriers, I talked about that a little earlier. It is a little bit different depending upon where the carrier is in their LTE deployment cycle, and with Verizon and AT&T being further ahead than Sprint and T-Mobile. But that doesn't give us really any pause because I think the dynamic of the spend to capture that incremental dollar is true with all of the carriers, and we fully expect them to come back and add density to their networks over time. We're already seeing that, just very beginnings with Sprint; we expect to see that with T-Mobile. We're seeing some of those early conversations. And then as I mentioned earlier in my comments, that's very aggressively happening with Verizon and AT&T right now.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then on -- any shifts in CapEx spending?","W. Benjamin Moreland","No. I mean, I think we see this as sort of a continuous program from -- for the foreseeable future; less sort of cycles and swings up and down, and more of a steady pursuit of more and more bandwidth and capacity in these networks as -- whether you're talking machine-to-machine or tablet growth. All these things that are expanding the usage of the network and expanding the revenue opportunity is a very good dynamic for our business and for the carriers, and that's what's happening right now.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And I guess lastly, you've been doing 17% AFFO growth per year. This year's a little bit below, too many acquisitions. Do you think you can get back to the 17% level on a sustainable basis?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Well, I don't know about that. But you'd have to at least give me credit for the dividend this year. So the 13% would really be 15% if you added the dividend. So we think that's pretty good given the acquisitions we've done and everything we're working on and the Sprint churn headwind that we had this year. So if you were to adjust for the sort of the odd nature of the iDEN churn, that number would be actually be 16% this year, plus the dividend of 2%. So look, you can tell from the gross activity that we're pretty excited about what we see, and we got a lot going on.","With that, I think we'll wrap up the call. I know there's a -- it's a very busy earnings week for everybody. I appreciate you jumping on the call with us now for 70 minutes, and look forward to seeing you at some conferences in the fall and on the third quarter call. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank everyone for your participation, and have a great day."],"6220":["Crown Castle International Corp.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Son Nguyen. Please go ahead, sir.","Son Nguyen - Vice President, Corporate Finance","Thank you, Vickie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our second quarter 2016 results. With me on the call this morning are Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.","To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning. This call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and actual the results may vary materially from those expected.","Information about potential factors, which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors section of the company's SEC filings. Our statements are made as of today, July 22, 2016, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","In addition, today's call includes discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the Supplemental Information Package in the Investors section of the company's website. In response to recent public comments and guidance by the SEC regarding the use of certain non-financial measures, we have adjusted the presentation of our quarterly earnings information including information in our Supplemental Information Package.","We have not changed the definition of our continuing non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call or in the quarterly earnings information.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Son, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our earnings release last night, we had another quarter of great performance, meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our previously provided second quarter outlook and allowing us to increase our full year 2016 outlook. The results reflect our continued focus on creating shareholder value through solid execution, disciplined capital allocation and strong balance sheet management, all of which positions us to achieve our goal of delivering long-term annual dividend growth of 6% to 7%.","What I'd like to do this morning in my prepared remarks is spend just a few minutes providing a bit more detail on each of the key focused areas that underpin our ability to drive our 6% to 7% per year dividend growth and then hand the call over to Dan to talk about our financial results for the quarter.","The first point I'll touch on is our long-term track record of execution. We have a highly motivated very talented team of people who are dedicated to delivering strong results. They have developed the systems and processes necessary to operate and manage our business to generate strong cash flows through a variety of business cycle.","Additionally, we've been able to grow through both organically and acquisitions, including integrating those acquisitions effectively. This solid execution has resulted in very good financial performance. Since 2007, we have grown AFFO per share from $1.33 to our current expectation of $4.71 for the full year 2016, representing 15% compounded annual growth per share. Additionally, since 2014, we have returned approximately $7 per share in dividends, further enhancing the return for our shareholders.","The combination of our track record of execution, the quality of the portfolio of assets that we have accumulated, the secular tailwinds of an increasing demand for wireless connectivity and the strength of our business model position us well to capitalize on the positive industry trends we are seeing coming our way, which is the second topic I want to highlight.","As we look to the future, we believe wireless carriers will continue to invest in their network infrastructure, as they take advantage of what many expect to be a multi-fold increase in mobile data usage between now and 2020.","Specifically, we believe our runway of growth is supported by the amount of spectrum that is expected to be deployed over the next several year, including spectrum from last year's AWS-3 auction to spectrum currently held by the carriers and others such as DISH and FirstNet that is yet to be deployed and spectrum from future expected auctions.","Further out on the horizon, we expect the deployment of 5G will drive growth on both our tower and small cell assets, as the carriers look to densify their networks to provide the coverage, capacity and speed needed to support mobile video, the Internet of Things, fixed wireless broadband, and other developing use cases. Given these expected developments and consistent with carrier commentary, we expect the carriers to continue to invest over the long-term to maintain and improve network quality.","As the leading U.S. provider of towers and small cells, we have the opportunity to lease our assets and capture significant organic growth by providing the wireless carriers with a comprehensive offering of wireless infrastructure solutions. In addition to the organic growth we see in our business, we have also had a tremendous opportunity to invest capital to drive attractive returns, which is the third key area I would like to focus on.","From a capital allocation standpoint, we are particularly excited about the small cell opportunities that we see ahead of us. Because small cells are deployed closer to the end user and in more dense array, such as on traffic lights or telephone poles, they represent the natural progression of network densification required to provide continuous consistent high capacity and low latency connectivity.","This is important as consumers are increasingly looking to utilize their wireless devices for high usage applications, including on-demand video, virtual reality and the Internet of Things. As these demands continue to increase, wireless carriers are increasingly turning to small cells to provide wireless connectivity across urban and suburban geographies where towers are not available or cannot solve the network needs alone.","To get a better understanding of how we think about small cell investments, we would encourage you to think of fiber as a tower. Fiber is the critical shareable element in small cells. Much of the tower structure is the shareable element in macro sites. Similar to towers, the majority of the capital per small cell is invested initially with the first wireless carrier deployment.","This initial investment relates primarily to the build-out of fiber. And again, similar to towers, we expect to increase the yields on our investments over time by colocating additional carrier customers on the fiber we constructed for the first carrier. We are seeing this increase in yields in small cells play out at the pace we expected.","Importantly, in both our tower and small cell businesses, this model of constructing an asset that can be utilized by multiple carriers and other customers reduces the cost for our customers compared to what they would otherwise have to spend to build the assets for themselves. We believe our fiber footprint of 17,000 miles in top mature markets combined with the capabilities that we have acquired and developed over time give us time to market and economic advantages that should allow us to capture a significant share of this large opportunity.","Finally, the last aspect I wanted to address is how we think about financing our business. Our revenues are primarily derived from long-term leases that deliver a stable, growing and high quality cash flow strength, which is the underpinning of our dividends to shareholders. And our investment in small cells represents a significant growth opportunity to further enhance our long-term dividend growth.","Against this backdrop, our goal is to match the quality of our business with a strong balance sheet. We believe that maintaining an investment grade balance sheet provides us with access to a deep, stable and low cost of capital, reducing risk to our cash flows and providing us with increased flexibility to pursue potential investment opportunities that we believe will increase our dividend in the future.","In summary, how we operate, manage and finance our business is focused around growing the dividend. I believe that increasing our dividend consistently over time is the best way to create value for our shareholders. Given the leasing potential of our portfolio of assets, the long runway of expected network activity and our opportunities to invest capital at attractive returns, I believe we are well-positioned to do just that by delivering upon our stated goal of growing dividends per share 6% to 7% annually over the next several years.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan to discuss our financial results for the quarter.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I get to our results, I wanted to talk briefly about my first few months at Crown. When I joined the company, I was enthusiastic and optimistic about the business, the company and the people. As I've spent time meeting with employees, learning about the industry and developing an appreciation for how the company operates, all of my expectations have been exceeded. As I have learned more, I'm starting to really understand how the combination of steady, high quality cash flows, secular growth trends and Crown's solid execution is a hard one to beat.","What I did not realize is how talented and genuinely nice the people are who work here. So I want to thank everyone who's made my transition so smooth. It truly is a great place and I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of it.","With that, I'll now turn to discussing our second quarter. As Jay mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter of financial results, meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our previously provided quarterly outlook. In addition, due to the solid first half results we have generated, combined with what we believe will continue to be a steady leasing environment, we have raised our full year 2016 outlook.","Turning to second quarter results on slide four, site rental revenues grew 9% year-over-year from $737 million to $805 million, inclusive of approximately 7% growth derived from organic contribution to site rental revenues. The 7% or $49 million growth from organic contribution to site rental revenues consisted of approximately 9.5% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalations, net of approximately 2.5% from tenant non-renewals.","Moving to slide five, our second quarter results for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share, each met or exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided second quarter 2016 outlook, reflecting the overall healthy leasing environment.","Moving on to investment activities, during the second quarter, we invested approximately $200 million in capital expenditures, of which $19 million were sustaining capital expenditures and $180 million were discretionary investments. Included in these discretionary investments is approximately $19 million of land purchases we completed to further strengthen our control of the ground beneath our towers.","Today, nearly 80% of our site rental gross margin generated from towers is on land we own or control for more than 20 years. Additionally, the average term remaining on our ground leases is over 30 years. The proactive approach we take to managing the ground beneath our towers is core to our focus of producing stable, growing, high quality cash flows.","The balance of our discretionary investments was in revenue generating capital expenditures that we believe strengthened our portfolio of assets, extended our leadership position in shared wireless infrastructure and enhanced our ability to deliver strong long-term growth and dividend per share.","Moving on to financing activities. During the quarter, we continue to proactively manage our balance sheet, while returning significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share, which was 8% higher than in the same period of 2015.","As part of our balance sheet management, in April, we issued $1 billion of unsecured notes to refinance debt maturities coming due in 2017 to borrowings under our credit facilities. This offering represented the culmination of our long-standing goal of reaching an investment grade credit rating at each of three major rating agencies.","We believe this credit profile underscores the stability and quality of our long-term cash flows, and it lowers our overall cost to capital, which we believe is an advantage in our business of providing shared wireless infrastructure. Following this offering, the only debt maturity we have prior to 2020 is a $500 million tranche of notes due at the end of 2017.","Shifting to full year 2016 outlook on slide six, we've increased the midpoint of our guidance by $3 million for site rental revenues, $3 million for site rental gross margin, $9 million for adjusted EBITDA and $7 million for AFFO.","On an AFFO per share basis compared to 2015, our updated midpoint for full year 2016 outlook of $4.71 represents an increase of approximately 10%. The increase in our full year outlook reflects the strong results from the first half of the year, our expectations that the level of leasing activity from our carrier customers will remain steady, an increase in expected contribution from network services gross margin for the remainder of the year, and the timing benefit related to tenant non-renewals occurring later than previously expected.","It is important to note that our expectations for tenant non-renewals associated with the decommissioning of portions of the Clearwire, MetroPCS and LEAP networks remained unchanged in the aggregate.","Looking beyond 2016, we believe we are in a multi-year cycle of network upgrades and enhancements, as carriers focused on meeting significantly increasing demand for wireless connectivity, which we believe will benefit both our tower and small cell businesses.","Given this backdrop and combined with our leading portfolio of wireless infrastructure across both towers and small cells, we believe that we are well-positioned to achieve our stated long-term goal of delivering compound annual growth of 6% to 7% in AFFO and dividends per share.","With that, Vickie, I'd like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from David Barden with Bank of America.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, two questions, if I could, maybe for you, Dan. If we look at the organic year-over-year revenue growth as you define it in 1Q, it was $7.8 million, in 2Q, it's $6.9 million, and for the full year, it's going to be $6.3 million, as you've been guiding, could you kind of waterfall the contributing factors to that deceleration? I'm assuming it has mostly to do with your inclusion of the small cell revenues in the organic growth number, but if you could kind of map that out for us, it'll be helpful.","And then, second, Jay, I'm sure you know that there's a big conversation out there about the AT&T tower RFP comments from T-Mobile about trying to find quote\/unquote competitors for towers that are getting too expensive. Could you kind of opine a little bit about that RFP and talk a little bit about your portfolio in terms of what you might sense as the percentage of towers that have a combination of expiring leases and very expensive leases coming up for renewal where there might be substitutes near you. It's a topic we're addressing and I'd be great to hear your thoughts on it. Thanks.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Maybe I'll take the second question first, and then, Dan can go through the first question there. We're not going to get into, obviously, specific conversations that we're having with each of the carriers. But as we look at the business, we haven't seen the dynamic change from what it's been like in the long period of time. The towers that we provide to the wireless operators provide them with a very cost effective solution and over time, obviously, tower rents have escalated.","But the main cause of that escalation is the underlying cost of that asset. And we've done a good job, over a long period of time, of extending ground leases, as Dan mentioned in his comments, and investing capital there, in order to own the ground underneath those assets. And like any real estate asset over time, there's appreciation in that overall cost. And so, we feel comfortable about where we are positioned relative to all of the carriers and the provision of where rent is relative to the space that they're using and the underlying cost of the asset.","And while this topic I think over the last six months to nine months has maybe gotten more conversation than what it has over the last couple of years, it's not really a new conversation and we've had this conversation all the way dating back to kind of the 1999 period and it comes up from time to time. And the value equation and the provision of that value to the carriers today is about a 2.5% to 3% cost of lease against the overall cost of the asset and we believe that the very attractive cost provision, as we share the asset across multiple carriers, and in essence provides them with a really low cost alternative, and frankly, we don't see that the pricing dynamic in the business or the overall structure or arrangements that we have with the carriers, we just don't see that changing.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And Dave, to your first question on the organic year-over-year revenue growth, a lot of the leasing activity last year was back-end loaded which, because of the offset of when it comes into play comes into the first half of the year. And so, the early part of the year here \u2013 in this year, looks like there's more growth. And as the activity is again a little back-end loaded this year, we won't see that until 2017.","And we really think of it as a year-over-year basis as opposed to quarter-over-quarter. So the way, I would say it depends on when the timing of the activity comes in, but it's really more of a quarter to quarter anomaly more than anything else. And so, I think the year-over-year is what I would generally focus on.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.","Got it. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Jay, in your remarks in the press release, you talked about a healthy leasing environment, perhaps you could just characterize a little bit more around that. I think that Dan was just talking about second half loaded. So what is the level of activity that you're seeing right now versus say last quarter and versus your expectations? And I think you've said before maybe 60% of the activity in the second half of the year.","And then, there's been a number of press reports just about the challenges of sighting small cells with municipalities, et cetera, particularly for some of the carriers who are not going your route. But can you just talk about where you are in terms of getting what you need from the municipalities been able to deliver on time and on budget for your carrier customers? Thanks.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure Simon, thanks for the questions. On the first question around the leasing environment, we're expecting, as we have been through the course of the whole year, about $170 million of revenue growth, organic revenue growth, comprised of about $115 million on the tower side, and then, about $55 million of growth on the small cell side.","That was really our expectation going into the calendar year 2016, and it's held throughout the year, and we see that holding through the balance of the year, which is why our expectation is unchanged. That is very similar to the long-term expectation that we have in the business that underwrites or underpins our 6% to 7% dividend growth in the comments that I made. So we view that as a very healthy environment. We're seeing activity across the spectrum from the carriers on both small cells and towers and feel good about what that's going to look like for the balance of the year.","On your second question, this has certainly gotten some play, I think, in the news recently around some of the difficulties of sighting small cells as you referenced. And our experience has been that they are difficult to sight and to locate, and I think that underpins a big component of what we think about the business. One would say the same thing about towers, about how difficult they are to get sighted and to get put into municipalities. So it's a great barrier to entry.","And as we look at small cells, we would say the same thing about small cells that they are operationally difficult in terms of moving through municipalities and local restrictions around planning and zoning. They take a long time to do. Generally, our experience has been that it's an 18-month to 24-month process in order to work through that. And on top of that, it's very challenging from an RF design standpoint. So it takes an enormous amount of skill and expertise in order to deploy these.","And both the combination of the high barrier to entry that's created by the local municipalities, as well as the operational expertise required in order to navigate both the RF site as well as the municipalities, we think it's core strength for us, and it's supportive of the business long-term.","And frankly, the more difficult it is, we think it really separates us from our competitors and shows how skillful the team really is. So we are seeing it, but I wouldn't necessarily describe it as worse than what it's been in the past. And frankly, I think it's supportive of the value of the business.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Two, if I may. First, can you talk about competition on the small cell space you referenced a little bit earlier, but are you seeing more bidders for RFPs and is that impacting pricing at all?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know that I would characterize it as we're seeing more competitors than what we've seen in the past, Phil. We do see competitors in the space. It hasn't changed our expectations around returns. We haven't seen the returns that we're experiencing when we're bidding on new small cells. We haven't seen those come down from what we've seen previously. So there are competitors in this space. I wouldn't describe it as a changing landscape. And in terms of returns, we've seen those hold in there where they've been over the last couple of years.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And second, can you talk about network services trends both in the macro and the small cell business?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. In the macro business, which is really the more relevant component, given how small small cell is in services, we have seen an \u2013 as reflected in our expectation for the balance of the year, we're assuming a bit higher capture rate on activity in the back half of the year than what we had previously expected. So we think activity is about the same and we're assuming we capture a few more things. I would point out, I know there's been a number of questions over the last couple of years around items that have been things such as pay and walk fees and other things that we have benefited our services business.","Our expectation of growth here is, really, what we would describe as core services related to installing tenants on the towers or doing amendments, and that's what's driving our increased expectations on the back half of the year.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good. Thanks, Jay.","Operator","We'll go next to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for taking the question, folks.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","One of the leading equipment manufacturers, Ericsson, made some comments earlier this week on their surprise on the pace of 5G initiatives, particularly in the U.S. There seems to be a lot of debate going on right now on how this technology could impact macro site investments versus the need for increased densification by small cells. You folks seemed to be in an interesting place given your key positioning in both parts of the market.","And so, we'd welcome any thoughts you have on how you think about the potential opportunities or even headwinds as that technology rolls out.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think I would say, similar to what I made in my prepared remarks, that we're going to \u2013 we believe we'll see, in a 5G environment, carriers make investments across both towers and small cells. We don't believe that either one of them could deliver the kind of speed and low latency and ubiquitous coverage that they're describing whether that's regardless of the application that they're trying to ultimately drive towards by the deployment of 5G.","So I wouldn't \u2013 at this point, I wouldn't try to put much more of a finer point on it than that. We think it will benefit both towers and small cells. And as you've referenced, we're pretty excited about our position, because we think we'll benefit from the combination of both.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then, if I may, a quick follow-up to that prior question on the small cell side. I mean it seems like you haven't seen any change in some of the initial returns expected on some of the small cell deployments. Do you think that there's a potential risk of that going forward depending on what happens with certain fiber providers? And the reason I asked the question is that we are hearing that select carriers, outside of the Sprint commentary that's been pretty notable, are looking to densify their small cell footprint by going direct to metro fiber providers. So we'd love your thoughts on that topic.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think if you were to think about this as kind of a long-term business model, we make investments based on the returns as we see them today and there's \u2013 we're not undertaking any obligation or we're not signing up for capital investment in an environment that, in later years, may have lower returns on it than what they do today.","By way of example, if you go back to business and looked at what we did in kind of the 1999-2000 era, we were building a 1,000 towers to 2,000 towers a year back then, because the returns were attracted to the business relative to the cost of capital and what we thought we could drive in terms of shareholder value.","Today, we build less than 50 towers on an annual basis. And the reason for that is because we just don't see the incremental returns as high enough. So if you roll this forward, I would certainly hold out the possibility that there would be competitors in the space and that there would be a change in the pricing environment. And if the returns weren't attractive to us, then we would stop making the investments as we're making now.","We haven't seen that to be clear though. Today, what we're seeing is very attractive returns and an opportunity to invest capital that we think will further our growth rate over time. And similar to the comments that I make about building towers or building new fiber, the assets that we already have today, we would expect, over the long period of time, to continue to see lease-up which would drive those incremental yields and incremental returns.","So I think if it's really as we're choosing today to invest in and build immature assets because we believe there will be an environment over time that will fill those assets up and increase the yield over time. And then, as we get into future periods, frankly, we'll just have to make the right capital allocation decision and ensure all along the way that every time we make the investment, we're doing so because we believe that will increase our dividend growth over the long-term.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And Amir...","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Amir, it's Dan, just to follow up on that a bit, you can see in our second quarter results for the small cells that the investments that we've made today are actually coming in at returns that we find very attractive and I think you'd find very attractive for those new assets that Jay is talking about. So I think that even the financials we're showing today can kind of bear out what Jay was talking about.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much, Dan.","Operator","We'll go next to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi Ric.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Continue the small cell theme. Jay, you mentioned that small cells are hard to do, takes a lot of skills that you guys have, could be 18 months to 24 months to kind of build them out. Have you thought about being able to provide us maybe some of the pipeline or backlog that you have? You mentioned $55 million of organic revenue from small cell building construction in 2016. But how should we think about what you're looking at, at 2017 and even 2018 to get a little more comfort on kind of filling Amir's questions?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think, Ric, the best way probably to describe it is, at this point, we think the buildup that we'll see in 2017 is similar to the levels that we've assumed in 2016. We'll give you more guidance on that as we get towards October and giving you a full outlook in 2017.","But at this point, I think where I would guide you towards is, as we talked about in the past, the $170 million of revenue growth in the business is about $115 million from towers and the $55 million from small cells. That's what we've baked into our longer term forecast, driving towards that 6% to 7% dividend growth. And so, as you're thinking about the model, at least the way we're thinking about the model is a level of growth that's similar to what we've seen in the last couple of years.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And I think you also mentioned, think of the fiber as kind of the tower asset. And I noticed this time the fiber miles are listed at just 17,000. I think last time might have been 16,500. Was there an increase in the fiber or was it just you guys are going to a rounded point there?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","There's increase in the fibers. We're making investment in building up small cells. Our mix of colocation and new is similar to what we've seen this year of about 30% colocation and about 70% of what we're doing is building new anchor build systems.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And the last question, churn continues to kind of slip out each quarter the expectation, it looks like this quarter, the expected churn from acquired networks shifted about $5 million out of 2016 into 2017 based on the supplement. What are you seeing there, and is it possible that that churn might not ever manifest itself?","Daniel K. Schlanger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think what we're seeing is exactly what it looks like, which is we thought the churn was going to come in 2016. We pushed out to 2017, because we now believe that it will be in 2017. It would be great if it never manifested itself. It will be something we'd be really happy about, but as you can tell from what we put in the supplement, right now, we think the aggregate level of churn is going to stay what we thought it has been over time.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.","Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Regarding your comments around the focus on growing the dividend and maintaining a solid balance sheet, I was hoping you could talk a bit about how you balance those goals against your level of investment in small cells and whether you think it'd be appropriate to or if you'll have to issue any meaningful amount of equity in the future.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think, Nick, it's a good question around how we're spending the capital and overall cash flow in the business. And at this point, as we're talking about guiding and thinking about our expectation of investment, we really don't see that at the current level. But there may be opportunities in the future that would lead to that. And again, I would point you back to the discipline that we've shown over a long period of time and would expect to show in the future as we look at those investments.","There are obviously opportunities that would make sense to pursue and may include some equity associated with it. But you can be sure if that were the case, we're looking at this on a real cost of capital associated with that and then going back to does it really at the end of the day drive the dividend.","Now, one thing I would point out is don't miss the growth in EBITDA that we've got generating in the business. And the aim here is to run the balance sheet at about five times debt to EBITDA. And so over time, we're creating leverage capacity even as we go towards our target of five times debt to EBITDA. And at this point, we think that's sufficient to cover the investment that we're making in small cells, as well as covering the dividend.","You can see that maybe a real quick look at just look at the cash flow statement. First six months, we got about $900 million of cash flow from operations, $600 million of dividends and we got about $392 million of CapEx. So year-to-date, there's about $92 million or so of CapEx in excess of the cash flow. Obviously, that's well within our ability to handle by drawing under the revolver given the growth in EBITDA.","Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson","Okay. That's great. And then, maybe I can slip in one on small cells. What portion of your base is small cells? Would you characterize as being in what we think of as being called classic big city urban locations like New York or Philly as opposed to other areas like the high-end residential example which you gave in last quarter's presentation. And is the pipeline any different than the base of business?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. About 90% of the revenues in those fiber, et cetera, would be in our top 10 to 15 markets in the U.S. If you were to look at areas that were outside of that, they make up venues and other things that wouldn't be in those top markets, there is about 2% of our revenues in high-end locations that'll be outside of top markets. So the vast majority of the cash flow is being generated in those top markets, and the vast majority of the fiber that we've built from small cells we've constructed are in those top markets.","Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson","Okay. That's great. Thanks so much, Jay.","Operator","We'll go next to Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Good morning. So I had a question about \u2013 there's a comment yesterday that one of the operators said that they are going to be doing 35,000 carrier adds this year, approximately double the levels of last year. And I just wondered that kind of activity, how does that manifest itself in terms of generating amendment revenues on the legacy AT&T assets that you now own versus the legacy Crown assets that were not bought from AT&T, what will be some of the differences and how you see revenues from that type of activity?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Jonathan, we would see that in the form of increased recurring revenue, site rental revenues of the carriers and I don't want to speak specifically to the example that you raised, but across all of the carriers, as they look to improve their network and increase the capacity or utilize additional spectrum, the results of that is amendments on our site and on our sites which drive increased site rental revenues. I think we've mentioned this the last couple of quarters, but at this point, virtually, every lease that we see on our sites is carrier of that equipment, that's driving additional revenue growth, and we're obviously seeing that reflected in the results.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then, on the 2016 AFFO outlook, I noticed there's a $10 million increase in expenses, and I apologize if you addressed that earlier, but what's driving that?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","A couple of items I would point to. One is on the services side, given the increase in activity, there's a little bit of additional cost that we incur associated with that. Some of it is the \u2013 another component of it is our outperformance for full year 2016, our expected outperformance against our original plan drives some increase in our expected employee bonuses.","And then, I would also point out that as we look at the year moving up the bottom end of the guidance, as we did in this quarter and as we did prior quarters, that just migrates the cost structure towards a little higher end. So a lot of that is honestly just narrowing the range.","In terms of expectation which is, frankly, probably more helpful, if you think about modeling the business, from the Q1 level of G&A, we basically think it runs flat for the whole year. So we have previously been assuming, based on the guide, that there was going to be some cost that were going to come out and we're forecasting that to basically be flat for the balance of the year for the reasons that I gave you.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then, finally, you broke out land purchase CapEx through towers and small cells, I believe, for the first time, it's a solid amount, but I just wondered if that's indicative of more land CapEx activity going forward in the small cell business.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, not really. Not indicative of that.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Well, thanks very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. You made a comment, Jay, and you've done it before where you compared the small cell business to the macro tower business and referenced fibers being comparable to towers. But when I think of the tower business, I think of that is, at this point, a very well-defined and structured business. There's not much variability from one build to another in terms of getting a required initial yield and you guys talked about with the small cells business getting on average typically 6% to 7% initial yield, when you deploy it for an anchor customer.","And I guess my question is how standardized is that? I mean does that vary quite a bit? I mean are there some small cell deals where you're doing right now and it's actually something below that and there's others that are well above that, and it's really averaging that 6% to 7%? Or are you seeing that pretty consistently deal by deal?","And then, my second question, you guys have talked about 6% to 7% AFFO and dividend growth over the long term, you've mentioned it again on today's call. But when I look at the growth that you're doing right now, the 10% AFFO growth, the 8% dividend growth, I appreciate you have the converts, I appreciate the law of large numbers, but is there anything else there that we should be aware of that would explain why we could see a few hundred basis points reduction in growth perhaps as we go into the next year? Thanks.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. On your first question, there are obviously \u2013 and you would expect there would be anytime you're investing the amount of capital that we're investing. I'm sure we could find you a couple of examples that would be outside of that normal range. But the vast majority of the investments that we're making in small cells would come in right around the average that we're giving you in terms of returns. And you're correctly pointing out that's the way we would think about it.","So it really depends on market dynamics and other things around where the exact dollars are. So we're really pricing this to yields. And we're seeing the vast majority of them fall within the range that we're giving you around at initial investments for an anchor carrier.","On your second question on the target, maybe an easy way to think about it is, in this calendar year, the 10% is benefited by about 200 basis points from acquisitions that we made that were immediately accretive. And so, that would take it down to kind of the 8% range. And then, from there, you correctly point out the convert, the preferred that we have coming due at the end of this year.","So maybe a simple item would just be to take that 10%, make it 8% with the acquisition and very well maybe that over time we find opportunities like that that are attractive, accretive acquisitions, but we're not going to bake into our updated forecast.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Couple of questions. First, on the guidance for the year, you increased it slightly because of the delay in churn, but it looks like the new leasing revenue growth is also expected to be slightly lower. Can you talk about the driver for that?","And then, the second question on small cell margins, looks like it picked up nicely year-over-year. Is this a good level that we can continue to see? Where do you think margins for small cells could get to over time? Thank you.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Batya. So on the first question, on new leasing, you can see that we actually haven't changed our outlook on that. It was $170 million in our prior outlook, and it's $170 million now. I think one of the things that we're noticing is we give ranges of these things, which is the approximations we put in those charts, and it gets to be too precise. And so, I would not extrapolate that to say that our new leasing activity is any different. As Jay pointed out, it's what we thought it was going to be at the beginning of the year. It's held through this year, $115 million from towers and $55 million from small cells.","And then, in terms of the small cells gross margins, those will fluctuate quarter to quarter, but generally, what we see is that we look at this more like Jay was talking about on the returns that we get in these projects and the kind of the overall margins we get may fluctuate depending on how the deal is structured and what happens and when things come on. So it's probably not going to fluctuate terribly from where it is now, but I wouldn't focus on that as the driver of how we would think about the incremental investment in those projects.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike McCormack with Jefferies.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hi guys. Thanks. Jay, maybe just a quick comment on the AWS-3 deployments, what you're expecting from a timing perspective? And then, just also second on 5G, just your thoughts around what that means to you, guys, opportunity, threat.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. On the first one, AWS-3, it's a component of what we're seeing in terms of leasing activity and our expectation would be that, as we go through the balance of this year and into 2017, it's going to continue to be a component that's embedded in our $170 million of increased leasing activity that we would expect.","5G, it's important I think whenever we talk about kind of longer-term, where we think the growth rate in the business, the thing that we like to point out to investors around future opportunities is the level of activity that we've seen from the carriers over a long period of time is inside of a relatively close band of activity. And so, we would look at 5G, for instance, or additional spectrum that we think we'll get auctioned off or FirstNet.","And we would look at all of those opportunities that's likely to extend the runway of growth in the business. And so, at the moment or in the near term, we may see more benefit from an AWS-3 like deployment or additional carriers being added across the towers for various reasons today. And then, over the longer term, we would look at it and say, we will probably see activity from things like the deployment of 5G and FirstNet and other spectrum that's not currently being used by the carriers.","So I would describe that as extending the runway of growth. It's probably the best way to think about it.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, Jay.","Operator","We'll go next to Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Thank you for fitting the question in here. So look, I'd like to ask a couple more questions on small cell, if you're not too tired of hearing about it. But it's interesting in terms of you laying out the development and expected yields over time. And I was wondering if you could give us a sense, because in the past, you've talked about most of the capital being for anchor tenant builds, if that's still the case, if you could give us a little color on sort of where the tenancy is.","And then, more specifically, if there're any older systems that you have out there where you could sort of isolate the economics and sort of give us some visibility into how the yields grow over time as the systems mature, I think that'd be really helpful. Thanks.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jonathan, no, we're not tired of talking about small cells. We enjoy the subject. Most of the capital is invested upfront as we build the fiber. That remains to be the case today. And then, over time, you have a couple of things happen. The case studies we talked about last time on the call, I think, are instructive and helpful there.","In both cases, we saw a couple of things happened. One is that over time, we see the initial carrier come back and add additional nodes across a given geography of fiber that, in essence, increases the density. And that looks \u2013 if you're making the comparison to the tower model, that looks like amendments to the base business where that first tenant, the yield associated with that first tenant, in essence, increases across the fiber.","The second thing that we see is that as additional carriers come, they colocate on the fiber that we built for the first carrier, and then, they also, at times, want to extend the fiber into new places. We describe that typically as laterals across that base system. And so, as we have colocations over time, it's a combination of extending the plant as well as colocating across the same fiber that's built for that initial tenant.","And generally speaking, we find the yield fits a pure colocation, we'll find the yields as we move into the second tenant into the teens. And then, as we get to the third tenant, as we showed you last quarter, we'll be plus 20% oftentimes by the time we get to the third tenant.","Some of that mix depends on how many colocations go there, the density with which they go across a given geography of fiber and then, how many laterals do we put in, are we extending the fiber mix. So really, the value proposition there, as we think about it to the carriers, is that the shared infrastructure just like we do with towers and it provides a very cost effective way for them to deploy across that fiber.","And then, once the fiber is in the ground, it becomes the speed to market advantage that we have, because we're able to install them on the fiber that we've already deployed for the first carrier.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.","Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US)","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just back on the small cell deals you've been talking about, could you just help me understand how you factor in prepaid rent into that 6% to 7% initial yield you talked about?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Spencer. We call it checkbook math around here. So we would think about it as what's the net received after the amount of \u2013 the net capital invested, meaning the growth capital we put in day one against any upfront receipts of prepaid rent that we get from the carriers. So that's a sort of net concept of capital investment against the monthly recurring rent that we would receive and then annualize that. So we're looking that as, on a cash yield basis, net investment against annualized margin from the systems that we deploy.","Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US)","Got it. And just to sort of clarify look at your total portfolio, you've talked about investing $3 billion of capital into your total small cell footprint. About how much of that invested capital base would you sort of net out from your prepaid rent denominator?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would take about $500 million out of that. So net investment is about $2.5 billion.","Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US)","Got it. Thanks. And...","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","You write back to about your 6% to 7% yield across that whole base. And keep in mind, we initially started with about $1 billion of that, went in about a 3% initial yield. So of the $2.5 billion, about 40% of that went it at about a 3% yield. The rest of it would have gone in, in the ballpark of about a 6% to 7%. So we've driven the entire investment up to 6% to 7% total return there, which sort of speaks to, as Dan mentioned earlier, if you look at the incremental return, if you just take Q1, look at the incremental capital we invested during the quarter, and then, see what the returns on that capital are, you can see why the base of the overall capital and the increase on yield has occurred over time, we're continuing to see that happen in the sequential results.","Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks. And just one housekeeping question. You closed TDC and that added about $8 million of, site leasing revenue to your tower business sequentially. I noticed that revenue only increased $3 million sequentially for towers and I'm sort of curious why it didn't go up by more.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We actually included the TDC in our prior outlook. So if you look at \u2013 we included that and so the site rental revenues were up from \u2013 and our \u2013 the outlook we had last quarter. And so, this is just in and above what TDC was.","Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US)","Yeah. I was actually talking about reported results from Q1 to Q2.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No. We have a combination of \u2013 we had \u2013 did one-time items in the first quarter and then...","Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US)","Got it.","Daniel K. Schlanger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","...the net impact of churn I think is probably going to reconcile you the balance of the way, Spencer.","Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered, and I'm sorry if I missed this one, but back with regard to the small cells, can you talk a little bit about whether you think you're seeing or will see a little bit more demand either from a coverage or a capacity standpoint for small cells, as we go forward, or am I not thinking about it the right way?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","No. You are. I think we'll see \u2013 typically, what I would say is that it's going to be a capacity issue that would be the biggest driver of what we're doing for small cells. There are places where there's virtually no coverage today from macro sites. And so, we're going in and covering an area where there's no coverage. But typically, where these small cells are going is there's a capacity issue where there's a macro site providing, we often think about it as an overlay and an underlay strategy.","So there's a macro site that's providing good coverage, but from a capacity standpoint or a latency standpoint, the carriers utilize small cells to underlay that macro sites and increase the capacity of both the macro sites as well as using of small cells to increase the capacity of their overall network. So they're synergistic in their usage in those cases.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Historically, Ben used to talk about kind of charging for space and weight on the towers. If I'm reforming spectrum and I'm using existing equipment, do I have to pay more and I guess same thing if I'm using new spectrum. Maybe just how the pricing model has shifted a little bit and it would seem fairly complicated to kind of do this on every location. So would you expect to see more master lease agreements or new master lease agreements at some point?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Tim, the pricing model hasn't changed. So we continue to charge customers if they pick up space and weight on the towers. And I think your question is, you could say if there's a theoretical answer where the carriers could literally reutilize the space in a different way, there may not be additional rent for that. That's not been our experience over a long period of time. Typically, if they deploy additional spectrum or new spectrum bands on new equipment, they do make modifications to the site in order to improve the coverage or the capacity of the site and that's what results in additional rent to us, and frankly, we haven't seen that behavior change.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. And do you think that will drive master lease agreements at some point given all the changes occurring?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't necessarily dismiss it as never going to happen again. There was a point in time where the conditions were, I think, very favorable for us to strike a transaction like that where the carriers knew they were going to touch \u2013 or several of the carriers knew they were going to touch all of their existing sites. And so, they were willing to pay us for an amendment across all of the sites in order to accomplish that.","If those conditions were right, from a financial return standpoint, those transactions worked out very well for us. But we don't have any today and, frankly, I wouldn't necessarily tell you that we would expect for those to occur again.","But I would also say based on the value that we received from the transactions that we did previously, if there was a similar opportunity, we would certainly study it closely and figure out what the best approach was.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then, lastly, just a follow-up to David's first question. With the towers, have you seen any of your competitors willing to lower prices or do more term and volume contracts at lower prices or any new entrants in which clearly seems to be what the carriers want? But have you seen any of that activity?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","We haven't seen anything of any material in nature. As I referenced earlier, if you look at where we're building towers which is very few today, there have been people who've been willing to come into the space, because they wanted to start a tower business or expand a tower business. And so, they've been willing to do tower builds at economics that aren't really attractive for us to go build sites.","Those occurred though in places where there is not existing coverage and most likely to occur in places where there's a new neighborhood in the suburban location. And we just choose not to pursue those given the low returns.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Can you just refresh our memory or at least my memory on why you guys stopped reporting nodes for small cells? Because it seems like that would be a pretty interesting metric to look at as far as nodes per mile and see how that business has ramped, or maybe otherwise, could you provide some sense of how many nodes you guys are adding per year?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Walter. We talked about this a little bit last quarter. And I think some of it was confusion around the nomenclature of what does a node mean. And so, we tried to focus the conversation much more on revenues and yields to show the return. I wouldn't dismiss the idea that, at some point over time, maybe we do come up with a way to show that in a way that makes sense.","But what we found when we were disclosing it was it actually was not very helpful for people in building their models, and frankly, caused people to draw conclusions that we weren't consistent with the kind of the financial returns. And so, that was the reason why we stopped doing it.","Over time, maybe the nomenclature becomes a little more subtle and maybe there is a way to help with that, but I think in the short term, you'll see us continue to focus on talking about this in terms of financial returns. And then, what you can see, as Dan mentioned in his earlier comments, by looking at the numbers on a sequential basis, you can see with the mix of colocations and anchor builds, you can see those incremental returns being driven.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Okay. And then, just kind of more of a 10,000-foot question. Can you give us \u2013 I mean I know it's early stage, right, Verizon is probably ramping up and other guys are at their even earlier stages. Can you give us a sense of like what the mix is of those service providers selecting someone like yourselves versus maybe doing a build on their own. And then, as that particular customer or type of customer progresses, I would think there might be some bias to shift more towards building your own, as there are vendors kind of like a (57:17) or whoever get a little bit more expertise which they don't have today, that they might want to shift that direction. Have you seen that with Verizon or again from 10,000 feet, kind of where are we today and where do you think we're going to be in that mix five years from now?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","I would probably describe it pretty similar to what we saw in the tower business over a long period of time is that the carriers will self-perform in some cases, and then, you'll have an independent provider of the infrastructure that will do it in other cases.","Haven't really seen the dynamics of that change in the market over the last couple of years. Big picture today, we're probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about half of the activity that gets put out by the carriers. We're winning about half of that business. The pie is growing quickly as multiple providers are now focused on this.","So \u2013 but the ballpark, I would tell you, we're about 50% of the market. The other 50% would be a combination of self-performed by the carriers, and then, other providers winning RFPs. And we, obviously, don't have to have a 50% win rate in order for this, the business, to be interesting to us. It's really around where you have the infrastructure and then what's the incremental returns from there.","Again, back to the earlier conversation, which I think is really important, as we think about this business and compare it to towers is, we believe that a shared solution is the lowest cost solution for the carriers. And we provide that solution for the carriers at a cost lower than what they could do themselves. A combination of that is our own low cost of access to capital, which we have the expertise which we have so we can get it done faster and more cost effectively, just in terms of cost of the deployment.","And then, by sharing it with multiple parties, the entire return and justification for that investment doesn't have to be driven by one carrier. And that model has held out very well in towers and we see the same dynamics in small cells and believe it will continue.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Understood. And then, on the 50% \u2013 the other 50%, you were basically including other people like yourselves. So do you have a sense of, on self-performed, is that like 10%, 20%? And I'm just curious in your five years (59:40) \u2013 to pick any timeframe you want five years, 10 years, 15 years too (59:43) even where that self-perform rate, is that go down, up or is it kind of stay where it is now?","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","I feel like to speculate on that, we'd almost be able to step into what the carriers are going to do and what they're going to invest in sort of the core asset versus maybe non-core infrastructure assets. So I'd probably let them opine on that. We feel good about the value proposition that we provide to them, and then, they'll have start to make their choice over time in terms of how much they want to self-perform.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Maybe we have time for one more question, operator.","Operator","Okay. Our last question comes from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So just two if I could. First, on FirstNet, if you could just give us any updates on the latest you're hearing and timing-wise, when you think this may be potential revenue driver?","And then, just one last one small cells, specifically around the cost side, rental expenses were actually down $3 million sequentially. Just trying to figure out what drove that, and then, on the SG&A side, it's fairly stable sequentially. Do you think we can maintain this sort of similar pacing as the business ramps? Thanks.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Matthew, I don't have any insight on FirstNet beyond what you would have. I think best case scenario, this is a late 2017 early 2018, before it starts to affect our revenues, based on all of the public commentary. But I frankly don't have any insight baseball behind what you would read and know.","I think we continue to believe that, over time, there will be a first responder network that's constructed whether that's at the federal level or at the local level. The legacy systems are aging and there's a real need for it and that we believe the deployment of that system, and then, any of the constructs that are currently being talked about and\/or possibilities, any of those constructs would be good for the tower industry and for us particularly.","On the second question, costs did pick up a little bit sequentially. They're in small cells. And I think when you get to that level of granularity, I wouldn't necessarily point to anything that's indicative of what's going on in the business. What you're going to find over time is as we build new anchor systems and there's mix of anchor and colocations, you may see a little bit of volatility up and down sort of quarter to quarter, but in total, the economics are hanging there as we expected.","On the G&A comment, I would go back to my prior bigger picture comment. First quarter G&A, it looks to us likely it's going to be the run rate for the balance of the year and we're not seeing really any meaningful movements there. Back to the more bigger picture comments that we're asked around what the opportunity is around small cells, obviously, if we were to find more opportunities or ramp up the investment that we're making in that space, then we would need to increase the G&A, but that G&A would come with returns as we've seen in the past.","So it will be a function of the activity that we see and the opportunity to invest capital.","Jay A. Brown - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, with that, maybe I'll wrap up the call. Thank you, everyone, for joining this morning. As you heard on the call, the story is the same as it's been for a long period of time. We're focused on growing cash flows in the business and growing the dividend. And we'll get back to work and look forward to talking to you next quarter about the results. Talk to you soon.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Son Nguyen. Please go ahead, sir.","Son Nguyen","Thank you, Audra, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our second quarter 2015 results. With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.","To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors section of the company's SEC filing. Our statements are made as of today, April 23, 2015, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","In addition, today's call includes discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the Supplemental Information package in the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com. Unless otherwise indicated, our results and outlook that we will be discussing on this call reflects the Australian subsidiary as a discontinued operation. As such, all contributions from the Australian subsidiary has been removed from our historical continuing results and outlook, including for periods prior to May 28, 2015 when we completed the sale of our Australian subsidiary.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Brown","Thanks, Son, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter was another great quarter for our business. Based on the strong results we achieved during the second quarter and our view for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full-year outlook for 2015 for site rental revenues, site rental gross margins, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO.","While I'm going to spend a significant portion of my prepared remarks walking through the various impacts of the two transactions that we announced during the second quarter, I would like to summarize my comments by highlighting, first, that our base business is performing better that our previous expectations. And secondly, the net impact of the sale of our Australian subsidiary and the acquisition of Sunesys is expected to basically be a push with respect to run rate, AFFO per share as we exit 2015.","We believe the combination of these two transactions is additive to our long-term growth rate and further solidifies our leadership position in the U.S. market for wireless infrastructure. By many measures, the U.S. wireless market is the most attractive market in the world for wireless investment, driven by consumers who have a seemingly insatiable appetite for mobile data and the need for wireless to carriers to invest to meet such demand.","Based on the quality of our portfolio of towers and small cell networks, we believe we are uniquely positioned for the long-term to help carriers further densify their networks to keep pace with consumer demand. And we are well-placed to provide shareholders with predictable, long-term AFFO and dividend per share growth.","Turning to our second quarter results on slide 4, site rental revenue grew 4% year-over-year, from $711 million to $737 million. Organic site rental revenue grew 6% year-over-year, comprised of approximately 10% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalations, net of approximately 4% from non-renewals.","Moving to slide 5, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO exceeded the high-end of our previously provided second quarter 2015 outlook, driven by higher than expected network services gross margin contribution, inclusive of $7 million of equipment decommissioning fees.","Turning to investment activities, as shown on slide 6, during the second quarter we invested $219 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $27 million in sustaining capital expenditures and $28 million in land purchases. During the second quarter, we completed over 600 land transactions, of which approximately 20% were purchases. The remaining transactions were lease extensions averaging approximately 38 years.","Today, approximately one-third of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own and approximately three-quarters on land we owned or leased for more than 20 years. This number increases to 90% when we include ground leases of 10 years or more. Where we have ground leases, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years.","Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business as we look to control our largest operating expense and produce growing cash flow over time. Of the remaining capital expenditures, we invested $164 million in revenue-generating capital expenditures, consisting of $103 million on existing sites and $60 million on the construction of new sites, primarily small cell construction activity.","Let me turn now to our strategic moves during the quarter. As I previously mentioned, at the end May, we completed the sale of our Australian subsidiary for approximately $1.6 billion. Net proceeds to Crown Castle was $1.3 billion after accounting for our 77.6% ownership, repayment of the intercompany debt owed to us by our Australian subsidiary, and estimated transaction fees and expenses. We expect to utilize approximately $1 billion of our approximately $2 billion net operating loss carry forward to fully offset the tax gains from the sale of our Australian subsidiary. Additionally, as a result of the sale, we expect a significant portion of our common stock dividend distributions during 2015 will be characterized as capital gain distribution.","The sale was opportune as it allows us to redeploy capital from a slower growth asset towards an opportunity with an expected higher growth profile in Sunesys. Sunesys owns or has right to nearly 10,000 miles of fiber in major metro markets across the U.S., where we already have a small self-presence today.","Sunesys is well-located high-quality fiber footprint, more than doubled our fiber footprint available for small cell deployment. The acquisition of Sunesys is expected to close during the third quarter. Due to the timing difference between the completion of the sale of Australia and the expected closing of Sunesys, we applied the net proceeds from the sale of Australia to pay down our revolving credit facility and term loan.","As such, we expect to re-borrow under revolving credit facility and need cash on hand to fund the Sunesys acquisition at the time of closing. Sunesys is expected to contribute approximately $80 million to $85 million to site rental gross margin with approximately $20 million of general and administrative expenses during our first full year of ownership. We believe that as mobile demand continues to grow, carriers will need to deploy small cells in conjunction with macro towers to address network congestion. And while it's still early days, we are seeing evidence that support our investment pieces.","Year-over-year, site rental revenues from small cells grew in excess of 30%. Today, small cells represents about 8% of our site rental revenue. Our small cells consists of approximately 7,000 miles of fiber supporting approximately 15,000 nodes on-air or under construction with another approximately 2,300-node opportunities awarded but not yet under construction.","Needless to say, we are very excited by the opportunities presented in small cells, which we believe builds on our core competency as the leading provider of U.S. wireless infrastructure, leverages our existing relationships with the wireless carriers and enhances our long-term growth in AFFO and dividend per share.","Shifting to financing activities, during the quarter, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.82 per share or $274 million in aggregate. During the second quarter, we issued $1 billion of securitized notes to refinance other indebtedness. The notes were issued at a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and a weighted average expected maturity of nine years. Today, our weighted average cost of debt stands at 4.2% with a weighted average maturity of six years with no meaningful maturities until 2017.","As of June 30, our total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA is 5.2 times. We continue to maintain our target leverage at 5 times as we remain focused on achieving an investment-grade credit rating. We were pleased that we are recently upgraded to investment-grade by Fitch Ratings, which is an excellent step towards our goal of accessing the investment-grade, unsecured bond market at our holding company.","We believe maintaining an appropriate balance sheet will provide us with flexibility to opportunistically pursue growth opportunities, broaden our access to capital, and lower our cost of capital. As we think about funding potential discretionary growth investments that exceed our ability to fund with cash flow and continue on our path towards investment grade with the other rating agencies, we anticipate financing our discretionary investments in a manner consistent with our leverage target, using a combination of debt and equity as appropriate.","As such, during the third quarter, similar to many other REITs, we intend to put in place an at-the-market program of $500 million which will give us the ability to opportunistically raise limited equity capital if we have opportunities to make investments that we believe will increase our growth rate and future dividends per share. Obviously, we would only expect to utilize equity or debt to the extent the investments exceeded our ability to fund with cash flow, and we believe were accretive to dividends and growth after factoring in the full cost of the capital raised.","Moving on to full-year 2015 outlook on slide 7, we have increased our expectation for the operating results of our business. Compared to our previously provided outlook adjusted for the disposition of Australia, we have increased the midpoint of our full-year 2015 outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.","Our outlook for the third quarter and full-year 2015 does not include the expected contribution from the Sunesys acquisition which again is expected to close during the third quarter of 2015. The increased outlook for site rental revenue and site rental gross margin reflects the strong results from the second quarter and the increase in our expectations for leasing in the back half of the year and an adjustment to the expectation of tenant non-renewals to occur later in the year than we previously expected.","It's important to note that our overall expectations for the number of tenant non-renewals during the calendar year 2015, and in aggregate, remain unchanged. Thinking forward to next year, we currently expect the impact from total non-renewals to be approximately $15 million less than what we expect in 2015. More detailed information regarding out contracted tenant leases and expectations for non-renewals is available on our supplemental information package on our website.","Turning to adjusted EBITDA, the increased outlook for adjusted EBITDA reflects higher expectations for site rental gross margin and our increased expectations for network services gross margin contribution. Our expectation for network services gross margin compared to our previously provided outlook has increased from approximately $260 million at the midpoint to approximately $275 million to $280 million primarily driven by the strong performance year-to-date.","For the full-year 2015, we expect to generate approximately $25 million to $30 million in equipment decommissioning fee, the majority of which we don't expect to repeat in future years. Our third quarter 2015 outlook assumes network services gross margin contribution of approximately $60 million to $65 million with minimal benefit from equipment decommissioning fees.","Moving on to AFFO, the increase in AFFO includes the upward guidance and adjusted EBITDA, offset by an increase in sustaining capital expenditures. We expect an elevated amount of sustaining capital expenditures during the second and third quarters as we continue to integrate and digest our significant expansion in the U.S. Our sustained capital expenditure outlook for 2015 of approximately $90 million includes approximately $20 million in facilities investment, which we do not expect to recur in 2016.","Wrapping up, as we look at the leasing application pipeline heading into the end of the year, I am looking forward to finishing up the year strong and believe we remain on track to generate annual AFFO growth of 6% to 7% organically.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin Moreland","Thanks, Jay. And thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning. As Jay mentioned, the second quarter was another terrific quarter. We continued our track record of delivering great results driven by a strong leasing backdrop as evidenced by our gross organic site rental revenue growth of 10%. Without going into too much detail on specific carrier deployment plans, we are pleased with what we see both in towers and small cell, and the year is ahead of our original expectations. As noted, we believe we're in a multiyear network densification cycle that will result in all four wireless carriers making significant investments and stand ready to meet their needs across the business.","As shown on slide 7, we have a record of execution and growth through various cycles, whether it be macroeconomic or industry-specific cycles. I appreciate that with the sale and discontinued operations treatment, there can be some confusion with our numbers for the quarter and full year. Let me try to simplify this for you. We expect with Sunesys to exit 2015 with run rate AFFO per share equivalent to our expectations prior to the transactions. And we have created the industry-leading portfolio of assets and expertise that is uniquely positioned and focused on the U.S. wireless market.","Today we are the only company with the capability to deliver across all means of shared infrastructure to meet the network densification needs of the U.S. wireless carriers. Of course, this includes our 40,000-tower portfolio, 71% of which are in the top 100 markets, our DAS and small cell portfolio with 15,000 nodes supported by 16,000 miles of metro fiber with the addition of Sunesys concentrated in the top 25 markets, and importantly, the capability to deploy its scale for carriers through our nationwide project management services business and implementation expertise.","The assembly of this portfolio and expertise has been a long-term objective of the Crown Castle management team. But we are now 100% focused on serving the U.S. wireless market, the most attractive market in the world for wireless investment. Although wireless has become a part of our lives, we still believe we're in the early days of products, services, and business models our infrastructure will ultimately support.","Our ability to consistently execute as a function of our business model, the quality of our portfolio with towers and small cell networks, the team that operates the portfolio, and our disciplined approach to capital allocation, and the balance sheet. Our focus remains on co-locating tenants on a long-term committed basis on our shared wireless infrastructure, resulting in increasing yields on our investments, while at the same time, providing the wireless carriers with the most cost-effective access to wireless infrastructure as they seek to intensify their networks to meet growing consumer demand. This demand in the U.S. mobile data market, as reported in a recent Cisco report, grew 63% in 2014, and going forward, Cisco projects a sevenfold increase between 2014 and 2019.","As has historically been the case, network investments by the carriers have generally kept up with consumer usage. We believe the launch of robust content-rich video, including live sports, and unbundling of cable or so-called over-the-top TV products available on wireless devices that promises a new leg of growth in mobile data on wireless networks, requiring more spectrum and infrastructure to realize its full potential. Further, we anticipate current or future spectrum licensees beyond the big four wireless carriers will add to our customer base over time. The derivative demand from DISH, FirstNet and others in the future promises to extend our leasing opportunity beyond what is visible today.","For context, as explained on slide 8, during the 1990s or the 2G technology cycle, average annual U.S. wireless capital expenditures across all the wireless carriers totaled $7 billion. During the 3G cycle of the 2000s, which can be characterized as the era of basic mobile, e-mail and web browsing, average annual U.S. wireless capital expenditures increased to $21 billion across the carriers. And since 2010 with the deployment of 4G and LTE products for mobile broadband, annual U.S. wireless capital expenditures have averaged $29 billion.","Looking forward over the next several years, we believe that the current level of investment by U.S. wireless carriers will be sustained. The U.S. wireless market has one of the most compelling wireless investment stories in the world. With strong unit economics and relatively high ARPU reflecting U.S. consumers' demand for mobile data and their willingness to pay for mobile services, U.S. carriers were able to generate positive incremental returns on their capital investments.","The carriers are driven to increase this investment because as has been true since the early days of wireless, network quality continues to be the market differentiator for carriers' success. Based on this long-term need to invest by the U.S. carriers, we have focused our investments over the last several years in the U.S. market.","Our towers are well located, but over 70% of our portfolio in the top 100 markets and have significant runway for additional growth with only two tenants on average per tower or what I would consider about a 50% occupancy rate. Towers continued to be the most efficient and cost-effective procure us to add network capacity and coverage and support our bullish long-term view on tower leasing. In addition to towers, we have also invested significantly over the last several years in building out small cell networks, with our latest investment being the pending acquisition of Sunesys, as we've mentioned.","Given what we're seeing from the wireless carriers and the challenges they face with bringing more capacity online in many urban and suburban geographies, we believe the deployment of small cells is a critical tool to improving network quality. Similar to towers, we believe some of the best assets will be those that are secured early on where franchise value will help drive future co-locations, upgrade and expansions. And that is why we're so excited about the pending acquisition of Sunesys which will bring our fiber footprint to more than 16,000 miles, more than doubling our presences in the U.S., top U.S. metro markets.","For those not familiar with small cells, this is a shareable, wireless infrastructure that provides wireless carriers with a solution to address network capacity constraints where a macro tower site is not available or is insufficient. Small cells are a fiber-fed solution connecting at network of antennas or nodes that allow wireless carriers to get closer to the consumer, increase network density and deploy spectrum more efficiently. Like tower leasing, tenant leases on small cells are typically long-term with 10 to 15 year committed terms with annual escalators. And like towers, our fiber investment for small cells is agnostic to changes in technology.","And while it is an oversimplification, small cells can be thought of as a tower laid on its side, a horizontal tower, replacing the tower structure in this example with fiber. At its core, fiber is the critical, shareable element in small cells. The vast majority of our investment in building out a small cell network consists of the investment in fiber. Today, we are building small cell networks with initial yields of 6% to 8% that should result in returns above 20% on just a second tenant, reflecting the operational leverage inherent in the business. As Jay mentioned, we recognize that small cells is in its early stages. And we're using our first mover advantage to extend our leadership in U.S. Wireless infrastructure, leveraging our existing relationships with our customers, and enhancing our long-term growth in AFFO and dividends per share.","As is our practice, we constantly evaluate discretionary investments against purchasing our own stock or other available alternatives in the market on a risk-adjusted basis. We believe this disciplined approach maximize the shareholder value over time. We are very excited about the prospects to continue to extend our long and successful track record of growth and value creation.","This business has proven itself to be very durable through economic cycles due to our long-term recurring revenue contracts, contracted escalators, and organic growth profile that we enjoy. Our business, combined with very significant dividend payout, is unique in the market yet trades with one of the highest dividend yields among S&P 500 companies. In fact, out of 421 dividend-paying companies in the S&P 500, 377 companies have a lower dividend yield than Crown Castle, putting us in the bottom 10% pile of dividend payers.","We believe the current valuation is disconnected from the reality of the high quality, predictable yield and growth that we expect the business to deliver and represents an attractive opportunity for shareholders to benefit.","And with that, operator, I've concluded my remarks and would be happy to address questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Jonathan Atkin at RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. So, I was interested in the small cell expectations for the year on [indiscernible], how much of that is going to be from new deployments and initial tenancy versus second or third tenancies on existing small cell infrastructure? And then secondly, if you could comment on which carriers besides Verizon that you would expect to become most active in leveraging this business?","Benjamin Moreland","Sure, Jon. As you've seen before, the bright line demarcation between anchor builds and co-location is a little fuzzy in this business because it's typical that you'll have pure co-location with additional laterals built on an existing system. But as a general matter today, I think the best number I can give you is probably about 80% in anchor builds today and about 20% co-location. That's about as close as I can cut it. And we're going to work on obviously getting that more refine for you over time, but we're very, very pleased with what we see. We've seen that significant amount of co-location on the original NextG systems that we acquired three years ago and more to come.","And speaking of that, you asked about what are we seeing from other carriers? Well, the most active this year has been Verizon as we talked about it. I think they've confirmed on their own call. But we are seeing activity from all four carriers today. And so - and I would say that's up markedly from a year ago in terms of activity and bookings sort of where we are through the midpoint of the year. We're very excited with what we see right now in terms of the prospects for the future business.","Jonathan Atkin","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Michael Rollins at Citi.","Michael Rollins","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two if I could. First, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the new revenue that you're getting from the towers specifically, and as you continue to operate the T-Mobile portfolio and the AT&T portfolio that you purchased, is there an opportunity for that new revenue contribution to get bigger over the next few years?","And then secondly, just if I could ask on small cells. Do you see a risk that a national carrier might go to a single-source supplier for small cells or become more proprietary in their approach for small cells? Or do you see this being a multiple-supplier opportunity? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Sure, Mike. Broadly, we are very pleased with the most recent acquisitions of the T-Mobile and the AT&T towers that we've seen. In any given year, as you know, we've got - both been assets a long time. We know that the various carriers do various things across the course of the year. And the most active carriers this year - no surprise I think to anyone on this call - are Verizon and T-Mobile.","So, AT&T and Sprint less active thus far, but that gives us no less enthusiasm for what the future holds for all four carriers in terms of making investments to improve their network over time. And that ebbs and flows, and that's what's happening today. But we are seeing activity on both of those portfolios and very pleased with the outcome thus far. Again, it's I guess two and three years in on those, so it's still early days.","On the small cell side, I think what we're going to see develop there, and it's already happening, is it's a big world out there. There's going to be a number of competitors; there already are. I think ExteNet, one of our large competitors, announced a transaction this morning in a recapitalization with Digital Bridge. So, I think you're going to - I think it's unlikely any one company frankly has that capability to handle a full-scale deployment for a carrier. I think you could see potentially that on the equipment side, more concentration on the equipment side.","But in terms of the infrastructure, it takes - it will take a number of firms and obviously geography matters. And so, if you've got infrastructure in the critical areas where the carriers need it, well, that's going to be more efficient to go on that existing infrastructure just like the tower model. So, it's a big world out there. It's getting larger frankly by the week as we look at additional bookings that we're getting. And I think it's going to be a very healthy and robust market for many years.","Michael Rollins","Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Phil Cusick at JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick","Hey, guys. Thanks. First, you mentioned activity levels picking up in the press release and you've alluded to this a couple of times, but can you talk about from who and then what ways activity levels are picking up? Is that more for bookings going into 2016 or could we see a little impact in 2015?","Jay Brown","Sure, Phil. The biggest drivers, as Ben just mentioned this year of leasing activity would be Verizon and T-Mobile, and to a lesser extent, AT&T and Sprint. And we've seen pickup kind of across the board as we've gone through the year, but the weighting has stayed relatively similar among those carriers.","Most of the activity that we're seeing in terms of pickup relates to brand new full installations on towers. And the pickup there does have some revenue impact in our second quarter results as we were able to beat sire rental revenue, our expectation for site rental revenue in the second quarter. There weren't any one-time items that really helped us there. We expect that to flow through for the balance of the year, and we slightly raised our expectation for how leasing is going to develop over the balance of the year.","That benefits us as we go into, obviously, 2016. The only caution I would have there for you, as we've talked about in previous calls, from a sensitivity standpoint, we're obviously trying to find every lease that we can possibly find and put as many tenants on the towers as we can possibly find, but a meaningful increase in leasing is not that impactful to our overall results. So, this year, 2015, we assume that we're going to see about $90 million to $100 million of revenue growth on towers. If leasing activity were going to pick up by 20%, love to have it and we'll do everything we can to get it, that's about $20 million which would represent about 1% impact to AFFO.","So, as we've talked about and set our long-term targets of trying to organically grow AFFO per share in the neighborhood of 6% to 7%, inside of that range, we allow for some movement up or down from the current levels of activity. And we think that's a pretty good band of activity. So, we're seeing a little bit of pickup, had a little bit benefit to it this year at the margin.","Philip Cusick","Got it. And if I can ask one more, can you talk about the Sunesys deal a little bit. I assume that they're sort of non-Crown revenue will mostly go into services going forward. And how do you think about that growing? I think you've been building up that team?","Benjamin Moreland","We have been building up a team. The vast majority of their revenue will actually be in our site rental revenues line item. The average term remaining on those contracts is just over five years. So, the terms of the contracts have escalators in them, look similar to what we see on the tower side, the main focus for the acquisition of Sunesys though wasn't necessarily how they utilize the fiber, but our view over the long-term that given the location of this fiber [audio gap] (31:39-31:40) activity, we've seen and opportunities we have in front of us. Currently, there's a lot of opportunity to add small cells across that fiber and increase the yield on that asset. So, most of our focus is really on adding additional small cells to the base of the revenue that's already there.","Philip Cusick","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Simon Flannery at Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery","Thanks a lot. Jay, you talked a little bit about the improvement in leverage and the Fitch upgrades, can you just talk a little bit about where - if you believe - how long do you think it will take one or two of the other rating agencies to upgrade you, and what's the opportunity there on your cost to funding from that? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Yeah. Simon, I hate to put a date on it. We're obviously been working hard with them, have had numerous conversations with them. I think from a financial policy standpoint, we've been really disciplined as we've accomplished acquisitions over the last several years of maintaining our leverage target and operating within them.","Our goal, as I stated during the conversation, is to get the five turns of leverage. We see a path towards that in a relatively near-term as we operate the business and see growth in adjusted EBITDA. As we look at the targets that the other two agencies have published, they would suggest as we get in that neighborhood of that leverage target, then we should see an upgrade towards investment grade.","So, we're continuing to have conversations and tell the Crown Castle story and make sure they understand where we're headed and how we're thinking about being disciplined around financial policy. I think you'd have to ask them in terms of exact timing on when it occurs.","Simon Flannery","And the cost opportunity?","Jay Brown","The cost opportunity is probably about 100 basis points in terms of spread. So, underlying interest rates, obviously, don't have an impact to that. But the spread we think is 100 basis points and on a good day maybe as much as a 152-basis-point reduction in the overall cost to capital. One of the things that you've heard us talk about in the past is we think it's likely, while we're not going to predict exactly when rates are going to rise, the possibility here over time given the broader environment that we enter into are rising rate environment over the next several years. And one of the reasons why we're focused on getting to the investment-grade target is to mitigate that rise in rates by reducing the overall credit spreads in the business. And so, we think we will be able to mitigate some of that and hope to achieve that rating in the near term.","Simon Flannery","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ric Prentiss at Raymond James.","Ric Prentiss","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Son Nguyen","Hey, Ric.","Ric Prentiss","Hey. A couple of questions focused around small cells. Fiber backbone obviously is a large part of the small cell business you guys are doing. We've been picking up some buzz that some carriers are maybe going to consider using spectrum as the primary backhaul mechanism for some small cell deployments. Where is that appropriate? Have you heard anything about that?","Benjamin Moreland","Yeah, Ric, we're certainly aware of other what would be called small cell architectures, and certainly, they have different applications and different power or different coverage and capacity opportunities at a particular node. I think we're going to see a variety of those be deployed over time. I think you're going to see dark service, lit service, some of it with wireless backhaul, some of it with connectivity directly. And I think you're going to see a lot of that over time for a variety of applications. I can't really get into anything specifically. I realized there are some conversations out there about one carrier and potentially what may be going on. Really can't comment on any of that specifically.","But from how we are looking at the business, fiber connectivity will be very important for the vast majority of these connections over time. And even to the extent, you've got microwave backhaul occurring from some small cells, ultimately gets backhauled into a node that's connected to fiber. So, I think the opportunity for us and to provide meaningful capacity enhancements for these networks is ultimately going to continue to reside on fiber-fed systems.","Ric Prentiss","Okay. And then with Sunesys, I think Jay, you mentioned $80 million to $85 million of gross margins in the first 12 months. How much of that, kind of first 12 months, is the core Sunesys business that you have today? How much of that is then poking small cells on top of that fiber?","Jay Brown","Ric, almost all of that would be the margin that comes with the business. And our working assumption is that after we close, as is typically the case, it will take us 6 to 12 months to sort of get our feet on the ground and start to produce additional yield on the assets. So, virtually all of that is in the books today and then we'll look to add it once we get it integrated.","Ric Prentiss","And kind of back to Jonathan's question earlier, organic versus external, will you break out some details for us? I think Jay, you mentioned Sunesys is - most of it is going to show up into the leasing business. How can we get at kind of what Sunesys is coming? Are you going to give us some specific reported segment information maybe?","Jay Brown","Yeah. I think - as we think about the business and the way we're going to operate it, we'll focus on the Sunesys business as being a small cell business and a part of overall small cell. So, that's how we're thinking about how we plan to operate the business. I think we're always looking in evaluating whether or not something warrants being a separate segment in the business. Obviously, over time, small cells have grown. We see more opportunity for growth there. So, as we integrate Sunesys and grow the small cell business, we'll look at whether or not it warrants being a separate segment in the overall financial statement.","I know you've seen this, Ric, but just for the benefit of others. We are providing a significant amount of detail around small cells in the supplement and trying to show both revenue growth on a separate basis there and what we're seeing in small cells. And I think over time, as the business grows, you'll see us continue to expand the amount of detail that we're providing on that business. It's going phenomenally well and we love to telling a good story.","Ric Prentiss","Great. In iDEN churn, did I pick up that you said, churn was a little slower but expect to come in at where it was for the year? Was there an updated iDEN churn number?","Jay Brown","iDEN is coming in as we expected. And as we completed the second quarter, we believe we basically have the vast majority of iDEN churn now behind us. It's going to start - continue to obviously roll through the financial statements for the balance of the year as the current run rate has stepped down there. But our expectation there has not changed.","The three acquired networks that we - we refer to them as acquired networks which would be the lead to Metro and the Clearwire network. We did take down our expectation for the contribution or amount of run rate revenues that impact us during calendar year 2015. But the absolute number of leases that we see churn there, we think holds from our previous expectations. They're just going to happen later in the year.","So, obviously, the impact of that is it will have a little more impact when considering the step between 2015 to 2016. And our best expectation, as we sit here today, we'll give you more full detail on what we think our outlook for 2016 is when we do our third quarter call. Our expectation at this point is we see a step down in the impact from churn next year somewhere in the neighborhood of about $15 million as we look at our outlook for 2016 and the effect of that is basically the runoff of the iDEN churn, as well as little lower less impact from the acquired networks.","Ric Prentiss","Great. Thanks, Jay.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brett Feldman at Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. You've obviously been growing the DAS business significantly, and I imagine you've been investing in overhead and other operating cost items. Can you give us a sense, I mean, what is the EBTIDA contribution from your DAS business today? And at what point should we expect to see maybe more operating leverage coming out of that segment?","Benjamin Moreland","Well, Brett, as you know, it's sort of one of my pet projects I shared with my management team. That will spend a lot of time on this that we have, and I appreciate you acknowledging it, when you're growing a business with the opportunity as large as we see, we're not only investing capital but we're investing in run rate overheard G&A. We're investing in people, facilities, everything you've seen. And that's been the case over the last couple of years.","I would expect - and we're obviously working on giving you some clarity around that for 2016 outlook. I would expect you're going to start to see more operating leverage in that business as we move into 2016. That's just the nature of we're sort of getting close to being sort of that scale. We are seeing, as we mentioned, significant increase in bookings that it will turn into revenue in 2016 and 2017 and more of that will start to scale. I can't put numbers on it for you today, but that is - trust me, it's sort of our first, second, third priority around here right now.","Jay Brown","Brett, one of the things that's unique about this business and just going back from a history standpoint, as we look back to the early days of the tower business, the vast majority of the assets that we owned in the early days of the tower business were towers that we acquired from the carriers. So, we did early transactions with Bell Atlantic and GTE and BellSouth. And those towers came with about a tenant and a half and you had scale.","The hardest thing to do in the early days, when we were running the business, was building towers because we were out building 1,000 to 2,000 towers a year. And as you put those towers on line, it takes a meaningful amount of G&A to operate just purely the construction portion of the business.","And so, when you look at the amount of yields on the assets, if you look out on these two separate activities, one activity is the assets you've already built and then the potential to add cash flows to those assets. As soon as the assets are on line, you start to see incremental returns on those assets. As we add additional capital, though, as we've been doing and build out additional sites, it ends up masking the underlying strength of the business and the expansion of the margins because we're incurring G&A, as well as additional operating expense to build out new systems.","So, as we look at the business and think about how it's performing, we focused on both. We're focused on the investment of capital and evaluating each incremental activity or opportunity to invest capital and we're seeing the opportunity there, day one, of somewhere in the neighborhood of about 6% to 7% yield. And then as Ben mentioned in his comments, as we add a second tenant, we see those returns go into the mid-20s. And so, given what we're seeing on the investments we've made, so far, where we believe appropriately focused on looking to expand that, focused on the top markets in the U.S., and really utilizing our first-mover advantage to continue to expand the portfolio.","And in our view, this is like the early days of towers for small cells, and we've seen the movie before. It's the margin expansion takes a little bit of time. But as we add assets - as we add tenants to great assets, over time we'd see a tremendous amount of expansion on the returns, and that's what we're focused on doing. We think it's beneficial over the long term to our growth rate. So, we're focused on making sure we build the right assets and then grow the cash flows from there.","Brett Feldman","Great. And if I sort of combine that with some other statements you may - Ben mentioned that. You do think you're going to get more operating leverage on the DAS next year. You'd also talked about how some of the churn is expected to diminish next year, which presumably would be better for operating leverage in the tower business, and you're buying fiber in the form of Sunesys that you can deploy revenue on top of that as demand materializes. It just seems like as we sort of sanity-check our numbers for 2016, I know you're not going to give us guidance now, that one of the sanity checks would be there should be much better conversion of revenue growth into EBITDA and AFFO as they move out this year. Is that directionally correct?","Jay Brown","Yeah. I think there's a few things moving on in the numbers, moving around in the numbers. If we talk about services, we're getting some benefit this year from pay-and-walk fees of about $25 million to $30 million that we would not expect to occur again in 2016. So, that will be a little bit of a headwind to us.","On the plus side, we've got sustaining capital expenditures coming down, about $20 million next year, from what we have this year. So, there's a bit of a wash there, maybe a little bit of a headwind, $10 million or so of a headwind. I think where I would go to, though, is focus on where we're focused, which is growth and AFFO per share. And our long-term target of 6% to 7% is where we're trying to operate the business to. Love it if it's more, but our view is that that's about where the business is going to perform given at the current level of leasing.","In 2015 and 2016 that we've shown in the supplement, the headwinds from churn are more significant than what we would expect over the long-term in the business. So, 2015, if you're looking at that on an apples-to-apples basis, we think we're going to be below the target of 6% to 7% coming off of the base in 2014.","Next year, I think we'll probably be inside of that range maybe towards the lower end of it. But inside of that 6% to 7% long-term target. And then we'll do the best we can to do better than that over the course of the year. But once we, at least based on our current view of where churn is and where the various items are moving around, Brett, I think that's the best I can give you until we get to the third quarter to focus on having the business to operate somewhere in the neighborhood of that 6% to 7%. And given the pluses and minuses, at this point, it's probably at the lower end of that 6% to 7%.","Brett Feldman","Great. Thank you for that color.","Jay Brown","Yeah.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Smithen at Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen","I wondered if you could give us a little color on to contracted backlog or bookings in the small cell business, I think you have in the past given us a little color. And I want to see what the change was quarter to quarter and sort of what you're contracted 2016 revenue under backlog would be in that segment.","Benjamin Moreland","Yeah. Kevin, as you know we're not segment disclosing yet on that, to the extent we ever do. But I'll give you some color. Our bookings, thus far, through midyear are up significantly compared to last year. So, that again, will turn in the revenue in 2016 and 2017. I'm not prepared to quantify that directly for you, but it's up materially from what we saw last year. And against our plan for the year, we're running ahead of where you expect us to be midyear. So, we're very enthusiastic about that.","As I mentioned earlier though, a lot of that work is anchor builds. And so, that will come on with a lower margin than you would expect it to be when you lease up to second tenants over time to co-location. So, while it's a material amount of incremental revenue, it gets muted because it's an anchor build on that, and so you're bringing on new operating expenses on this systems as well.","So, look, we'll get you more color I think as we look out - as we think about our 6% to 7% target over the longer term which we originally gave you in 2014. As Jay just walked you through, we picked up about a point next year on reduction in churn. If that continues to normalize, we would expect that happen over subsequent years as well. And so, we're going to continue work towards getting that total return out there that's very attractive between the current yield and growth.","Kevin Smithen","On ExteNet, were you surprised that SBA didn't acquire this asset and doesn't this give you sustainable product suite with advantage with your largest customer or the largest customer horizon on small cells versus your public peers?","Benjamin Moreland","Well, look, as you can tell, we're very pleased with the business. And I think that the ExteNet transaction is - obviously, it's tremendous for the shareholders that are exiting. And I think it's a validation of the opportunity that we see in the marketplace with Digital Bridge coming in. As I mentioned earlier, it's a big world out there, and there's going to be a number of competitors. But the geography, the opportunities continue to, frankly, amaze us, and we're going about as hard as we can. We've told you that before on the other calls and that remains true today.","Kevin Smithen","Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David Barden","Hey, guys. Thanks. So, maybe just, first, Jay, you know, in the supplements, as you kind of point out, there's a nice uptick in the expectations for the new leasing activity from 5.6% to 6% year-over-year. I imagine a portion of that is related to just stripping out the slower-growing Australia business from the comparisons and then some of it is related to kind of the activity. If you could kind of split that out between the two forces, it would be helpful.","And then, I guess, for maybe Ben, just maybe following up on something Ric mentioned earlier. I guess the big conversation now on architecture in towers is always something new, is Cloud-RAN and whether it's wireless of fiber-based backhaul, the idea that we're not going to need as much equipment at the tower from an intelligence standpoint. Could you kind of talk about, A, whether how real it is in terms of what you see happening on the ground in the business. And, B, if it does become real, what does it really mean for your kind of core business view? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Sure. Dave, on your first question, removing Australia does help the growth rate a little bit, but Australia only represented about 5% of our site rental revenue. So, it would get lost in the rounding trying to back that out and see the benefit of it. The real 40-basis-point move or the vast majority of it is a legitimate increase in the amount of activity that we expect in the calendar year.","As I mentioned in my comments, some of that was achieved during the second quarter and flows through the balance of the year. And then some of it is an increased expectation in leasing. That increase in expectation is largely based on what we're seeing on towers. Where we are on small cells doesn't have that meaningful of an impact on that number. So, the vast majority of what you're seeing there in the uptick of 40 basis points on the growth rate is coming from towers.","David Barden","[Inaudible]","Benjamin Moreland","And I would just add to that, the 10% gross growth we're quite proud of, obviously, that includes the organic growth of leasing and then the escalators on top of that. So, that 10% number, which is consistent for the balance of the year, is something that we think is highly indicative of a pretty robust market.","Dave, to your question about C-RAN, it's very early as we're being told by our customers as we've talked to them about some of these opportunities. But over time, I think the net impact to us as tower owners is that it probably brings some of the smaller sites that have more smaller ground footprint more into play for co-location to the extent they were challenging on a ground footprint, you couldn't add to it because the C-RAN architecture typically locates what we think of as base stations offsite, more like - it frankly looks more like the architecture on a small cell network. It just happens to terminate on a tower. It looks to us like over time we could see less equipment on the ground potentially but not less in the air.","I think you're still going to have active remote radio heads and, potentially, more antennas up the tower as more spectrum is utilized in trying to get maximum spectral efficiency out of their installations. So, I think it's a material architectural evolution that will probably happen over the next decade. But from our take today, it looks like it probably has positive effects on ground space and really doesn't affect what's up the tower. And that's my best view as we sit here today.","David Barden","And, Ben, if I could just follow up. But just in terms of some of the contracts and thinking about kind of bucketing out the revenue contributions. I mean, obviously we're talking something way down the road. But if your average new cell is $2,000 today, and all of a sudden your carrier customers don't need as much ground space, is that a $1,900 contract all of a sudden or is it $2,000 package deal, and you use it how you want to use it.","Benjamin Moreland","Yeah. I think over time, the pricing in our industry has continued to evolve a little bit. But ultimately, it relates to what's the load on the tower, and potentially the shareable economics of the tower are always in play to the benefit of the carriers. Meaning, we as a company take that lease-up risk as you're certainly aware, and we'll make the tower available to them on a very attractive single-digit yield. That's what happened in all of the large sale leasebacks whether the initial yield was sort of in the 4% to 5% range for most of these transactions, and then we lease it up from there.","So my view on that long-term pricing scheme is that no matter how you - what the nomenclature is or how you denominate the pricing, it ultimately is going to go to yield on the asset. And I think we as a company - and I certainly won't speak for my competitors, but we as a company ultimately think about this as a shared model and providing that shareable economic to the carrier customer such that with multiple tenants on a tower, we're going to yield above our cost of capital, above the cost to own and operate that site. And that's going to be the case, no matter how you denominate how we charge for rent.","And so, it's not getting any easier to locate towers that is for certain. And so these assets have a very significant franchise value, and I'm very confident that we'll be able to attract the yield that's above our cost of capital for the foreseeable future just as we've done on the legacy Crown sites that are over 15% per tower on a yield basis with three tenants per tower.","David Barden","Got it. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Colby Synesael at Cowen & Company.","Colby Synesael","Great. Two questions if I may. First one, I just want to get some context on guidance. You mentioned, obviously, that you're expecting $25 million to $30 million in [indiscernible] decomissioning. Can you tell us what was previously assumed in your guidance, I'm not sure if that have been previously disclosed. And then, as it relates to 2016, I'm sure you could appreciate that there's - from an investor perspective, a lot of excitement around what we could see in 2016 in terms of demand relative to 2015, particularly from AT&T and Sprint. I was wondering if you could talk about what you're actually seeing from those two providers as we stand here today in terms of some of the activity and what that might mean for 2016. Thanks.","Jay Brown","Sure. On the first question, Colby, originally, we had expected paying [indiscernible] fees to be about $20 million in the calendar year. So, we've increased the expectation by about $7.5 million. The vast majority of that we got in the second quarter. So, there's a little bit left in the balance of the year but I think we - most of it is - we booked at this point.","Benjamin Moreland","On the 2016 outlook, Colby, I'd sort of reiterate something Jay said earlier but I think it's good for all of us on this call to be reminded. You know, if we saw a 20% or 25% step in the market next year, and that's a big if, not suggesting that's there, but I think that directionally a question, that's $25 million of run rate exit the year or $12.5 million with the midyear convention that go into the numbers.","So, that's something just under 1% change in AFFO per share growth rate. So, I think it's important that we work hard for every percent around here. And so, if it's 6% to 7%, that's been off our long-term forecast for you. If the market were up 20% to 25% in a year, into the second year, you'd see something just over a 1% increase above plan in AFFO.","At the same time, that really demonstrates the resiliency of the model, which is kind of the comments we're making about the dividend yield as we sort of concluded my remarks. I mean, you'd be hard-pressed to find a business that frankly has less volatility with more utility for these assets, your need for these assets over time, and you've got the dividend yield which is obviously made up of contracted revenue. You've got escalators that result in about half of the growth that we're forecasting. And then we work hard every day on that additional 200, 300, 400 basis points of growth above that escalator. And it's frankly one of the great attributes about this business model, is how insensitive it is to changes in this market.","Colby Synesael","And no specific color I guess on increased activity potentially from either AT&T or Sprint at this point?","Jay Brown","I'm not going to let you talk us up here in June or July, whatever it is.","Colby Synesael","Right. Fair enough. Thank you.","Jay Brown","All right. Good luck.","Operator","We'll move next to Jonathan Schildkraut at Evercore ISI.","Jonathan Schildkraut","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I may. First, I noticed that the payout as a percent of AFFO stepped up a little bit in the quarter. And even as I look at, say, the first half of the year, free cash flow relative to dividends, it looks like dividend payments were a little higher than free cash flow. So, I guess the question here is, is the step-up in AFFO payout sort of in the free cash flow relative to dividend somewhat misleading due to timing but also the fact that you're putting out capital and then getting reimbursed from the carriers? And then I like to follow up with a second question, please.","Jay Brown","Yeah. On the first question, Jonathan, I think it's just the - honestly, the timing and the discontinued ops treatment between the sale of Australia and the purchase of Sunesys. So, at this point, all of our historical results, we'd removed Australia from adjusted EBITDA and AFFO as you're pointing out the payout ratio.","As we noted in our remark, Sunesys is the complete push to Australia on an AFFO per share contribution. So, if you were to just factor in Sunesys and the way you - I think you were articulating doing the math. I think if you pro forma Sunesys as though we owned it for all of 2015, then our payout ratio would look the same as it did previously.","I think in and around that payout ratio, it's probably where we're going to manage the business. The way we've articulated that most often to people when asked about our dividend policy, it's to indicate that we would expect to match the growth in AFFO per share with growth in dividend per share. So, in our long-term target of trying to grow AFFO per share of 6% to 7% annually, we would target growing the dividend at 6% to 7% organically over the longer term. So, I think that's the short answer to it. You'll see that payout ratio would be back in line once we close Sunesys would be our expectation.","Jonathan Schildkraut","Great. And then I found it really helpful that you guys provided 14 numbers stripping out CCAL. We can sort of see what the growth rate of the remaining business is. As we come back and we layer in Sunesys whenever that closes and you give us a little bit more detail, I'm just trying to understand if we're going to have a real sense as to what happened from the business from 2015 to 2016 if Sunesys gets rolled in given that you've stripped out sort of the CCAL from 2015 now. It's an asset reallocation, and so understanding what you've done with sort of the capital you've been allocated as we move into 2016 and beyond. It might be helpful to have a sense as to the contribution of the business, at least in terms of what you owned it in the second quarter was from CCAL, any thoughts?","Jay Brown","Yeah. Jonathan, I appreciate the feedback. Obviously, it's a great story on small cells, and if we close that acquisition, we'll be able to help folks understand our numbers and our guidance for the full-year and what we expect the contribution is from the asset once we close and the impact to guidance and try to do it in a similar vein as we try to do our overall disclosure of helping folks understand the business. And one of the reasons why we talked about a longer-term target of AFFO per share growth rate is our aim is for those who are invested in our company to have the same view of growth and the future prospects of the business that we as a management team do. So, our aim in all those disclosure matters is to try to help make the business as clear as we possibly can. We're always open to feedback on that. So, we'll take that away. I appreciate the thoughts on it.","Jonathan Schildkraut","All right. Thanks so much for taking the questions.","Jay Brown","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","We'll go next to Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much. I wanted to follow up on one of the prior questions about carrier strategies around small cells. And it does seem as though there's a lot of interest and activity around sort of the co-location opportunities that you folks are putting forward. But also, are there other initiatives in place in which the carriers are going to wholly own their own small cell deployments and architectures whereby they may not completely embrace the co-location based business model? And then I've got a follow-up from that side.","Benjamin Moreland","Absolutely. You know, it's just like with the tower side. It was only this year that Verizon decided to sell their towers the second time. So, I think it's because of the need for capacity in these markets you're going to see carriers work on self-performing to a degree just like they've done on the tower side where, in various markets, they may be able to access vendor relationships or their own capability to supplement what we as an industry will bring to them.","So, I think it's both, Amir. I don't think it's going to be wholly third-party infrastructure-led. And I think that's fine. I mean, again, it's a big world out there. And it makes sense in terms of speed to market where you've already got fiber to work on that. And that was sort of the nature of our Sunesys interest and NextG three years ago, was when you have fiber in a market that's been purpose-built for small cell deployments, you can get on the air quicker. And that's a key determinant on whether you get the business or not. And somebody that has to start from scratch doesn't really have a competitive advantage. And that brings in the potential for the carrier to work on it themselves. So, I think it's going to be both.","Amir Rozwadowski","That's very helpful, Ben. And then in talking about sort of the current demand environment, you had mentioned that the leasing activity that you had seen has been fairly healthy out of Verizon and T-Mobile. If we start to think about sort of the opportunity set over the next 12 to 24 months, I mean, is there a potential that they are satiated with their current build requirements and sort of tempered back, or do you see the introduction of new spectrum AWS-3 or anything along those lines as continuing to support the healthy demand environment that you've seen out of those carriers?","Benjamin Moreland","We have a very strong view that we're going to continue to see a healthy demand of that environment based upon the different products and services that we, as consumers, are going to be utilizing going forward. And I think the biggest driver of that, as I mentioned in my remarks, is around video and ultimately, live television content. I think that's a huge driver for our business going forward that we just, frankly today, can't really begin to quantify for you. Just sitting here 10 years ago, we wouldn't have been able to quantify sort of the broadband Internet adoption that we're now seeing.","So, I think it's a long runway of growth. Again, in our business, we don't so much look for inflection points as we look for extended runways. And I have a very strong view about an extended runway which is how we got comfortable with sort of giving you a five-year outlook at 6% to 7%, which I would mention, remember 2015, with the headwind of churn being the highest of all the years, is going to be a lot more like 5%. So, in order to say 6% to 7% over five years, obviously, it has to step at some point. And we've given you a little bit of that view towards 2016, and we'll probably leave it at that.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Bowen of Pacific Crest.","Michael Bowen","Okay. Thank you very much. A couple of things here. With regard to the organic growth, I think you've said last quarter that 50% was from the existing book of business. I want to find out if that was still the same. And then secondly, with regard to the small cell business, how do you think about that in relation to the AFFO per share organic growth that you talked about of 6% to 7%? In other words, as you layer that in, what should we think about as far as incremental organic growth from that business? Thanks.","Benjamin Moreland","I think on your first question, the vast majority of the revenue growth that we're seeing in the business is being driven by brand-new leases on existing towers, as well as the small cell revenue. We're seeing a minimal benefit from amendment to existing site. So, currently, most of it is being driven by new leases, and that's driving the organic growth that the revenue line and then obviously flowing down to the AFFO line. In the second part of the question, I think the way I broadly answer the question is as we make investments in the case of the Sunesys acquisition of about $1 billion, that acquisition, we think, has lots of opportunities for growth to the long-term which we've articulated on this call.","When you get down to that as the contribution to the growth on that 6% to 7%, it represents a relatively small percentage of the overall enterprise value. So, we think it's additive. But it's additive in terms of basis points and not multi-percentage points to that 6% to 7%. So, one of the ways that we've thought about is it probably gives us a greater confidence that we have the opportunities to achieve the higher end of our target of 6% to 7%, but didn't necessarily cause us to reevaluate our 6% to 7% target.","And, frankly, as we look at the opportunities that we have in front of us, I'm not sure that there are lot of things that we would say from an investment standpoint would be of a size that would cause us to reconsider that overall target. Most of what we're working on is investing the excess cash flow that we have and opportunities that we see in front of us that makes sense. And we think continue to increase dividends over time. And then lease up the assets that we already own whether that's towers or small cells","Michael Bowen","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, lastly, with regard to that AFFO per share organic long-term target, should we assume that that's with the - relatively static share account or have you made any assumptions that are maybe in the - under the covers there. Thanks.","Jay Brown","Well, I think the way I would answer that question is, obviously, anytime we look at the opportunity to invest in something, it may require that we utilize some amount of equity in order to accomplish that. But to the extent that we were to utilize equity or even debt or cash flow it's only because we think the investment warrants it. It has to increase our overall growth rate and it has to be additive to our ability to pay dividends over the long term as measured by what's the growth in AFFO per share.","So, I'm not going to presume today that we either need or don't need to utilize equity or debt to make growth opportunities. We'll have to look at them as they come and evaluate what we think the growth prospects of those individual transactions are against the cost of the capital.","I would also point out over a long period of time, we've been very diligent about reducing share count. And so, I certainly would not presume today that the opportunity over the next decade may - would not be our opportunity to reduce shares, not just to issue shares. So, we may enter an environment where the best opportunity and the best investment of capital for us, both using cash flow and potentially debt might be reducing our share count. And I certainly wouldn't close off that opportunity.","We're trying to focus on maximizing AFFO per share and maximizing dividends per share over the long term or whether that results in asset acquisitions or the reduction of shares to share purchases, I think we'll try to be smart about what that is and maximize the long-term returns for shareholders.","Michael Bowen","Okay.","Benjamin Moreland","Now I would just point out that as you get to that 5 times target and if we're successful in attracting the rating that we hope on the investment grade side, just to add to the Fitch Rating this quarter, at that point, then your ability to then re-lever EBITDA resumes like we've had for years, that happens to be a 5 multiple, as Jay outlined in his remarks, well, then you're able to reliever EBITDA at 5 times every year, which adds significant capacity once you achieve that level.","Michael Bowen","All right. Very helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","We'll go next to Batya Levi at UBS.","Batya Levi","Thanks. Couple of follow-ups. First, on - as AT&T and Verizon, especially Verizon, begin to reform some of its 850 spectrum for LTE build-outs in early 2016, do you think that kind of activity provides upside to the current trend, or will it be enough to just sustain the level?","And another question on the small cells, I think you've mentioned 2,300 nodes on the pipeline. How quickly that they will be generating revenues? Thank you.","Benjamin Moreland","Yeah. Sure. The AT&T - I mean, sorry, the Verizon amendment activity, as you suggested, I would say that's broadly sort of baked in our view. They're a very, very steady and consistent disciplined investor in their network. And as they've talked about on their call, the reforming of the spectrum is sort of an ongoing way to maximize the efficiency of their investment in spectrum, and that's sort of implicit in our views without being - I'm not sure we're ever 100% accurate - I'm certain we're not - on exactly, by carrier, the nature of the revenue growth we get every year. We do our best to target it in the fall of the prior year. And then we do our best to see how well we predict that outcome. But it's implicit. I wouldn't say that it's additive.","Jay Brown","On your second question, typically, small cell deployments are taking us about 18 months roughly from the time we're awarded to building them, 18 to 24 months. Some portion of that pipeline would represent co-locations on existing systems, and that timeline would be much lower than the 18 to 24 months to build it out. And then the other thing I would point out to you, as we've mentioned in prior quarters, that pipeline is not a static number. So, we're constantly pursuing other opportunities given the returns that we're seeing in that business. And so, as much as we're completing projects that have been in the pipeline for 18 to 24 months, we're filling back up the pipeline with new opportunities that will be building over the next couple of years.","Batya Levi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Spencer Kurn at New Street Research.","Spencer Kurn","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just to follow up on Sunesys, you've identified 3,500 opportunities for small cells on the asset. Can you just provide a bit of context around what that means for the overall lease-up potential you see there, and also how much revenue can you drive off of those opportunities? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Yeah. Those are opportunities that we've identified in our pipeline as opportunities to add nodes to their existing network fiber. The timeline for that, again, I would go back to my prior comment around 18 to 24 months to bring those online once we start working on them. The revenue contribution that we see from nodes is about a third of what we would typically see from a tower tenant. So, if you thought about the 3,300 nodes, those would look like in the neighborhood of about 1,000 new tenants on towers. And each tenant on a tower is in the neighborhood of about $24,000 to $30,000 on an annual basis in terms of rent.","So, the contribution there, probably in the neighborhood - somewhere in the neighborhood of $24 million to $30 million on the revenue line as we build up those nodes. We obviously expect that pipeline to build as we integrate the asset and create more opportunity, but it was obviously helpful as we thought about going into the acquisition on a yield of about 6% roughly day one and then having visibility to what equates to another couple 100 percentage points of yield - basis points of yield as we thought about the asset being able to specifically identify nodes that we thought we're going to end up on that fiber.","Spencer Kurn","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jonathan Atkin at RBC Capital Markets.","Jay Brown","Welcome back, Jonathan.","Jonathan Atkin","So, AWS-3, I just wondered what your - what's the plausible outcome in terms of when that might start to drive some amended revenues? And in your case, you've got some MOAs and it looked like some of your sale leaseback deals, and I wondered whether that perhaps a new tier growth opportunity from AWS-3 but in terms of physical deployment at the site, are there going to be RRUs and is that going to happen second half of next year or first half of next year? What's your sense of that?","Benjamin Moreland","Jon, my sense is you're going to start seeing it second half of next broadly, and it will depend on the portfolio and the configuration whether it was a legacy Crown Tower or whether it was newly acquired. And then at the individual site level, what the capacity - what's currently on the side against the reserve capacity. So, it's very hard to give you an exact number, but I would tell you that across even the AT&T portfolio, we're already seeing additional revenue as we highlighted on this call before. We're already seeing additional revenue on many of those installations as they upgrade through the reserve capacity. So, again, long-term implicit in our view on growth over time, but I can't really be a lot more specific than that.","Jonathan Atkin","Thank you.","Benjamin Moreland","You bet.","Son Nguyen","And with that, I appreciate it and recycling Jon Atkins's background to the beginning, I think we've covered all the bases, covered the waterfront this morning with an 1 hour and 15 minutes. I appreciate everyone's attention. We are going to work hard on delivering the second half of the year like we have the first half. Excited to welcome our Sunesys friends onboard here shortly, and I will talk to you on the next quarter call. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation."],"6110":["Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 26, 2012 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Fiona McKone - Vice President of Finance","Jay A.

Welcome to the Crown Castle International Q2 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today, Thursday, July 26, 2012, at 9:30 a.m. Central time. I'll now turn the conference over to Ms. Fiona McKone, VP, Corporate Finance and IR. Please go ahead.","Fiona McKone","Thanks, Ron. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us as we review our second quarter 2012 results. With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland Crown Castle Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown, Crown Castle Chief Financial Officer. To aid our discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investor section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will discuss throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements and information based on management's current expectations. Although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurances that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.","Information about the potential factors that could affect the company's financial results is available in the press release and in the Risk Factors section of the company's filings with the SEC. Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from those expected.","Our statements are made as of today, July 26, 2012, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","In addition, today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, funds from operations, funds from operations per share, adjusted funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations per share. Tables reconciling such non-GAAP financial measures are available under the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay A. Brown","Thanks, Fiona, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a few summary comments as outlined on Slide 3 and then I'll go through our results and outlook in greater detail. As you see from our press release, we had an excellent second quarter, exceeding the high end of our previously issued guidance for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. We continue to make good progress with the integration of NextG and the WCP assets we acquired earlier this year and are excited by the ongoing deployments of wireless data networks. The strong year-to-date results and our expectations for the second half of the year allow us to meaningfully increase our 2012 outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.","Turning to Slide 4. During the second quarter, we generated site rental revenue of $518 million, up 13% from the second quarter of 2011. New tenant additions increased site rental revenue by 6%, reflecting the increased leasing activity driven by the 4 major carriers upgrading their networks. And the remaining 7% growth came from our 2 recent acquisitions. The contribution to site rental revenues from these acquisitions was approximately $6 million higher in the quarter than we had previously expected. Further, we were able to achieve certain cost synergies related to these acquisitions quicker than we had previously anticipated.","Site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenues less cost of operations, was $386 million, up 15% from the second quarter of 2011. Further, our network services continue to exceed our expectations, reflecting the level of network upgrade activity in the market.","Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2012 was $379 million, up 18% from the second quarter of 2011.","As shown on Slide 5, AFFO was $215 million, up 19% from the second quarter of 2011. And adjusted funds from operations per share was $0.74, up 17% from the second quarter of 2011. Further, while there were no significant nonrecurring items in the second quarter, I would note that we collected approximately $5 million in cash in the second quarter that we had previously expected to collect in the third quarter, which benefited our AFFO results in the second quarter.","Turning to investments and liquidity as shown on Slide 6. During the second quarter, we spent $95 million on capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $29 million on our land lease purchase program. As of today, we own or control for more than 20 years the land beneath towers, representing approximately 77% of our gross margin. We believe this activity is a core competency of Crown Castle and continue to enjoy significant success with this program as evidenced by the fact that today, 39% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own, up from less than 15% in January of 2007. Further, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 32 years. We continue to focus a significant amount of effort and capital on purchasing land beneath our towers and extending our ground leases.","Of the other remaining capital expenditures, we've spent $7 million on the sustaining capital expenditures and $58 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures, the latter consisting of $30 million on existing sites and $28 million on the construction of new sites, primarily distributed antenna system deployments. Further, during the second quarter, we used $51 million of cash to purchase a portion of our 9% senior notes and 7.75% senior secured notes, including make-whole costs at prices we found attractive relative to these bonds' respective call dates.","We ended the second quarter of 2012 with total net debt-to-last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 5.5x and adjusted EBITDA-to-cash interest expense of 3.1x. As you saw in our press release last night, we reached an agreement with T-Mobile USA to extend the remaining term on all 7,300 existing leases to 10 years and granted T-Mobile rights to upgrade certain towers with radio equipment in connection with their network modernization plan. We expect this agreement to contribute approximately $20 million in site rental revenue to our second half 2012 results.","Moving to the outlook for the third quarter and full year 2012 as shown on Slide 7 and 8. We expect site rental revenue of between $530 million and $535 million and adjusted EBITDA of between $387 million and $392 million for the third quarter of 2012.","Turning to our full year 2012 outlook. Based on our year-to-date results and our visibility into near-term leasing activity, we have meaningfully increased our full-year 2012 outlook from what we provided in April, increasing site rental revenue by $43 million, site rental gross margin by $36 million and adjusted EBITDA by $63 million. This increase in our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is driven by a number of factors, including higher run rate site rental revenues than we had previously expected, the benefit from the aforementioned T-Mobile agreement, better-than-expected contribution from our recent acquisitions and the expectation of continued strong performance from our service equipment [ph].","I'm delighted with the performance of our business and our increased expectations for the balance of 2012. We now expect 2012 year-over-year site rental revenue growth of 13%, an adjusted EBITDA growth of 17% and AFFO growth of 16%. We expect to augment our AFFO growth through opportunistic investments and activities such as share purchases, tower acquisitions, new site construction and land purchases. Consistent with our past practice, our outlook does not include the benefit from these expected investments.","As shown on Slide 9, for 2012, we expect to generate approximately $850 million of AFFO and invest approximately $350 million on capital expenditures related to purchases of land beneath our towers, the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites, including distributed antenna systems.","Ignoring our borrowing capacity, the portion of our AFFO after expected capital expenditures represents $125 million per quarter of cash flow that we could invest in activities related to our core business, including purchases of our shares and acquisitions. As such, we remain focused on our investing our cash in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share. I believe that this level of capital investment can add between 4% and 6% to our organic AFFO per share growth rate annually.","In summary, we had an excellent second quarter as we continue to execute around our core business, and we are very excited about the balance of 2012.","With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Thanks, Jay. And thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning.","As Jay just mentioned, we had an excellent second quarter, exceeding the outlook for site rental revenues, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. And we are excited about our business as we look forward to the balance of the year.","As you know, there's a significant amount of activity in our industry currently as all 4 major U.S. wireless carriers are engaged in major network upgrades simultaneously, and we are enjoying unprecedented visibility into future revenue growth as evidenced in our increased guidance. In fact, leasing activity grew 15% in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter last year. The big 4 U.S. carriers accounted for approximately 81% of our growth in the second quarter. And as expected, amendments made up approximately 90% of their activity in the quarter as they continue to focus on upgrading their networks.","Further, as Jay mentioned, we recently reached an agreement with T-Mobile USA to extend the remaining term on all 7,300 existing leases to 10 years and granted T-Mobile rights to upgrade certain towers with radio equipment in connection with their network modernization plan. We're obviously thrilled with our relationship with T-Mobile and look forward to assisting them in building out their network modernization plan. We'll be working very hard to ensure we achieve the operational efficiencies and deployment speed that both parties intended through this agreement.","As the largest single provider of sites to the largest -- to the 4 largest wireless carriers in the U.S., we expect to receive an outsized benefit from the significant 4G upgrade activity from all of the carriers, which we believe is reflected in our current results and updated outlook.","In addition to the continued growth of our site leasing business, I'm very pleased that our services business continues to perform very well, reflecting the significant level of network upgrade activity in the market. This success results from a diligent effort to capture more of the opportunities to assist our customers in all aspects of the installation process on our sites. This increase in services activity is attributable to the confidence our customers have in Crown Castle, as regularly expressed in our customer surveys that consistently rank us as delivering the highest customer satisfaction in the industry. This doesn't just happen by itself, and I want to thank all of our employees for this terrific result.","Further, in the second quarter, we made significant progress with the integration of NextG and the WCP assets acquired earlier this year. The integration of the WCP assets is complete, and the integration of NextG is on track and proceeding very well. I'm pleased that we've been able to retain approximately 75% of the NextG employees and have built a DAS and small-cell solutions organization we think is second to none around these core NextG employees.","While these integration activities are ongoing, the business opportunity continues to grow. And today, we have over 2,000 nodes in the pipeline. The acquisition of NextG positions us as an industry leader in distributed antenna systems and builds on the DAS success we have already enjoyed. We're excited about our future prospects for the combined organization as a market leader in this new extension of our business.","I believe our strategy of focusing on the U.S. market positions us well for the growth I believe lies ahead. The U.S. continues to lead in the deployment of 4G technology with 4G -- with LTE networks well under way and is the largest and fastest-growing market for the mobile Internet. As demand for data services is concentrated in the major cities, we feel we are best positioned to capture this opportunity with the highest concentration of sites and DAS nodes among our peers in the top 100 markets, with 71% of our towers located in the top 100 BTAs, where a significant share of the incremental leasing demand from LTE activity originates. As demonstrated in our current results, I believe our tower portfolio and the ability to execute for customers in the U.S. allows us to capture this activity in the form of site leasing revenue growth as the carriers continue to upgrade and add sites to meet this increase in consumer demand for the mobile Internet.","Importantly, the shared infrastructure model that is the foundation of our business provides the wireless carriers the most cost-effective way to deploy network capacity, thereby allowing them to deploy 4G technology faster and at a lower cost than they otherwise would able to do. Further, as indicated by quarterly surveys from our customers, we continue to deliver the highest customer service in the industry. The combination of our customer-focused approach together with the best assets in the industry allows us to maximize the opportunity in the U.S. market.","In summary, we had a great second quarter. We have made terrific progress in integrating these recent acquisitions, and we are excited about our company's position relative to the significant growth occurring in the U.S. market. Further, as Jay indicated, we remain focused on investing activities that we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share.","With that, operator, I think we are pleased to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Clay Moran from Benchmark Company.","Clayton F. Moran - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, Ben. First off, can you just explain how the straight-line revenue guidance changed from the first quarter to the second quarter? It's up significantly more than the $20 million from T-Mobile. What's driving that?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure, I'll -- I'll let Jay have a crack at that.","Jay A. Brown","Sure. Yes, Clay, thanks for the question. As we -- we've got now basically 2 ways to look at our results. One way is from a traditional GAAP standpoint. So you can look at our results in the top line, site rental revenue growth down through adjusted EBITDA. And then we've also provided the detail reconciling to an AFFO metric, which is more of a cash metric. So you can look at it either way. Specifically, there are basically 2 things that are driving the movements quarter-to-quarter. One of them is the T-Mobile agreement that we talked about, which is an increase in the site rental revenues that we'll see at the GAAP line of about $20 million in the second half of the year. The contribution on the cash side is about $1 million. And as we noted in the press release, those 2 numbers will converge over the next approximately 4 years. The other item relates to the timing on cash collections, and it's a relatively new metric for us. So we may be a tad bit conservative in terms of how we assume cash flows are going to come in over time. We obviously did better than what we expected in the second quarter. We probably, frankly, pulled through in the second quarter some of what we had previously expected to get in the third and fourth quarter. So over time, we'll probably get a little bit better at predicting exactly the timing of those. But it's -- in essence, we've added almost the working capital component to that metric. But pleased about the growth, and I think you can look at it on a year-over-year basis and see that on either way you want to look at it, whether you want to look at it on a more traditional income statement operating results basis or if you'd like to look at it on a cash basis, both of those line items are growing nicely.","Clayton F. Moran - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","And then second thing, can you just remind us about your master lease agreements with the 4 national carriers? Do you have all 4 under MLAs now? And secondly, the -- it sort of contracts out the revenue, can you talk about what percentage of the opportunity you think is recognized by these MLLs (sic) [MLAs] sort of already under contract compared to what you see maybe in your CCI sites analysis? And then secondly, I mean, you have a heavy contracted revenue base now, I assume. Can you talk about what that looks like and what it implies for the cash and GAAP growth rates going forward?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure, Clay. I'll try to take a crack at some of those. First of all, yes, we are pleased that with the signing of the T-Mobile agreement, we now have all 4 major carriers under long-term MLAs related -- and with rights to expand their network and add equipment to our site -- our sites. I haven't seen our draft yet or the Q, but I think with this T-Mobile, we'd still be probably in the range of 9 years average life remaining and probably over $15 billion of committed revenue. Stand by for the Q on that next week. But it's a significant commitment and obviously makes us very comfortable with the long-term predictability of the revenue stream. The other thing you mentioned, though, is around this now, as Jay was talking about, you can pick your GAAP metrics, you can pick your cash metrics, whichever you like. Naturally, when you extend the contract out 10 years,as we have 10 to 12 or 15 years with all the major carriers, there's going to be a significant amount of straight-line impact to that -- so again, for those that may not be as close to it -- revenue recognized before the cash is received, because we're required straight-line that escalation. But when you look at the AFFO number, obviously that's all normalized for that. So if there's a significant amount of this straight-line revenue hung up on the books, then what you can expect is you'll see a significant amount of growth in AFFO as those natural escalators come through over the remaining years. And so I think we can look forward to seeing AFFO just sort of have a natural, built-in, organic growth even before the market growth that we're excited to be seeing out there. And then the last point, around -- I'll try to quantify for you how much of the growth we've already -- we sort of guide in the numbers, I wouldn't be able to do that for you. I am -- we've sort of missed that every time we looked at it, honestly. There's a lot going on that is driven by consumer demand for data services. And that's requiring continued upgrade of sites, expansion of existing -- of original footprints on what the original upgrades were going to look like. And then we fully expect that at some point in the future, we're going to see cell splitting, which will result, we think, in material co-locations around back to your CCI sites analysis on where we believe there our existing towers that can accommodate additional demand where a carrier has a need in a market, particularly around capacity and cell splitting. And that even leaves out the conversation around the whole DAS nodes and the small-cell business that we've made a very large investment in and are very pleased with the prospects there. So we have very high expectations for that business. As we've told you before, we think that could account for 20% to 25% of our growth going forward. And for such a relatively small component of our company today, that's significant outsized growth relative to its size. And so I wouldn't be able to guess for you how much is pre-sold. We are very busy, as you can tell, with the service level of activity. We're going about as fast as we can right now. We're going to add the T-Mobile application volume into the pipeline. Very, very pleased about that. We're going to be adding some resources around that to accommodate that. And so it's a very good time to be working for all 4 carriers as they work to build out their networks.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Barden from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The -- so first thing when I saw the T-Mobile announcement, Ben, is it kind of just said to me that in terms of the risks of consolidation between Sprint and T-Mobile or Sprint and TCS or AT&T and Leap that we've kind of feared about this industry for a really long time, it kind of struck me that maybe we've just de-risked this industry with respect to the consolidation issue for a long time. And I just wanted to sanity check that to make sure that there aren't change-of-control issues or other kinds of contractual wiggles that would make that an overreach in terms of interpretation. I guess -- and then second question I had was just with respect to monetizing the T-Mobile relationship. I guess you've given them rights to certain towers. I guess could you kind of elaborate a little bit on how much room you have to monetize the things that T-Mobile does with the network through time a little bit more clearly? That'd be great.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure. First of all, I think your interpretation is correct. These contracts with all the carriers basically are committed for that primary term and with, as I said, depending on the carrier, 10 years, 12 years or 15 years. And so these are committed contracts that would obviously have to be satisfied in any scenario you can come up with. Secondly, with respect to the T-Mobile agreement, we've disclosed the fact that the agreement gives them rights to modernize and upgrade certain towers. It's less than 100%. But we've been asked not to share any further details because we don't want to get into any of their particular proprietary upgrade plans. And so we're not going to go further in terms of talking about exactly what their plan is and the pace and all of that. I would clarify 1 thing around the $20 million of impact on a revenue basis this year. That is broken out. Roughly about 1\/3 of that is attributable to the straight-line impact of the renewal of the underlying base contracts. And then the other 2\/3 of that $20 million would be attributable to the recognition of the commitment around the amendment activity or the rights to upgrade the towers. So that's for a little further clarification for you all. But beyond that, we're really not going to get into their specific rollout plan and what exact rights they have acquired from us.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And so just to clarify that last point, Ben, that is to say that for the go-forward upgrade of the network, which includes the remote radio head-ins under their architecture plans, you're charging them more money and then your straight lining that increase in the rents and that's 2\/3 of the $20 million?","W. Benjamin Moreland","That's correct. Would you add anything to that, Jay? Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, on T-Mobile, just to follow up, and then a question on Australia. And so can you maybe give us a sense as to what the 2013 annualized AFFO contribution would be from the master lease agreement that you signed with T-Mobile? And does concluding that MLA mean that you're not interested in the potential purchase of their towers?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, Jonathan. On the first question there, I guess the way I would describe it is as we've previously disclosed, in about 4 years, those 2 numbers are going to be approximately equal. I don't think we're going to be so specific about disclosing the contractual terms of that stat [ph]. As we have done with all of the carriers, we've taken a view -- and these are -- these kind of transactions are relatively new to the tower industry. You'll remember historically when carriers would go through the next upgrade cycle, they would typically want to pay us on a one-off basis. And so you would go through -- as we went through each amendment cycle, the carrier would come to us, and we would negotiate on a one-off basis for each individual tower. I think over the years, the carriers have gotten to the place where they believe that there's great value to trying to accomplish those cycles with greater speed and ease. And so over the last several years, as we've done with each of the carriers, we've gone through the process of delineating exactly what kind of equipment do they want to add to the towers, what time line do they want to accomplish that over. And then contractually, we work that through in something that's relatively easy for us to help them move at the pace and speed at which they want to. So I think at the end of the day really, this is going to look like a market value transaction, as the previous ones have that we've done. It's just contractually, we've accomplished it in a way that hopefully makes it a little bit easier for them to deal with us. And some of that, we think financially, the returns have been there and are reflected in our results. And then we think the other benefit of it, as Ben has mentioned, on the speed side, it's reflected in our carrier customer surveys where they believe we've accomplished this in a way that makes it -- makes us easier to do business with. Just trying to make it a little simpler.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Then secondly, Jonathan, your question about a prospective T-Mobile tower sale, honestly I wouldn't have any comment on that at all, honestly.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then Australia slowed down in terms of the leaking [ph] sequentially. I just wondered if you can recap some of the operating factors that are causing that.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, there's nothing hidden there. We've got a lot of going on in Australia. It's just not all in the revenue stream yet. The backlog in the pipeline is building. And we don't give specific guidance on Australia, but I'm very pleased to say that I think you're going to see significant growth, finally, after a pretty good flat spot for the last couple of years. While all the carriers are actively managed -- upgrading their network, there's going to be more spectrum and we are really excited about the prospects for the next 3 years there. It's relatively small, it's about 5% of the total, so we don't spend a lot of time on this call talking about it. We spend a little bit of time working on it, though, and our team down there certainly does. And I think you're going to see, by the time we get to the end of this year, materially higher run rate, and we're really pleased about that.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And finally on DAS, maybe update us on how many nodes you operate and how that business has scaled since you closed on the NextG acquisition. And has the growth been primarily indoor or outdoor?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, probably not going to reconcile each node for you, just give you directionally that the pipeline continues to build. We've spent a lot of time, obviously, on integration activity, getting the folks set up, getting their organizations set up, at the same time managing a significant amount of backlog that NextG brought with them that we had on our side as well. We're seeing good activity, both indoor and outdoor. Everything we had expected in the sort of our underwriting fees is about that investment. It's early days, but it's coming true in terms of the carriers' desire to add small cells as a solution to provide capacity in places where macro tower sites won't suffice. We've taken the market through that in a lot of the detailed discussion we're not going to repeat, but we're very excited about what we see there. And can't stress enough, particularly if they're listening, the talent that we've acquired with NextG, we're thrilled about. And combined with our execution capability and balance sheet, frankly, the ability to fund this going forward, we think we've got a winning team.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Is there significant room to improve on the, I'll call it co-location cycle time? Or have you already -- or had NextG already realized these sorts of improvements over the last several years?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, I think there's -- the real opportunity here is to additional tenants on existing systems, at the same time building more systems. And we're working hard to bring that cycle time down. NextG is -- was the master at speed in terms of building. And the talent that's now resident in our shop around that, we think we've got a really good formula for going fast. Again, it requires a carrier to have a need. And depending on the carrier and the location, that need is in various stages of maturity. But we think it's certainly coming towards us, and I'm really excited about what we see.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.","Richard Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Richard Choe for Phil. Just wanted to ask what the level of activity was outside of the big 4 in the quarter. And are you expecting any kind of pickup, and is that in the guidance?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, Richard, as I mentioned, about 80% or so of our activity were the big 4. So that leaves 20% for the rest. And it's pretty steady with what we saw last year. I mean, it's not huge, but it's -- there's some work going on. And I wouldn't get into it to reconcile it customer by customer. The big 4 represent about 80% of our activity right now, but there certainly is work going on at the Clearwire level, Metro PCS and Leap. So I wouldn't diminish that in any way, shape or form. They certainly rely on us and we rely on them for accomplishing their network objectives.","Richard Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And with the strong network services revenue, is that coming from one carrier or multiple carriers? Can you give us a little color on that and how it should trend for maybe the third quarter and the rest of the year?","W. Benjamin Moreland","It's a good, broad-based mix across really all the carriers. As you can imagine, we're very busy on Sprint Network Vision right now. We anticipate moving forward with T-Mobile as that application volume starts to load up now that we've got this agreement signed. We've been very active and pleased with the relationships with Verizon and AT&T. So given the visibility we have evidenced by the guidance we've put out and the implied network services business growth and the EBITDA guidance for the balance of the year, we feel pretty good about the visibility for the second half of this year and, frankly, on into next year. We'll just -- we'll have to see. As we all know, if you're a history -- student of history in this business, you know that can be volatile sometimes. And so we're always a little bit careful about how we forecast that. But given the activity in the market right now, we're sort of in unprecedented times with the activity and the opportunity on the services side.","Jay A. Brown","Richard, specifically in the outlook, we've assumed in the third quarter that we get a contribution from the services business very similar to what we had in the second quarter. And then in the fourth quarter, the contribution from services is expected to be down about $5 million. And as Ben mentioned, as we get further away from the data which we are at currently in predicting that sort of margin, it becomes more difficult to predict exactly where it's going to be. So we're -- we'll generally haircut current levels as we go out further. So fourth quarter is a step down from Q3; Q3 about the same with Q2.","Richard Choe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And for the last question, you talked about the 2,000-node pipeline. What is the timing of -- that we can see that coming online? And when might it make a noticeable impact? Are we talking much further out or something more near term as -- now that things start to ramp back up.","Jay A. Brown","Typically, that pipeline will look like between 18 and 24 months. And obviously, there's nodes coming online every day. And then we're continuing to build the pipeline. When we bought NextG, the pipeline was right around 500 nodes. We've put a number on air and have continued to build the pipeline. But I would say generally, we've got about 18 to 24 months in that pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Ratcliffe from Barclays.","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two if I could. First of all, you highlighted NextG and WCP synergies. Should we look at it as a change in the trend line of EBITDA that you think you get out of those businesses going forward or more of a timing to capture of the synergies? And secondly, could you update us regarding land assets for the towers that are on leased land, what the mix of owners of those land pieces are and what level of concentration there is.","Jay A. Brown","Sure. James, on your first question around synergy, yes, it's bringing forward synergies that we had previously thought would take us longer to accomplish. On a run rate basis, we've now got about $200 million a quarter related to the acquisitions that we've put in. When we underwrote the transaction, we had assumed it would take us much longer than that to accomplish it. As Ben mentioned, we brought across 75% of the employees. So a lot of that synergies that we have achieved is frankly  non-people-related costs. And there are -- there may be still some additional synergies here, but we certainly didn't do this transaction for synergies. So I wouldn't want to hold out hope that there's a lot more synergies to come. Most of this is really around the activity and opportunity that we see in the DAS business. Your second question, around -- yes, well, I appreciate you noticed. We continue to work very hard on that front and find -- and have found a great deal of success. We started this program very early in the industry. And so as we look at the number of sites that are in the hands of third-party acquirers of ground leases, it's a very, very small number. The vast majority of our sites, to the extent that they're still on leased land, is 60% that are on leased land. Those sites would almost entirely be outside the hands of third-party acquirers of ground leases. So we're typically dealing with an individual who just controls 1 or 2 sites. So there's just a very small number of sites in concentrated hands.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss from Raymond James.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, back to the T-Mobile MLA. It looks like the T-Mobile is maybe more reminiscent of the AT&T transaction than the Sprint MLA from the standpoint of you've done the step function up for T-Mobile NT it appears, whereas the Sprint one was more touch it as you go. Is that the correct way of thinking of it?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, I think it is. I mean, I think it's exactly how Jay was describing it. And we find a lot of value, and our customers do, in simplicity. And so if we can contract upfront for basically what the payment, what the value of that amendment is going to be, then it removes sort of all of the paperwork just in pricing individual sites. They know what they have. They can -- we can both go as fast as we possibly can and not get tripped up with paperwork in the interim on pricing individual sites. So it provides certainty in -- of pricing to them, and then the requirement for us is we have to book it, obviously, if it's a commitment. But for everyone's benefit, again, you've got full disclosure. There's the GAAP numbers, if you like, or there's the cash numbers, if you like. So you can look at revenue and EBITDA, all of which will eventually turn to cash. Or you can look at AFFO, which would be the natural growth through those payments. Whether they're structured as actual fees for sites as they come on board, or whether they're embedded in the escalator just a gross step escalator, it frankly doesn't matter. You're going to see it in the very same way. It's going to be a contribution to AFFO over time.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Good. And then maybe looking at that certain towers again. So they've committed to all 7,300 sites, but the radio modernization site is only on certain sites. I know you said you can't really get into a lot of specifics because T-Mobile doesn't want you to. Maybe look at it this way. T-Mobile has said publicly they want to touch 37,000 of their 50,000-or-so cell sites in this phase in '12 and '13. Does your certain number include all of those that are in their 37,000 or just a certain subset of that? Just I'm not trying to put a number into it but just trying to understand. . .","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, I understand, Rick. I understand. And we're not able to give you that detail. And so there's a little bit of a question for all of you as to, well, is there any upside beyond what we've just reported. And I would argue that that'll depend on T-Mobile's success and their own deployment plans, and we'll just have to wait and see. But I would ask you to respect their confidence, and they've asked us to keep it between us what their deployment plans are. And so that -- those questions are probably better directed towards them.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Sure. No, it doesn't hurt asking.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The final question for me is, Jay, you mentioned how you have kind of $120 million per quarter available cash to use for the buyback, M&A, site building, land, et cetera. As you think about potential transactions out there, does that then limit you to $250 million or so in the second half of the year? Where would you take leverage for the right transaction? I'm just trying to understand kind of where you see the balance sheet versus the potential use of funds.","Jay A. Brown","Sure. No, it's definitely not a limitation, the $125 million a quarter. I think it's just the -- think of it as a baseline for the amount that we would expect to spend around the acquisitions or share purchases or, frankly, maybe increasing CapEx around distributed antenna systems or other areas. As we think about the capacity that we've built into the balance sheet, and we've historically talked about a target level of leverage as somewhere between 4 to 6x debt-to-EBITDA, we're now in a position of basically approaching kind of the midpoint there. So we have some capacity that we could use to -- on a transaction that we thought was attractive. And each of the things that we look at, whether it's share purchases or tower acquisition, they go through the same filter. And the first filter is around weighing the various merits of alternatives. And any acquisition that we would look at has to pass the test of showing more accretion than we could have otherwise achieved by buying back our own towers via share purchases. And once we get past that measure, then it comes down to a question of how do we want to finance that particular activity, whether it's share purchase or -- share purchases or tower acquisitions. And as we've said over time, depending on what the returns are, there's a possibility that we may go a little bit outside of that targeted level of leverage for the right opportunity.","W. Benjamin Moreland","As we did with NextG.","Jay A. Brown","As we did with NextG, the -- and WCP, which we financed both of those with debt and cash flow as long as we have a path towards quickly getting back inside that targeted level of leverage. So I think certainly, we're not going back to the early days of the tower industry and wouldn't expect to see us go much beyond -- from a covenant standpoint, I should say, we can't go outside of 7x debt-to-EBITDA. So there's sort of a cap there on how far outside of the target level of range could we go for any particular activity. But we'd be willing to go above that targeted level of leverage for the right opportunity but have historically tried to manage the business inside that targeted level of leverage.","W. Benjamin Moreland","I think that also, that goes back to the previous conversation about the contracted revenue stream we have. When you start thinking about leverage with 9-plus years of contracted revenue, it makes you a little more comfortable with leverage, particularly given the cost to leverage that.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And the cost of debt is still staying pretty attractive out there?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, I think if we were to finance today in the high-yield space, it would start with a 5, and we'd been somewhere in the 5s today. The bank market continues to be pretty healthy. I think we have a number of opportunities. The structured loan market is attractive. I think we have a number of different markets where we could go and finance ourselves.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","When you put out guidance for this year, you did talk about some churn coming through, I think, primarily from Alltel. Perhaps can you just update us on what was the impact in the quarter. Is that all pretty much done with at this point? And I think you also suggested that there will be limited upgrade activity or renewal activity versus some prior years. Obviously, you've got this big T-Mobile contract, but perhaps give us again, midway through the year, how that's all playing out versus your expectations.","Jay A. Brown","Sure. In the first half of the year -- and we mentioned this in the last quarter call. In the first quarter, churn was lower than what we had previously expected. And in the second quarter, churn came in lower than what we had expected. So we did a little better in the first half of the year than what we had expected. Our outlook for the full year assumed that about 20% of the churn we would see in 2012 would occur in the first 6 months of the year and 30% in the back half of the year. We've not changed our assumptions for the churn in the back half of the year. So I think for the full year, if you were trying to reconcile to our prior comments that we made going into the year, we would expect churn to be better than what we had previously expected.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And is that because the -- whoever -- they're being advised or whatever, they have decided just to keep those sites for their own use or...","Jay A. Brown","Well, what I would tell you is across the board, that happens. We go into any given year, and we have -- similar to the leasing side, we -- we're only going to have about 3 to 6 months' worth of visibility around how carriers are thinking about leases as they come up for renewal. And as they come up for renewal, we'll start to try to estimate what it's going to look like. Sometimes, they tell us. And again, we probably had a situation in the first half of the year similar to what we've seen over time. And that is while they may talk about taking down sites. Ultimately, they take down a few less than what they maybe had originally had planned or articulated. And I think the same thing happened to us in the first 6 months of the year. And we'll just -- we'll update you as we go, but I think back half of the year has a lighter impact from churn. The second part of your question, in terms of what do we expect to see in the second half of the year, no, I don't think there are any large renewals to be accounted for in the outlook certainly beyond what we've talked about or alluded to and don't think we'll have any, at least that we know of or planned, items that would move the numbers other than the typical organic activity that we would see in the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Deutsche Bank.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just to clarify one last point here on guidance, we've been speculating before about the potential impact of T-Mobile's LTE upgrade. As a result of the MLA, that is in your guidance now for the second half of the year, correct?","Jay A. Brown","Right, that's correct, yes.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And based on the way it's structured, it seems like it's somewhat irrelevant how quickly they move through the balance of 2012. You've pretty much have locked in what you're going to get paid?","Jay A. Brown","That's correct.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Right, committed.","Jay A. Brown","That's correct.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just to follow up on the question I had, I think, on your last call when I asked about NextG, now that you've had the sort of operations under your control for a while and you have a much bigger funnel here of nodes, have you started to reassess the way the contracts are written? For example, are you starting to become more of a capital provider around the build-out and, therefore, taking in higher recurring fees? Because that's really the opposite of the way NextG had built its business as an independent company.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, I'd say directionally, Brett, that's going to happen over time. It's not dramatic. And again, you probably wouldn't see that in our reported results anyway because it's all revenue. Whether they make a contribution upfront or they put it all in rent, that's all revenue to us that runs through the P&L. So you probably wouldn't be able to detect that from the statements. But I am going to confirm to you that I think over time, you'll see that move more towards a rent model, less towards a capital-upfront model. I wouldn't -- I don't know how fast it's going to move. But I would emphasize also that we think the shared economics of the tower model absolutely are in play in the DAS model. And so the whole attractiveness of a third-party independent owner like ourselves being involved is that we can effectively share the economics among multiple carriers, exactly the way we do with the tower model. And that becomes very compelling. Particularly when you stack against -- on top of the economics the difficulty of siting, of getting systems built, installing the fiber, and the value of the pole attachments and everything once you have that system built, that's a very valuable asset. And then to the extent you can make that very attractive from a perspective of economics, that it's ultimately the shared model, we think is very compelling and drives co-location in a very significant way, as well as new node opportunities, which we're seeing no shortage of right now.","Jay A. Brown","Brett, I think your question last quarter, if I remember it correctly, was around how have things changed in the DAS space. And in the early days of these distributed antenna businesses, they were either funded by private equity or very, very lowly capitalized firms, and they were trying to build these systems with basically 0 cash out-of-pocket from the firms building the systems. And we are obviously willing to put capital at risk in order to drive and think about the business on a longer-term basis. So today, when we're building the systems, we're putting real capital at risk beyond any capital that would be received from carriers associated with building those systems. Then -- and then our returns are accomplished by making these multi-tenant systems rather than in the early days with a lot of these distributed antenna systems businesses where they were trying to basically make a return with a single carrier and get all of their capital back they won. We've taken a very different approach. And I think generally, across-the-board in the industry, it's become -- it's starting to look more and more like the tower industry. I think we think over time that will continue to happen with the one caveat, as we've -- I think I mentioned last time to you: some of this business is driven by what venue are you putting the activity into. And so there are certain venues and locations where the upfront amounts become far more important to a venue or to a -- to the provider of the space than ongoing rents. And so we will structure the receipts of cash with carriers more commensurate with what the underlying venue or owner desires. But generally, as Ben said, we are generally moving towards the traditional tower model where we put real capital at risk and our returns are achieved by sharing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin from Credit Suisse.","Jonathan Chaplin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So 2 quick clarifying questions. First, on the accounting for the T-Mobile transaction. It looks like about 100% of the revenue in 2012 is noncash. So does that mean that it all gets booked as escalators? And then my second question was again on the 2,000 nodes. Could you give us just a rough sense? I'm assuming that those aren't in guidance. Can you give us a rough sense for, assuming those come on, what 2,000 nodes would generate in incremental revenue and EBITDA?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, in your first question, I think the way I would describe it is the uplift to revenues is an indication of what will ultimately be collected in cash in future periods. And so, in a simple example, Jonathan, if the carrier were going to pay us $100 in year 1 and $105 in year 2, then on the GAAP revenue lines, we would record $102.5 in each of those 2 years. So in the first year, there would be $2.50 of, if you thought about it this way, noncash revenues. And in the second period, your cash receipts of $105 would be greater than the GAAP revenue line. So you would have in essence $5 of cash and $2.5 more of cash than you did showing up in the GAAP statement. So that's what we're saying. And by telling you that it takes about 4 years or so until those numbers get back, then you have some estimation of how long that's going to take. Frankly, on the backside of it, you're in the reverse position. So in the second half of the agreement, in the years beyond 4 years, what will happen is your cash receipts will be greater than that recognized on the income statement. So I think over time, you -- and I think it's always helpful to look at more than one metric. But over time, I think people can look at, either just looking at the operating results and those top line growth, or if you want to look at it on an AFFO basis, then that removes that noise of whether or not it's GAAP reported revenues or cash receipts. You can just look at the cash. And generally speaking, based on the way revenues are recorded in the industry, those cash numbers are going to show slightly higher growth rates than on the GAAP reported numbers. And that's just a function of those, as I gave you the simple example, of seeing the continual benefit of the step-ups in escalations over time. And that'll fall all the way through to the AFFO line.","Jonathan Chaplin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just to follow up quickly on that Jay, these -- sorry -- I get how the straight-lining works. But it seems like 1\/3 of the increase in revenue was from an extension which I would have expected to show up in the straight-lining impact, and then 2\/3 of it is from amendments, which I wouldn't have thought there'd be -- I would have thought there'd be -- roughly 2\/3 of the increase in revenue would show up as an increase in cash as well. So I'm just wondering how the amendment piece is being accounted for, whether it just...","Jay A. Brown","Sure. We do it the same way. So the way you would think about this when you start to talk about the timing of cash payments, the goal of these transactions from the carrier standpoint was to accomplish speed and ease, and we shared that goal. So if you were to think about it in a more normalized sense, obviously no carrier is going to go and put all of that equipment up on the first day. And so what the goal is to match the timing of cash receipts, similar to the activity that we would expect over time. And so that's the way each of these agreements with the carriers have been structured. And so that's why it's not -- in your simple example there, it's not -- that's why it's not 2\/3 cash day 1. Obviously, the space has not been utilized day 1, so the agreements are structured to reflect more of the activity and the real activity on the sites rather than structuring them as a prepayment for that.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, more closely is when those sites would actually come on the air. But whether it's embedded in the escalator or actually could be denominated as just a fixed fee on a takedown schedule of sites, what results in the commitment -- when it's a commitment, then we are required to then go ahead and book the revenue on a straight-line basis. And so it's really irrelevant whether it's baked into the escalator or just a schedule of fixed payments based upon a takedown schedule commitment on sites. We've done it both ways, by the way, depending on the carrier. And either way, we're required to book that revenue upfront. And then the cash would more likely -- more appropriately track as those sites are designed to come on the air.","Operator","Your next question comes from...","W. Benjamin Moreland","Well, one more -- you had -- I'm sorry, Jonathan, you had one more little nib [ph] there on the 2,000 nodes. Let me -- without reconciling that particular set of 2,000 nodes, let me just remind everybody that I think a good thumbnail, and that's what it is, thumbnail, is about 3 nodes to 1 full co-location. We've said that before to you. So call it 650 leases if you were to think about it that way. I'm not, again, reconciling these 2,000 nodes. There could be some higher or lower than that. But generally, that's a pretty good rule of thumb.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong from Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. Jay, you gave some good detail earlier on the implied incrementally the DAS contribution from the services business. I'm wondering if we can take it down to the AFFO level to just understand the impact of the $25 million increase in guidance for the year, how would that split between services versus site rental. And then Ben, you talked about the land aggregators earlier. Obviously, we saw a number of deals for aggregators back at the last year, beginning of this year. I guess the question from my side would be, are you still facing the same competition for individual land plots? It would indicate that the aggregators are still there. They may be smaller, but they're still competitive and they're starting to build portfolios again. Or have we seen them just back off in general as competitors?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Jay?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, Jason, on your first question, I would tell you typically, while not get getting into a greater amount of detail, but typically, services, we would expect that contribution on the income statement to flow through to the AFFO line in about the same period in which it's received. So if you want to take -- if you're trying to reconcile either by quarter or by year, you can basically assume those amounts fall down to the AFFO line. And we obviously think about it on a more consolidated basis. So as we're figuring out those numbers, we may have haircut here or there, some of that impact. So it may not tie exactly. But generally speaking, that's what I would assume.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Secondly, on your PEP -- on the -- we use the term PEP for portfolio extension program. Sorry for the acronym. But with respect to the aggregators that are out there, they're still in the market, and they're still competitive. And we're losing very, very few sites. We're very aggressive in the market. When we need to, we will win. That's sort of become our practice. The way we think about buying land today, we have about 60% of our portfolio financed in an off-balance sheet vehicle with landowners. And so when we looked at buying the property, again assuming that we have confidence in the tower, which we typically do -- there'll be a few exceptions but, generally, we like our sites. When we look at buying our sites, we're thinking about refinancing debt because it's otherwise off-balance sheet. And so that typically is a lower-equity return on an aggregator whose out there to make a private equity-type return. And so it's not very hard for us to win. And given our relationships with our landlord and the fact that we've been at this for about 6 years, we've got good -- very good relationships with landlords. They certainly know  to call us, and you're seeing that in our results. And so I'd say we're losing -- it's just a trickle. I mean, every now and then, it happens but very rarely.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore Partners.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two questions, if I may. First, in terms of the outperformance in the quarter, that $6 million that you attributed to DAS and WCP, can you give a little more color on how that broke out between the 2? And then how should we think about the WCP platform going forward? Is this an area that you're going to continue to invest in? That is, land leases in general or ground leases in general that might reach beyond your portfolio? And then I guess my second line of questions would be around some of the stuff coming out of Washington D.C. Two areas. First, we're hearing a lot about potential spectrum sharing. And I'd be really interesting to hear how you think about spectrum sharing versus the introduction of new spectrum into the marketplace and the potential impact on the towers.","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On the first question, the outperformance, I think the main goal -- and you've followed us for long enough to know that we really don't like to get down into the subunits and start reconciling quarter-to-quarter movements. But I thought it was important in this case because really, this is the first quarter in which we operated these acquisitions, and I think it more speaks to us just being relatively conservative in terms of how we thought the revenues and adjusted EBITDA were ultimately going to come through on those 2 acquisitions as we underwrote them. They're more heavily weighted in terms of the benefit that we got. They're more heavily weighted towards NextG, both in terms of the revenue benefit that's flowing  through as well as the synergies. But I think you now have kind of the baseline for those 2 acquisitions. And with regards to WCP and the benefit there, we acquired a number of rooftops associates with that. We believe, as we've talked about and highlighted as the movements of the carriers moves more and more towards the mobile Internet and providing high-speed data networks in densely populated areas, in areas where, frankly, there are no towers, these rooftops become an opportunity. So we think we may see some opportunities there in the rooftop space. Most of what we underwrote, though, frankly, was in annuity and looking at the escalators underneath ground leases. So I think if you were to look at the growth profile, that's probably a little bit lower than traditional towers and certainly much lower than what we would expect in the DAS business. But we do think there is an upside around the rooftop portfolio.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, and we've already seen some co-location that results in revenue share for us that wasn't underwritten earlier on. So that's been early days, encouraging. And then the -- your last question, Jonathan, around spectrum sharing, let me kind of go back over a little history with everybody. We are a big advocate of anything that basically gets more network and more carriers on the air in the most efficient way. And our best example of that, although it was a trial and hasn't amounted to anything really anything so far because of other issues, was Sprint's attempt to network share elements and spectrum with LightSquared. And we were very supportive of that undertaking. We came to an agreement that we think was effective for all parties. It provided additional compensation for us, but, at the same time, provided LightSquared an opportunity that was significantly more attractive than trying to build out on their own. And we would be a big supporter and advocate of that going forward, and we'd do whatever we could to help someone who had spectrum and wanted to share it with an incumbent going forward. So you might look for more of that in the future, and we'd be a big supporter of that.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, Ben, I guess I was thinking about spectrum sharing more of between the government and the commercial entities. And that's kind of what the FCC has been talking about. And I guess I have a hard time visualizing how that would happen from an equipment perspective and understanding the potential benefit to the tower operator, and I was hoping you might delve into that.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Not into specific detail. I guess one of the key tenets of the business is that we do restrict our customers to only transmitting spectrum that they own or control. And so we're not going to put a customer in business to compete with us around these towers that we own. That said, again previous comments and experience, we're very accommodating and recognize the efficiency in play when people can share. And we are an advocate of getting more spectrum on the air and more entrants in the market in the most efficient way possible. And sharing not only the network but, obviously, the common elements of the infrastructure like the towers and the ground make perfect sense. And so where we can do that, where -- it's reflective in light loading on the tower, and it's literally just spectrum sharing. We can price it accordingly, and we've got a history of doing that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up to my T-Mobile questioning, which is -- and forgive me if you've said this earlier, but have you characterized what the remaining lease term on average was for T-Mobile prior to them signing the extension to 10 years? And then secondly, if you could talk a little bit more about the components of revenue growth within the second quarter. So I think site rental revenue was up something like 13% year-over-year, and maybe you could break that down to what was internal growth versus external acquisitions and then maybe throwing in escalators or churn. Whatever specificity you could give there would be fantastic.","Jay A. Brown","Sure, Michael. On the first question, T-Mobile's maturity was about 4 to 5 years previously. So we extended that from 4 to 5 years to about 10 years. Now keep in mind, when we -- when I say that, it's an average of 4 to 5 years. So what happened with the portfolio is they basically all moved out 10 years from now to a date in the future. And currently, they could have had anywhere from 1 month to 7 to 8 years remaining on the lease. So it was a mix previously and then moving all of those leases out to a future date. But on average, I think the number is right around 4 to 5 years. The second part of your question, around revenue, we grew revenue, site rental revenue, 13%. And the components of that, about 6% of that would be organic growth. You could think of that similar to a same-tower sales-type number. And 7% was coming from the acquisitions that we've done. The -- as we talked about in the previous quarters, we expected churn to be a little bit higher in the first 2 quarters of 2012 than what is typical. And so the growth in escalations was offset with that churn. So really, there's 2 components that drive the revenue growth. And typically, over the last several years, with regards to the organic revenue growth or same-tower sales growth, if you want to think about it that way, that number has been running in the 4% to 5% range. So we're running at a level today that's about 20% above the last couple of years, roughly, just to give you some sort of gauge as to how has the business done. And the majority of that 6% growth is coming from amendments to existing sites as the carriers deploy the next-generation technologies.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And if I could just follow up. When you think about structuring leasing deals and then the deals with your customers, there's obviously a different thing that you want versus like a T-Mobile in this situation. Do they look at the lease extension as a way of paying you more money over time but limiting their upfront cash costs? Or did you want to insist on that longer duration to give you more visibility into revenue from this customer given just all the different things that could happen in the industry over the next number of years?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, Mike, there's an operational reality there. I would ask everyone to think about it. And that is that when the carrier goes in and puts those -- that significant amount of capital in that network, they want price certainty. And so we'll go in. And typically, the conversation goes pretty easily around, \"Let's go ahead and get price certainty on a brand-new term, call it 10 years in this most recent case,\" which gives them price certainty on how this ultimately is going to happen with the additional equipment. So the -- I wouldn't really be able to split out for you what's the conversation about the renewal and what's the conversation about the amendment. They certainly go together. But they're symbiotic because, frankly, they want the price certainty for that longer period to amortize their new investment in the network.","Jay A. Brown","Well, I think in general, as we would look at each of these transactions, we would place a very low value on just the pure extension by itself. I mean, we've never set out with the aim of trading away value and run rate to get an extension because we frankly, as you -- as we have found, we went through the whole renewal cycle with now all of the -- virtually all of the major carriers, which makes up 75% of the revenues in the business almost, and we went through the first 10 years of the industry, came up to those renewal periods and have now extended them. And the thesis in the business was that these were -- this was critical infrastructure that they need and, as Ben said, they've made a significant amount of capital investment in. So we never believed that as we got towards renewal periods, that there was really any necessity to trade away value and haven't done so in any of the agreements. The upside here is really related to whether or not the carriers wanted to make a commitment and be certain about the activity that they were going to put on the sites or not. And then the rest of the movement in revenues has just been the natural effect of moving from the backside of having more cash than the revenues we were recording to now being on this side of it where the revenues all take a big step and now will grow back into that and, over the next several years, move back to kind of the midpoint and then on the backside of the contracts.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then one last question, if I could. Just if you look out over the long term, I think that you guys have some sale-leaseback deals where at the end of that, there was a buyout to the carrier. What's the totality of that future buyout if you aggregate all the agreements you've done through the years? And how many years off is that when we're thinking in terms of present value implications?","Jay A. Brown","I think the only one that -- and I'm not sure entirely what you mean. If you mean can someone buy out the rent, the future rent payments for us, typically, those do not exist. We've talked about the only contract that I can think of that might have some runoff of revenues in the future would be around Sprint's iDEN that were -- that would have been the legacy Nextel. And as we talked about when we did the Sprint agreement, we gave them certain flexibility and certain rights to be able to take off the air sites in -- around the range of 2014 and '15. And we've said that's sort of 2% to 3% of consolidated revenues if they were to go down that path and decommission those sites. But other than that, there's not really buyout-type provisions where folks can walk away from leases that they've committed to. I'm assuming that's what you're driving at.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No. What I was actually thinking through was -- and I thought it was with Sprint, speaking of...?","Jay A. Brown","Right. And I would like...","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, Mike, I think -- yes, let me take a quick crack at it. And it's in the K. So you can pull up the K if you want. But it's -- the Sprint portfolio that we acquired through Global Signal, as I recall, it was a prepaid lease structure which has been used in the industry many times. And I believe the original term was 32 years. Today it would be about 6 off of that, probably so about 26 years remaining, give or take. And the present value of that buyout, Jay, do you have a...","Jay A. Brown","It's about $400 million.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Give or take. It's in the Q. About 26 years out.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Perfect. Yes, that was...","W. Benjamin Moreland","26 years out.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Are there -- and so that's what I was curious about. Are there others that we should be aggregating on top of Sprint? Or is Sprint the only one that we should be aggregating?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Well, technically, BellSouth was the same way. It was 99 years. So I guess we're at 89 -- we're at about 89 years left, just to be complete.","Operator","Your next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the straight line. I believe you increased the midpoint of the guidance coming from straight-line revenue by $50 million, and about $20 million is from T-Mo. Can you talk about where the remainder is coming from? And maybe just a second question on fiber tower. I believe you wrote down most of your investment there. But is there anything that you're carrying on the balance sheet that you need to write down?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On the second question, there's nothing left on our fiber tower investment. We've written all of that down. On your first question, we increased revenue guidance by about $43 million. Of that, about $20 million of that related to the agreement with T-Mobile that we talked about. And the balance of it would come from a combination of where we thought the run rate was in the second quarter going into the back half of the year, where we thought leasing is in the core business and then the comments that I made earlier around how our acquisition, our 2 acquisitions, WCP and NextG, had performed out of the gate. And so those run rates were higher than what we had previously underwritten in the acquisition model and then also, on a run rate basis coming into the business, higher than what we had put into our previous outlook. Those 2 things, combination of about $12 million to $13 million from the acquisition, $6 million actually in the second quarter, that's about $18 million. And then the $20 million from the T-Mobile gives you most of the way towards the uplift in revenue, and the rest of it would be basically where the run rate was in the base business pre-acquisition.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to clarify, my question was more about the increase in the straight-line revenue. I think that went up by about $50 million versus your prior guidance. And about $20 million of that is T-Mo. I was wondering why you think that a straight-line component would be a bit more -- $30 million more than what you originally expected.","Jay A. Brown","Yes, that probably goes to my comments around our conservatism around the timing of cash collections. We obviously did much better in the second quarter than what we had provided in the outlook going into the second quarter. And so that's more of a working -- it's almost, in essence, a working capital measure. And we've probably been a bit conservative as we think about the back half of the year. But $20 million of it is -- would relate to T-Mobile and the balance -- we'll just kind of see how the year goes and see where ultimately cash comes out.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure. Let me wrap up. I thought everybody has been very patient with us while we went through all the questions. Thanks for your time this morning.","Just to wrap up. Strategically, look, it's very important to take a step back and look at where we sit in this industry and with our business in particular. We're in the middle of an unprecedented wave of build-out as the carriers are all making very profitable investments as you look at their current results, the profitable investments to add broadband Internet capacity through 4G services into these networks. We're able to do that in a very efficient way. It's something we're very pleased about. And we're going to work very hard to drive AFFO per share growth into the high teens for the full year this year. That's not quite guidance, but you know we always have stretched goals around here and off of the big base, the bigger base every year that we drive. If we can get into the mid to high teens, maybe even get lucky and get 20% one day, sort of an outsized goal I have, we would be thrilled to death. So we're very pleased with what we see. We're working very hard and look forward to visiting with you on the call next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today.

Welcome to the Crown Castle International Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the presentation over to Son Nguyen, Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, Mr. Nguyen.","Son Nguyen","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our first quarter 2014 results. With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.","To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.","The conference call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected.","Information about potential factors, which could affect our results, is available in the press release and Risk Factors sections of our company's SEC filings.","Our statements are made as of today, April 24, 2014, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","In addition, today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling such non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package and slide presentation posted in the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay A. Brown","Thanks, Son, and good morning, everyone. We executed another great quarter in Q1 2014, exceeding the high end of our previously issued outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.","As you can see on Slide 3, the strong results from site rental and network services, coupled with our recent financing activities, allow us to increase our outlook for full year 2014. In addition to achieving great results in Q1, we had a very productive quarter on many other fronts. First, at the beginning of the year, we achieved a significant milestone as we began operating as a REIT, and subsequently paid our first common stock dividend in March. Further, since the beginning of the year, we have refinanced $2.6 billion of debt, extending our average debt maturity and lowering our overall cost of debt.","Also during the quarter, we made significant progress integrating the AT&T towers, the integration of which we expect to be substantially complete by the fall of this year.","Turning to Slide 4. During the first quarter, site rental revenue increased from $615 million to $747 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 21%. On an organic basis, before nonrenewals and adjusting for the impact of acquisitions, FX, material onetime items and straight-line accounting, site rental revenues increased by $47 million, an increase of approximately 8% compared to the same period a year ago. Excluded from the organic growth rate is the onetime benefit of $5 million from a customer contract termination payment from Revol Wireless during the quarter. The contract related to site leases for Revol, a regional carrier in Ohio that ceased operations earlier this year. Revol previously generated annual site rental revenue of approximately $4 million. Excluding the benefit of this onetime item, we were at the high end of our Q1 outlook for site rental revenues.","Of our approximately 8% organic growth, the cash escalations in our customer contracts contributed approximately 3%, and new leasing activity contributed approximately 5%. This new leasing activity was driven almost entirely by the Big 4 wireless carriers, with 85% of the growth coming from new tenant installations and the remaining portion from amendments to existing tenants.","As a part of the new leasing activity, we are continuing to see very strong demand for our small cell networks. At the end of the first quarter, we had nearly 12,000 small cell nodes and over 6,000 miles of fiber. The contribution to site rental revenue from our small cell networks is up approximately 20% year-over-year. For the quarter, nonrenewal of tenant leases reaching their contractual term end dates, inclusive of Sprint's iDEN decommissioning, was in line with our expectations.","Moving on to Slide 5. Site rental gross margin increased $81 million to $519 million, up 19% from the first quarter of 2013. Site rental gross margin percentage is lower by approximately 175 basis points year-over-year as we closed on the AT&T tower transaction, which had an average tenancy of 1.7 tenants and, therefore, lower margins when compared to our legacy assets with approximately 3 tenants.","However, the organic incremental margins were in excess of 90%, at the high end of our historical average and reflective of the high operating leverage of the tower business model. In the absence of additional acquisitions, we expect to see our site rental gross margins expand as carriers add equipment to our sites.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 20%, driven by the inclusion of the AT&T towers, an increase in site rental gross margin and strong performance of our network services business, and offset to a small degree by increased G&A, which was up about 8% year-over-year. This increase in G&A includes the effect of increased staffing to manage our T-Mobile and AT&T tower transactions, which increased our tower portfolio by nearly 75%, and the significant growth of our small cell networks.","AFFO was $349 million compared to $263 million from a year ago, an increase of 33%. On a per share basis, AFFO was up 17%, increasing from $0.90 per share to $1.05 per share.","As mentioned in our press release last night, we have updated our AFFO definition to reflect the benefit of prepaid rent from customers over the life of customer contracts rather than the period in which the prepaid rent was received. We believe the change will enhance comparability between us and our tower peers as we highlight the significant and growing cash flow of our -- our business produces. Obviously, the change to the AFFO definition does not change our cash flow profile or our investment capacity. Under the previous definition of AFFO, we would have exceeded the midpoint of our Q1 outlook by approximately $25 million.","With respect to how the change in the definition is likely to affect our AFFO results, our AFFO will be lower initially because the cash received from prepaid rent in the current period is significantly greater than the amortization of prepaid rent received in prior periods. This is primarily due to the fact that we have increased our portfolio of towers and small cell networks significantly over the last several years. Assuming no additional acquisitions and similar levels of leasing activity, we would expect the amount of prepaid rent and amortization of prepaid rent to converge over time.","Turning to investments and financing activities as shown on Slide 6. Since the beginning of the year, we refinanced or extended the maturities on $2.6 billion of our debt. In the first quarter of 2014, we extended the maturities on $1.8 billion of our Term Loan B by 2 years. Further, earlier this month, we closed on an 8-year $850 million senior notes offering with a coupon of 4.875%. Proceeds from the offering will be used to refinance $800 million of existing debt that has a weighted average coupon of approximately 6%. After giving effect to the aforementioned notes offering, our current weighted average cost of debt stands at 4.2%, with a weighted average maturity of 6 years. Our total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA is 5.4x, and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense is 4.2x. We expect to continue to de-lever through growth in adjusted EBITDA, trending towards approximately 5x debt to adjusted EBITDA.","During the first quarter, we invested $143 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $20 million in our land lease purchase program. During the quarter, we extended 340 land leases on our sites by an average of approximately 26 years. The extension activity impacted consolidated recurring cash ground lease expense by approximately 20 basis points.","Additionally, we purchased land beneath approximately 130 of our towers during the quarter. As of today, we own or control, for more than 20 years, land under towers representing 72% of our site rental gross margin. In fact, today, approximately 1\/3 of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own. Where we have ground leases, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years.","Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business as we look to protect our assets and control our largest operating expense. We have provided more information regarding our ground interest activity in our supplemental information package that we referenced last night in our press release.","Of the remaining capital expenditures, we invested $11 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $111 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures, the latter consisting of $75 million on existing sites and $36 million on the construction of new sites, primarily small cell construction activity.","We had no meaningful acquisitions of towers in the first quarter. Further, during the quarter, we paid our first quarterly common stock dividend of $0.35 per share or $117 million in aggregate. Also during the quarter, we purchased $21 million of common shares at an average price of $74 per share.","Moving on to the 2014 outlook as shown on Slide 7. Based on our first quarter results, our expectations of continued strong activity from the carriers for the remainder of the year and our recent financing activities, we've increased our full year 2014 outlook for site rental revenues, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by $11 million, $9 million, $26 million and $28 million, respectively, at the midpoint.","As shown on Slide 8, the midpoint of our 2014 outlook for site rental revenues implies growth of 19% or approximately $480 million compared to full year 2013. On an organic basis, before nonrenewals, our outlook implies revenue growth of approximately 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. The 9% is comprised of approximately 5% from new leasing activity and approximately 4% from escalations on existing customer lease contracts. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, our outlook assumes a 15% increase in quarterly new leasing activity for the remainder of 2014.","Our 2014 outlook for site rental revenues also includes the negative impact of nonrenewals of approximately 2% of site rental revenues. Approximately half of the nonrenewal impact is expected to come from Sprint's decommissioning of their legacy iDEN network and the remainder is expected to come from typical nonrenewal activity.","Based on Sprint's stated intention to decommission their iDEN network and our contractual terms at Sprint, we believe approximately 3% of our run rate site rental revenues will be impacted by the iDEN network decommissioning. This iDEN leases have effective term end dates spread evenly throughout 2014 and 2015.","With respect to 2014 adjusted EBITDA, our increased outlook implies 16% growth year-over-year and reflects the previously mentioned increase in site rental gross margin and higher expected services gross margin contribution. While the increases in staffing cost are a headwind to this growth in the short term, we believe the investment will allow us to maximize and execute on our leading portfolio of assets over the long run.","As presented on Slide 9, after adjusting our previously provided full year 2014 outlook for AFFO from January for the updated definition, on an apples-to-apples basis, our new outlook increases AFFO guidance by $28 million at the midpoint. Our increased AFFO reflects the increase in our outlook for adjusted EBITDA and from interest savings from our recent financing activities, offset by an increase in sustaining capital expenditures related to additional office facilities.","On a per share basis, our 2014 outlook implies AFFO growth of 11% before considering the benefit of the investment of our cash flows and after the 1% drag from additional office facility CapEx. For the full year 2014, we believe we will generate $425 million to $525 million in discretionary investment capacity.","I'd like to spend just a minute to describe the sequential impact to the second quarter of 2014 from certain onetime or seasonal items. Our second quarter growth is impacted by the previously mentioned onetime $5 million benefit from Revol's termination payment in Q1. Additionally, as is typical when going from the first quarter to the second quarter and warmer weather, repair and maintenance quarter-to-quarter is higher by $3 million.","Further, on an AFFO basis, sustaining capital expenditures for the second quarter is expected to be higher by $11 million, which includes the additional office facilities I spoke to a moment ago versus the first quarter of 2014.","Moving back to the high level, consistent with our full year outlook, the positive industry backdrop, which Ben will speak to, really supports our belief that there is a long runway of site rental revenue growth as the wireless operators continue to expand and improve their networks. Given the high operating leverage of the business, we believe our organic site rental revenue growth can translate into meaningful organic AFFO growth before considering the benefit of investments that we can make from the significant and growing cash flows generated by our business.","These investments include acquisitions; construction of new sites, including small cell networks; land purchases; and the purchases of our own security that we believe will further enhance long-term AFFO per share growth. Our longstanding approach to capital allocation, combined with strong execution, has driven significant growth in AFFO per share, which we believe is a good measure of our ability to pay and grow our dividends over a long -- over the long term. Importantly, we believe we will be able to produce this growth without increasing the risk profile of our business.","In summary, we are focused on total shareholder returns comprised of growth in dividends and AFFO per share. As we have said previously, we expect to grow our dividends to common shareholders by at least 15% per year over the next 5 years and continue to see significant growth in AFFO per share.","Lastly, before I turn the call over to Ben, I'd like to point out that we have posted to our website, along with our earnings release, a new supplemental information package. The supplemental information package is a part of our goal to continue to enhance our communication and disclosure practices. Many of the metrics I spoke to today are reconciled or presented in further detail on the supplemental package. We believe the supplemental information package will be a useful tool that will assist investors in understanding and evaluating our business model and overall performance.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Thanks, Jay, and thanks to all of you for joining us on this call on this busy reporting morning.","As Jay just walked you through, the first quarter was another great quarter, exceeding the high end of outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Given the level of activity that we are seeing, we are excited about the balance of the year.","Our current application pipeline leads us to expect new leasing activity per quarter for the remainder of the year to be approximately 15% higher compared to the level we experienced in the first quarter 2014. This level of activity, combined with our excellent first quarter results, allows us to raise our 2014 outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.","As all 4 major wireless carriers continue to invest in their networks for LTE and capacity enhancement, I'm excited about the prospects of sustainable long-term growth over the next several years. This is particularly true given our position as the leading shared wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S., nearly 40,000 towers and 12,000 small cell nodes in operation.","As shown on Slide 10, we have a long track record of execution and growth through various cycles, whether it be macroeconomic or industry-specific cycles. Through this period of 14 years, we have delivered strong organic growth, as well as growth through disciplined capital allocation. As you can see from these results, we are committed to a long-term focus that delivers significant value over time.","With our industry-leading portfolio of assets and capabilities in the U.S., we expect to continue this track record in the most dynamic growth market for wireless. Over the last 2 years, we've invested approximately $9 billion in acquisitions, executing on our strategic objectives to expand our U.S. portfolio of towers and small cells.","Turning to Slide 11. We believe that these recent acquisitions provide us with opportunities to grow shareholder value through execution, similar to the acquisitions we have made in the past. Quite simply, our strategy is to replicate the performance of our legacy assets with our recent acquisitions. Tower assets that we have owned and operated for more than 10 years currently yield 15% on total invested capital, representing significant shareholder value creation when compared to the initial yields at the time of purchase of approximately 4% to 5%, similar to our recent acquisitions. I believe our strategy will continue to prove successful, given our investment in our people, processes and assets, which are focused on enabling carriers to meet the demand for wireless services.","We believe our recent acquisitions of small cell networks and towers were well-timed as network investments by carriers continue unabated. As carriers continue to invest in their networks, consumers and businesses have quickly absorbed the capacity added by the carriers.","Consumers and businesses continue to innovate and develop new applications and devices that will take advantage of the mobile Internet. This has led to a reinforcing cycle of investment by the carriers and increased usage by the end consumers.","During 2013, Cisco's annual report on mobile data traffic reported that U.S. mobile data consumption grew 75% over 2012. Cisco projects that between 2013 and 2018, mobile data traffic, even after accounting for Wi-Fi offloading, will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 50% or an 8x increase in the next 5 years. This growth in usage can be seen in all of our everyday lives.","The convenience and accessibility of mobile devices made smartphones and tablets the dominant channel for Internet consumption and changing the way we live, work and play. For businesses, mobile Internet is changing the way companies operate, innovate and compete. There are mountains of positive statistics and trends about mobile Internet usage, and I'd like to highlight just a few.","From an entertainment perspective, a majority of consumers believe mobile devices will replace traditional televisions as the most common way to consume television shows and movies in the next 8 years. A separate survey confirms that this trend is well underway with smartphones' screen time already outpacing TV screen time today.","Further, Cisco reports that video already represents 50% of mobile Internet traffic and is projected to continue to grow at a 55% compound annual growth rate over the next 5 years.","As it relates to health, 95 million Americans are currently using mobile phones as health tools. The mobile health industry or mHealth is projected to grow 15x by 2018 to reach $20 billion of value as wireless technology has proven to increase efficiency and improve results. Remote patient monitoring is projected to save Americans $36 billion in health care cost by 2018.","And terms such as the Internet of Things or the Connected Life have been coined to describe the machine-to-machine connectivity that we're already seeing. Today, there are approximately 10 billion connected devices, ranging from GPS location devices to thermostats to smart meters. This number is projected to increase to 30 billion devices by 2020.","Cisco further projects that mobile data traffic created by these devices will increase 68-fold by 2018, driven by increased penetration of technologies such as connected cars and smart-wearable devices. To meet this growing demand, carriers are investing in their networks. And to effectively build out their networks, carriers need economic incentive, spectrum and infrastructure like we provide.","When it comes to economic incentive, we believe the U.S. market has the largest and the fastest-growing wireless market in the world, provides a landscape for the ability of the wireless carriers to make profitable investment its most apparent, and barriers to entry remain high.","As shown on Slide 12, the U.S. market is uniquely attractive due to its relative size and robustness compared to other markets. Strong unit economics with average ARPUs greater than $50 a month, combined with high correlation between network investment and low consumer churn, has led carriers to continue to upgrade their networks to improve network quality, increase capacity and add functionality in order to remain competitive and grow. As a result, we would expect current network upgrade and densification activity by the 4 major wireless carriers to continue for quite some time.","On the spectrum front, there's approximately 600 megahertz of spectrum in the hands of carriers and potential entrants, including LightSquared, DISH and FirstNet. Of this 600 megahertz, approximately 350 megahertz is actually deployed and is currently being used by consumers. That leaves another approximately 250 megahertz to be deployed depending upon the market.","Some of this spectrum, including Sprint's 2.5, T-Mobile's 700 megahertz and Verizon's AWS, represent near-term to intermediate-term opportunities for Crown Castle. Other spectrum, primarily held by LightSquared, DISH and FirstNet, represents longer-term opportunities.","Additionally, the FCC has proposed freeing up another approximately 150 megahertz over the next several years. It's possible that over the next decade, the total amount of spectrum deployed could double, a positive for Crown Castle as additional spectrum has historically led to additional equipment being deployed on our sites.","Before I turn the call over for questions, I think it's instructive to compare the current 4G deployment cycle with the 3G deployment cycle that we're familiar with. 3G was initially deployed in 2002 and continued through 2009 to 2010 time frame when 4G deployments began. Based on the 3G cycle, we believe that we are still in the early innings of the 4G investment cycle.","Verizon and AT&T initially led the way with 4G, and currently, they are focused on network densification, having addressed coverage in the early part of their rollouts. Sprint and T-Mobile are fast on their heels and soon will finish their initial coverage buildout. If history and Verizon and AT&T's experience holds, we expect that Sprint and T-Mobile will soon be focusing on network densification, and we are already seeing signs of those conversations happening -- that would be in the 2015 time frame.","Given the revolutionary nature of 4G, we have reasons to believe that the 4G LTE deployment cycle will be even longer than the 3G cycle. And in order to meet Cisco's projected 8x increase in mobile data demand, we believe carriers will continue to invest over a multiyear period. This multiyear deployment cycle gives us confidence in the long runway of sustained organic revenue growth.","Our team has a tremendous track record of execution, giving me a lot of confidence it will be able to leverage this unprecedented level of activity. With nearly 40,000 towers and 12,000 small cells in the U.S., as I previously mentioned, I believe we are well poised to continue to benefit greatly from these macro trends as we have in the past.","In the near term, our team is working diligently to integrate the AT&T towers into our portfolio so that we're able to deliver a Crown quality customer service experience across these assets as soon as possible. We have made significant strides to that end in the first several months since closing. And while it's early, our operating results are off to a good start across these new assets.","So in wrapping up and moving towards questions, our strategy remains unchanged. We are focused on adding site rental revenue across our portfolio of assets and investing our capital to maximize our long-term total shareholder return, which we measure as growth in AFFO per share, plus the increasing dividend we anticipate in the years to come.","With that, operator, can you please turn the call over for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question today will come from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First, thanks for providing the supplemental information and making what was probably not an easy decision but going to a consistent comparable AFFO definition. We appreciate that. A couple of questions. First, on the organic growth side, can you -- obviously, services business had another good quarter. It was big in 4Q, continued to be big in 1Q. Help us understand what your thoughts are now as far as how much that's going to contribute in '14? And then also in the organic side, in the supplemental exhibits you gave, there's some nice color on 1Q, Page 13 talking about 8.5% growth and 1.4% churn for cash organic net growth. But then, for the year, that organic growth goes up to 8.8%, but churn jumps to 2.7%. Help us understand, is that the iDEN stuff? Or what's going on there? And what should we think as we look into '15, '16, what that looks like?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. I think the -- as you look at the growth of the full year, if you're looking at the outlook, there's a couple of things that are happening. Obviously, we've folded in the AT&T results; that is entirely in the first quarter, and that will continue for the balance of the year. On the cost side, we're staffing up in the first quarter, both in terms of direct expenses that would hit the gross margin, site rental gross margin line and also some of G&A and then the buildout of the facilities, which would impact AFFO. And that's -- most of that is starting to come in during Q2. There may be a little bit of it that doesn't get all the way in Q2 and would impact Q3, but I think most of that will be in the Q2. So I think that reconciles how to think about the addition of the AT&T asset. On the second part of the question, we're expecting organic growth to accelerate over the back half of the year. As I think Ben and I both mentioned in our comments, the leasing that we're assuming in Qs 2, 3 and 4 on average is about 15% higher than what we saw in Q1. And that's coming from all of the items that Ben mentioned around the big 4 operators. Most of that is new tenant installation on sites rather than amendments as we've seen over the last several years. So it's site densification and them adding additional sites.","W. Benjamin Moreland","And we see that in the pipeline today, given that we're sitting here in late April. We can see most of that already in the pipeline.","Jay A. Brown","And then on the churn side, most of that is iDEN. So that started to come into the revenue side in the first quarter, although most of it really we only saw 1 month worth of churn in the first quarter from iDEN, and then we'll see it for the balance of the year. As we go into the calendar year next year, I think we previously mentioned we thought during calendar year '14, we would see about 1% impact to revenues from churn from iDEN, a little over 1%. And then the balance of it we would expect to see in '15. And then any licenses that are canceled in the back half of '15 obviously will have a little bit of fall-over into '16. So probably 1\/3 this year, 2\/3 next year as you're trying to time out when we'll see the impact from iDEN.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Makes sense. And then on external growth, it looks like you had $62 million worth of acquisitions in the quarter. Was that for buying building towers? And then, Ben, you've hit pretty hard about how the U.S. is the best market you feel for wireless. What are your thoughts internationally? Is there anything that would be interesting to you in how you frame that?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure, you want to take the first part?","Jay A. Brown","Yes. On the CapEx side, those were all either CapEx we're adding on existing sites and then the construction of new sites, the vast majority of which would be in small cells. We didn't have any meaningful tower acquisitions in the first quarter.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Ric, we -- obviously, we're very proud of our track record and our business model around the economics of shareable infrastructure, and that clearly translates really to many markets around the world as wireless is a growing business worldwide today and we see that in our international business in Australia today. So we completely support the notion of shared infrastructure in other countries, and we continue to look. The challenge we've had thus far and the reason we haven't pulled the trigger on anything of any size has been the initial upfront price relative to the cost of capital in those other markets. We've just not been able to get to a sort of risk-adjusted total return expectation on lease-up, which you have to have when you impose the currency risk and inflation and other things that happen in some of those markets. It comes at a premium. And in our opinion, we haven't been able to meet the price or expectations of sellers and, therefore, haven't pulled the trigger. So it's merely a function of price. It has really not a lot to do with -- at a price, the shared model certainly works sense -- makes sense and works anywhere in the world. We are extremely bullish as we talked about on what we see happening in the U.S. market. We would note that we're in pretty good company with Verizon's decision to acquire their Vodafone interest. So we've got a lot on our plate here. The small cell business is going well, and as networks densify and add new cell sites to accommodate the capacity, we've got a lot to do here.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And what is small cell -- I think you said it's grown significantly. But what is it out of the total leasing revenue?","Jay A. Brown","It's a little over 5%, almost 6%. And as I mentioned in my comments, it's up about 20% year-over-year, Ric.","Operator","Your next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Jay, maybe I think at the last couple of weeks of last year's fourth quarter, we had about an $18 million contribution from the AT&T portfolio. And I think that you ended up guiding to about $400 million -- embedded in the guidance, $400 million contribution for 2014. Obviously, the annualized run rate of last year's AT&T portfolio growth would have been probably closer to $33 million higher than that. So can you talk a little bit about realized performance in the AT&T portfolio and how changes in expectations for the contribution of that portfolio to 2014 have influenced your guidance setting? And the last question is just on the 20% growth year-over-year in the small cell business, could give us an update on how big that business is now today as a percentage of the total?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On the first question, I would say so far, the AT&T assets are performing very well in terms of the run rate of both revenues and gross margin that we acquired relative to what we expected in the acquisition. On a cash basis, it's slightly ahead of what we had underwritten and expected to have coming out of the gate. There's obviously whenever you -- if you're looking at the GAAP revenue numbers, there's the impacts of straight-line, both in terms of site rental revenues and site rental direct expenses related to ground leases. So there's some movement there, but on a cash basis, it's slightly ahead. And there is some benefit in our uplift of about $11 million in site rental revenue. A portion of that would be related to higher run rate -- initial run rates out of the AT&T portfolio, as well as the activity that I spoke about earlier of about 15% higher in the second half of the year and second quarter -- and second, third and fourth quarter of the year compared to the first quarter. So it's a combination of those 2 things that's driving the increase in revenue. On the 20% growth, again, it's about 6% of consolidated revenues today, and it's up about 20% year-over-year. Ben, I don't know if you want to speak to any details on what we're seeing.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Well, I would just say, yes, we're just -- we're seeing a very significant uptake in small cell architecture among -- amongst several of the carriers as they're using it as a way to add capacity in dense markets. When we talk about small cell, as you know, we're in the indoor business and the outdoor business. Certainly, we're doing a number of venues, and those are co-locatable networks and I'm very pleased with that. We're also having great success and a growing building of a pipeline in the outdoor small cell architecture. We're, again, serving higher density locations where macro sites are just unable to handle the traffic. And so this is an underlay type of architecture across where they would certainly already be coverage. And we're seeing a very significant uptake this year in that architecture and one that I think will ultimately be adopted in a robust way by all 4 of the major wireless carriers over time.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And Jay, if I can just a quick follow-up. The 20% growth in 6% of the business, so that's obviously giving you a percentage point of incremental revenue tailwind. Is that factored into the 8% organic same-store sales revenue growth before disconnects in the slide deck?","Jay A. Brown","It is, both on the historical data, as well as the look forward.","W. Benjamin Moreland","And the 9% forward.","Jay A. Brown","Yes.","Operator","Your next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I was interested in the nature of the staff increases that you've referenced, maybe a little bit more color on both direct expenses and the G&A-type staffing that you're doing. Secondly, on the DAS, I -- you gave the year-on-year growth rates and the scale of the business. Can you talk about whether your incremental investments in DAS, is that going towards more nodes or more fiber mileage, or can you give us a little bit of color about what's happening on the infrastructure side? And then my last question is on M2M Spectrum Networks in the press release that came out earlier in the month and kind of what your expectations are from that partnership and what they're doing.","Jay A. Brown","Okay. On the first question around the direct expenses in G&A, maybe the easiest way to do it, Jon, is to start from Q1 and then walk you to Q2. And then after Q2, as I mentioned, I think it will mostly be in the run rate. Moving from Q1 to Q2, there's the warmer weather impacts that we always see, as well as having more towers. That steps up direct site rental expenses by approximately $3 million from Q1 to Q2. The second item that's meaningful in site rental operating expenses would be around staffing, and that number moves up about $2 million roughly from Q1 to Q2. And that's a result -- as a result of us hiring folks throughout the first quarter to staff properly for the AT&T transaction. And then by the time we get to the second quarter, it's fully in the run rate. So I wouldn't expect meaningful steps in those expenses in Q3 and Q4. If you go to the cash G&A line, and this would exclude stock-based comp because as you look at our G&A line, the G&A line I think will look almost completely flat year-over-year. So the impact to EBITDA, and you can look at what is happening in -- around cash G&A. And there, there's probably another $2 million to $3 million step-up that we're seeing inside the quarter from Q1 to Q2 for a similar reason as to what I was speaking about in direct expenses where we staffed up during the first quarter and then we have the full run rate in the second quarter. And then from there, I would expect we'll see, both in terms of direct site rental expenses and G&A, those numbers to return to something in the neighborhood of about 3% growth on an annual basis from normal cost escalations.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Secondly, Jon, you asked about the incremental investment and activity we're seeing on the small cell side. Primarily, what we're doing is we're benefiting from the significant fiber plant that we acquired in the NextG acquisition back in 2012. From that, which we have significant fiber plant in many major cities, we're co-locating across that existing fiber plant, as well as adding additional laterals to that, extending the capacity of that plant into other locations. And so it gets sort of very blurry. It's not quite as clear-cut as the tower model where you're adding a tenant on an existing tower. Effectively, you're adding an additional tenant or node on existing fiber, and it may come with modifications or extensions to that fiber that we're doing on behalf of that tenant, with an expectation for further tenancy over time. So the term co-location is still alive and well in that business and working very well. It often comes with additional fiber that we're building, again, shareable among many. And then the last point.","Jay A. Brown","I think you were asking, Ric, about the mobile-to-mobile, M2M solutions press release that went out earlier in the month. That was a transaction or partnership that we've done with somebody to continue to build out small cells, and I think it's relatively small and won't be that impactful to site rental revenues or gross margins, adjusted EBITDA in the near term. I think there are, as Ben was speaking to in his commentary, there are a number of connected devices. And we're going to see the impact of those, or believe we'll see the impact of those, both on our traditional towers, as well as in the small cell space, for a long period of time. And so this was an early one that they wanted to put out, their desire to engage us in a meaningful way, from their perspective, to get their solution rolled out.","W. Benjamin Moreland","I think, Jay, you mentioned in your comments that our -- the vast majority, about 90%, of our activity right now is from the Big 4 carriers. And that's skewed a little high lately. For years, the -- what I would call the \"other category\" has been the equivalent of sort of one of the other Big 4. So there's sort of a Big 5 out there. And then of late, that has been light in that there's -- most of the activity has been around the Big 4 carriers. This M2M-type announcement highlights that there are always other people with access to spectrum, as I mentioned longer-term thoughts around DISH, LightSquared and FirstNet, that certainly stand to contribute to our growth over time, but not in the current outlook.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So if I could follow up then, the nature of the AT&T integration CapEx, what does that consist of? And then on the fiber footprint that you mentioned, I did ask this several quarters ago, are there opportunities to monetize that for non-mobile carriers or even enterprises given the metro nature of the fiber assets that you have?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. I'll take the first one. You can do the second one, Ben. On the AT&T CapEx, we would have the normal repair and maintenance CapEx that we would expect to have. That will be on a recurring basis. And we'll start that during calendar year 2014 and we expect that to continue annually. Jon, if you're trying to pencil that out for the model, that generally works out to about $700 of CapEx per tower per annum. And so we've adjusted our outlook for sustaining capital expenditures to include that roughly $700 per asset. In addition to that, in the calendar year 2014, we're building out some additional office facilities to house the additional employees that I mentioned in the -- in my answer to your first question, and so there is some CapEx this year. It's going to be in the neighborhood in total of about $17 million. Obviously, I don't expect that to recur in future years. So that will be a cost we incur in calendar year 2014. And then beyond that, we would just have our normal repair and maintenance CapEx on a per asset basis.","W. Benjamin Moreland","It's a little spike this year. And then on the monetization of the existing fiber plant, obviously, we're working hard every day to add small cell nodes to that fiber. But to your point, we have a small level of fiber-to-the-cell business already monetizing some of that fiber. And we have some other opportunities that I wouldn't call material yet, but are interesting. And I think there's a number of ways over time we can monetize the fiber, those that we already own and what we may construct over time. But as yet, Jon, it's probably not material enough to really highlight.","Operator","Your next question will come from Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.","Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research","Yes. How much capacity do T-Mo and AT&T have under their MLAs? And as these companies start to build out 700 megahertz Leap and then AWS3, could you see amendment revenue from these carriers later this year and especially 2015, or is this restricted by the MLAs?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. Kevin, we -- as we've talked about, we're down to about 10% of our activity now as being covered by the so-called MLA contracts that were prepaid, if you will, presold. And we expect that to continue to fall. So really, any future activities, the most significant portion of that would be new revenue opportunities going forward. Without getting real specific by carrier, by market, we expect that 10% level to sort of hold and trail off over time.","Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research","Is it fair to think of the 700 at T-Mo and the Leap spectrum and AWS at Verizon, is that more of a '15 event?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, I would characterize it as more of a '15 event, exactly, given that we're already 1\/3 of the way through the year.","Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research","So there's not a -- the implied organic growth acceleration does not include a lot from these new spectrum bands?","W. Benjamin Moreland","That's right. Exactly.","Operator","Your next question on line will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I would love to touch on the overall spending environment debate here. You folks are once again raising your outlook for the year. Thus far, we've seen positive commentary from the carriers that have reported around their spending initiatives, particularly noting that densification is fairly important. I would welcome any additional color on how you think about the densification opportunity, particularly the size of the opportunity relative to the initial coverage upgrades to LTE. In other words, when we think about all the equipment needed at the site to optimize LTE traffic, be it fiber cabling, remote radio heads, multiband antennas or whatever the carriers are working with, is this densification opportunity for 4G as large an opportunity as sort of initial network deployments?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. Thanks, Amir. This is Ben. I'll take a crack at that one. Densification and the anticipation of adding additional cell sites after the initial coverage build is our entire business thesis. We've spent $9 billion on buying 17,000 towers and 10,000 DAS nodes in the last few years just based on that exact view. And that is now happening and playing out in spades. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, where in the case of Verizon and AT&T, they're actively moving into that cell site densification activity, adding additional locations where they weren't previously present, going on new towers as their LTE networks load up and they need to add capacity. That's also what we're seeing on the small cell side. We fully expect, if history is any guide, that you'll see the same occur out of Sprint and T-Mobile over time as they complete their initial coverage build on LTE. And we're already having initial conversations with them around their build plans for 2015 in anticipation of that happening. So our thesis, which again played out quite well back from 1999 to today, is that you have initial coverage build, and then you have infill, and that's exactly what we're seeing happening in the market today and what we expect will happen for many years to come as we lease up these new sites we've acquired with roughly 1.7 tenants per tower. We have a lot of capacity and a lot of locations that can quickly and efficiently aid these carriers in adding capacity into their networks. So that's what we're all about.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And if I may, just a follow-up, you folks are fairly uniquely positioned in sort of your focus on the DAS and some of the small cell technologies. If I think about where we are today in transitioning towards more densification initiatives, have you seen any switch in priorities on -- in terms of spending? In other words, are carriers that you work with both on the DAS side and on the macro side reallocating capital? Or is it just more spend to everything?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Well, it really is carrier-specific, again depending upon where they are in their deployment cycle with 4G. But I would say that we have seen absolutely no evidence of switching as you used that term. What we've seen is sort of more of everything. And so of those that are now in the densification mode, there's a very heightened sense of urgency to add capacity to deal with all of the requirements and demands that we, as consumers, are putting on these networks, as we mentioned with mobile video, connected machine-to-machine, voice over LTE, which is still coming. So there is a lot of future demand that the carriers honestly are trying to build in anticipation of and keep up with our current needs. But I haven't seen any evidence of switching per se. It's just now we have an architecture that adds capacity very efficiently in high dense areas and reuses that frequency on a -- with very small cells and reuses that frequency frequently. That's something that we're continuing to benefit from and working very hard to optimize. We've got a lot of people working on building out the -- in the co-location on the fiber that we mentioned on the small cell side and a very robust pipeline there.","Operator","Your next question on the line will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess first, if I look at the acceleration going forward of activity in the business, it seems like there could be upside to your services business, as well. Is that acceleration something that you can capitalize on in services?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Well, Phil, we've got a pretty good track record of growing the services business, as you all know. We're also kind of reticent to guide up on services. But I would say that with the addition of 10,000 towers this year, we would naturally expect with the activity that we ought to be able to replicate last year. As you sort of back into the guidance, you can sort of figure out that the service activity for this year now is roughly the same as last year, that's sort of what's implicit in the guidance. Can we do better than that? We'll see as we go through the year. We are extremely pleased with the take rates and the confidence that our carrier customers are placing in us in helping them meet these needs, both on augmenting and amending cell sites, as well as brand-new installations. So we'll see, but it's continuing to go in a very big way.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then second, I guess on the small cell side. Is it easier to build small cell infrastructure where Crown has towers, or carriers consider reuse backhaul and you have some zoning and staff? Or does something else sort of drive the ability to build? Do you need local teams, or do those teams move around?","W. Benjamin Moreland","So we have a lot of local presence. I mean, we operate a national business since we have people in local markets. And while I would say there has been some overlap and some benefit, and I would suggest to you in the future there will be more benefit and more overlap, where we have towers where you can even use some compounds at towers to build laterals off of tower sites into the small cell architecture, that has not been a real material part of the activity so far. I think it will over time. What the most, I guess, determining factor is for us and what's the most efficient, obviously, is where we already have fiber. Where we already have some of these 6,200 miles of fiber that we own in these major cities, that becomes a very compelling proposition for carriers looking to add an architecture in those markets. And then obviously, we have to build more as we're serving additional locations with laterals off of that spectrum -- I mean, off of that fiber. But obviously, the most important part of that is having that embedded fiber base already there, and that's yielding this pipeline we've spoken about.","Jay A. Brown","Probably the other synergy, Phil, I might just mention for you, is really on the sales side and sales cycle, this activity. We've talked about for years that when we do our customer surveys that we have the highest rate of customer service in the industry. And so as we broadened our service opportunity for small cells and demonstrated to the carriers in the early days that we're able to do these successfully to build them on time, to make them work, we've got a great track record of that. And that helps us as the carriers are looking to expand their portfolio. And I think our track record and our sales effort there has been really helpful, and that, obviously, has benefited greatly from the synergies of how well we've done over a long period of time on the tower side and on the services side. They trust us and they know we'll do what we say we're going to do. So I think that has benefited us greatly since we did the large acquisition 2 years ago.","Operator","The next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Ben, you talked about FirstNet a couple of times. It seems like the funding is coming into view here with the H Block and the AWS auctions. Have you been able to get more substantive conversations in terms of trying to feel like is that something that could start contributing in '15 or is it still sort of '16, '17? And then, again, thanks for the supplemental disclosure. If I'm reading it right, you're about 71% of the top 100 markets. How does the growth trajectory look in your top 100 markets versus the other markets? Are we still seeing a superior growth trajectory there, or is it more even now?","W. Benjamin Moreland","No, I would suggest the top 100 markets are probably even accelerating from what you see as the historical -- we provided in the supplement now the historical run rates of revenue, both top 100 and otherwise, on those towers. So you can see the spread there. I would suggest it's accelerating as the density of those markets is where all this capacity is required on top of the tower business, and I would overlay the small cell business and say, obviously, that's happening primarily in the top 100 markets, although not completely, primarily in the top 100 markets. So that's -- I think that's probably going to accelerate over time. The FirstNet activity, Simon, I hate to put a timeline on it. You can expect, given our position in the market, that we are very close to FirstNet and what's going on there. And they've got the keys to our system and are profiling our sites and portfolios in various markets and know how we could assist them, and we're in constant dialogue. But I would really not want to sort of put a timeline on exactly when we would think that would turn into revenue. As you know, there's a lot of moving pieces there, state by state, and so let's hold that one out for now. And obviously, it's a nice opportunity that we think will yield something in the future, but not in the current outlook.","Operator","Your next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. I wanted to go back to the organic growth and I guess, more specifically, the churn. So you reported in the supplemental, it was 1.4% in the quarter, and the guide was 2.7% for the year. So obviously, an expectation for a meaningful increase as we go through the year. When we think about it collectively and we think of just total site rental revenue, do you expect the fourth quarter to be the low point for total site rental revenue based on that rising churn, or is it more going to happen in the second or third quarter and then we start to grow from there? I'm just trying to get a sense of what's the low point as it relates to site rental revenue as a result of the churn so we can get a better understanding what the jumpoff point might be as we go into 2015. And then just kind of going through your supplementals related to small cell, if I take the 6% of revenue that small cell represents as site rental revenue and just divide that by the node, I get to about $1,300, which you are generating per small cell -- or excuse me, per node right now. Is that -- could you give us an idea of how many customers are averaging on a per node so we can get a better sense of what you're generating on a per customer basis? And just curious, are you getting escalators for that, call it, $1,300 per month? And just getting a sense, is that a good number to look at, or does it vary widely so don't read too much into it? I'm just trying to get a bit of a sense of how we should start thinking about modeling out small cell.","Jay A. Brown","Sure, Colby. On your first question, the churn numbers looks -- I think it's important to draw a delineation between as you're thinking about the impact to site rental revenues in the full year 2014 versus full year 2015, as you asked that question. There is, as I mentioned in my comments, an acceleration by virtue of the fact that the iDEN churn didn't start occurring until March of this year. So as you go through the balance of the year, you, in essence, start to have full quarter impacts from the prior quarter nonrenewals. So really, in the second, third and fourth quarter, we're expecting a similar level of nonrenewals as we go through each of those quarters. The back half of the year, the cumulative impact of that is higher, and it will continue to grow all the way through calendar year 2015, which would have the highest cumulative amount of impact. But on a steady state, as you're thinking about sequential change quarter-to-quarter, the biggest news there is really Q1 to Q2 as we go from 1 month of impact to a full quarter impact. And then after that, you kind of have full quarter impacts. So the sequential change is most impacted then from Q1 to Q2. As we look at the revenue outlook for the balance of the year, given that we're expecting an increase in leasing of 10% at the organic growth line, that number would accelerate over the course of the year. So your sequential steps in net revenue quarter-to-quarter are going to be degraded by the time you get to the fourth quarter. So hopefully that sort of helps you think through your model. On the second question, I think as you get into the pricing on a tenant basis with small cells, it's a little different than traditional towers because the systems are priced based on what needs to occur at the local level in order to accomplish that buildout. So these are priced much more on a return basis. I would say, generally speaking, you kind of laid out the numbers, you're in the general ballpark of what small cells revenue impact is on a per site basis. Maybe a little high, but there are certain systems that are going to be even higher than the number that you mentioned and other systems that are lower. So we're pricing these on a return basis. And as we've said historically, we think the returns on small cells are similar to that of towers, if you price them on a ticket system that has 3 tenants on them or 4 tenants on them. And the returns on those would look very similar to a tower that would have 3 to 4 tenants. The business is performing very well, and the lease-up that we're seeing on the small cells that we've built thus far, they're actually leasing faster than what we've historically seen from towers. So the returns or the margins or how we want to think about yields on those assets, they're achieving yields higher than -- over a shorter period of time from what we've traditionally seen in towers, which is probably a better way to think about it rather than trying to price that out on a per node basis, because we're pricing these based on the invested capital required in order to accomplish them.","Operator","Your next question will come from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just 2 clarifications. Last year, I think you talked about 8% of organic growth. Was that net of churn? And then just on Colby's question, did the small cells have escalators embedded in them? And then, Ben, I get asked the question a lot so I figured I'd ask you. Any kind of current thoughts on potential technological cannibalization? I know the cable companies sound like they're going to be deploying Wi-Fi hotspots fairly aggressively. I believe there was an article yesterday that -- of a pCell technology that DISH might be trialing. I guess is that kind of maybe a risk or benefit to you guys?","Jay A. Brown","On the first question, the 8% number we were talking about last year, that was on a gross basis before nonrenewals. So we're now -- we've moved that number from 8% to 9%. That 1% move is all related to the new leasing activity. Escalators are remaining the same as we've previously expected. We do have escalators on the DAS. Thank you for reasking the question. I'm sorry I missed that in Colby's question. There are embedded escalators in the DAS contracts. The terms of those leases are very similar to towers as we noted in the supplement. There's about 8 years remaining on the average term on those leases, and so they look very similar to tower leases, both in terms of term and escalation provisions.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Tim, on the technology question, as I think about technology, what we've seen that's been most impactful so far, aside from just spectral efficiencies we've gained in the equipment by putting our RUs [ph] up the tower and things like that, it has been the emergence of Wi-Fi hotspots. And I don't want to speak for my carrier customer friends, but I suspect in certain places, they're somewhat relieved that you're getting wireless -- somewhat a relief there through Wi-Fi hotspots. And I believe by some estimates, it's already offloading as much as 50% of the traffic when we're all using Wi-Fi when we can. It's our expectation that, as I've said in my prepared remarks, net of that kind of offloading node, in the mobile environment, there's licensed spectrum, and handoff from one cell to the other is sort of the dominant architecture. We're going to continue to see very significant growth on the licensed spectrum side, if for no other reason just because of the capacity requirements that's needed with, as we mentioned, with 350 megahertz out there and more to come. That's a whole lot more than you could traditionally do a Wi-Fi node. And then with respect to the pCell Artemis article the other day, from time to time, there are valuable new technologies that come up. They don't -- they change the laws of physics and they do require light installations and some level of backhaul connectivity into whether it's a vertical height or it's an installation that looks a lot like a small cell. And over time, to the extent that's viable, and I think it's very early days, but to the extent that's viable, I would think that would certainly be something we could benefit from over time.","Operator","Your last question will come from Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Last quarter, you had mentioned that you expected to be at the high end of 25% to 30% revenue increase for new leases. Now you're looking for a 15% sequential increase off of 1Q. So given the prior comments, how should we think about the overall annual growth? And the new installment and amendment mix that you gave, 85%, 15%, how does that compare to last year? And can you also provide some color on average rental revenue for amendments?","Jay A. Brown","Yes. On the first question, if you were to take the 25% to 30% that we said before and then factor in the 15% from Q2 to Q3, Q4, probably closer to about 35%, maybe a little bit more than that, year-over-year growth in terms of new activity and amendment activity. Combine that and think about that in terms of organic revenue growth on the sites. On the amendment activity, 85% of the total revenue activity, leasing activity that we're seeing is new licenses is 15%. That probably compares last year to somewhere in the neighborhood of about 60% new and 40% amendments. In the year prior to that, it was almost a complete inverse of '14 where we were seeing between 10% and 20% new licenses and about 80% almost of the activity was coming from amendments. Most of that speaks to the commentary that Ben gave around the carriers' move from the coverage buildout for 4G to looking at site densification. In terms of what we're seeing from both amendments and new leasing pricing, it's up from past years and, on a like-for-like basis if you look at the equipment being added, it's -- the pricing has gone up probably 3% to 4% on an annual basis. When you start to try to compare what's the average amendment or the average lease, you really have to do that analysis on a carrier by carrier basis and look at what equipment are they actually putting up. Otherwise, the numbers are not necessarily comparable, and we're not prepared to share pricing by carrier. So I think I'll stop there on the explanation.","W. Benjamin Moreland","I was about to stop you. I -- Listen, I appreciate everybody by going along with us this morning. I know it was a very busy morning for reporting. I want to commend the team for putting out the supplemental package. You can appreciate this was a lot of work to determine what we thought was most relevant to you, the investor. There's a lot of good information in here that I would encourage you to spend a little time with. I think most importantly, that I think is relevant, is it will help all of us more easily toggle between the GAAP reported revenue numbers and the adjusted numbers adjusted for straight-line and acquisitions. That's a challenging concept. It sounds easy. It's not. I appreciate that, and we -- it's challenging for us and we do it every day. So hopefully, some of this disclosure, for example, on Page 8 for one and others, that really kind of gets this into very granular terms is helpful for your own modeling and to really understand what's going on in the business. Again, thanks to the team for doing that, and thank you, again, for listening and staying along with us this morning. We look forward to reporting to you on another very successful quarter next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ben Lowe. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Lowe","Thank you, April, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our fourth quarter 2017 results. With me on the call this morning are Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning. ","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors sections of the company's SEC filings. Our statements are made as of today, January 25, 2018, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","In addition, today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Brown","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. As you saw from our earnings release yesterday afternoon, we finished 2017 on a strong note, delivering another quarter of solid financial results that capped off a terrific year for Crown Castle and its shareholders. ","We generated significant growth across our business by leveraging our leading portfolio of assets and focusing on our customers' evolving network needs, with this growth translating to an 8% increase in dividends per share compared to 2016. This growth was at the high end of our long-term annual dividends per share growth target and contributed significantly to the total return of 31% we generated for our shareholders, which compares favorably to the 22% returned by the S&P 500 in 2017. ","We generated these returns while investing over $10 billion to expand our leading portfolio of communications infrastructure assets and financed those investments in a manner that allowed us to reduce our leverage ratios, increase our maturity profile and lower our overall cost of capital. Further, we closed the acquisition of Lightower, the largest in our history, 2 months sooner than expected, and our early view of the operating performance of the business is in line with our expectations. ","As we turn the page on a great 2017, we believe the Crown Castle story remains compelling. We have positioned the company to benefit from a digital world, where massive amounts of data traverse networks. Based on this position, we are able to offer investors a unique value proposition of near-term returns consisting of a 4% dividend yield with 7% to 8% targeted annual growth while investing in assets and capabilities that we believe position us to generate growth for decades to come. Our leading portfolio of communications infrastructure assets has significant capacity to support future organic growth as our customers look to access our assets to meet the increasing demand for data. ","In 2017, we strengthened our leadership position with the acquisitions of FiberNet, Wilcon and Lightower that operate in top U.S. markets where we see the greatest demand for network investment by our customers. These investments reflect our strong belief that owning fiber is fundamental to delivering small cell solutions to our customers in a period of significantly increasing cell site densification. Our belief is informed by our significant experience building 50,000 small cell nodes, which is why we now own approximately 60,000 route miles of fiber, including in 23 of the top 25 markets in the U.S. We believe these capital allocation decisions will drive significant long-term growth in our dividend per share as we add small cell and fiber solutions customers to these high-capacity metro fiber assets. ","Turning to 2018. We increased our outlook for site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA to reflect 2 long-term customer agreements signed during the quarter. These agreements included contracted new leasing activity and term extensions on existing leases. We continue to see increasing levels of investment activity from our major customers that is resulting in an expected increase in 2018 new leasing activity across towers, small cells and fiber solutions as compared to the new leasing activity we saw in 2017. ","As we look beyond 2018, we're excited by the opportunity we see ahead to leverage our unique portfolio of assets to drive long-term growth as our customers make significant investments to keep pace with the rapid growth in data demand. ","With mobile data demand expected to double every 2 years, we see this level of network investment across towers and small cells continuing for years to come. Similar to the wireless industry, the expected 20% annual growth in wired data traffic is driving additional demand across our dense metro fiber assets. To meet this demand, our strategy is to provide differentiated fiber solutions that serve high-bandwidth, multi-location customers such as large enterprise, health care providers and educational institutions. This strategy allows us to enhance our competitive position in small cells by increasing the opportunities we serve with the underlying fiber assets, thereby improving the already attractive shared economic model we see in our small cell business. ","Importantly, we have underwritten our fiber investments based on existing applications, and the development of future technologies has the potential to further extend the runway of growth. Emerging technologies, including 5G, autonomous vehicles augmented or virtual reality and Internet of Things applications, will require mission-critical network infrastructure that provides availability anywhere at any time on any device. ","Looking out over the next decade, we expect our customers will increasingly rely on a hyper dense network of towers and small cells connected by high-capacity fiber to provide these new services, which require faster speeds and significantly lower latency. With our distributed real estate of more than 40,000 towers, 50,000 small cells on air under contract and approximately 60,000 route miles of high-capacity fiber, we believe Crown Castle is in a unique position to benefit from these trends longer term. ","While businesses globally are trying to emulate companies like Uber, who are driving efficiencies by sharing resources, we have shown for 2 decades that the sharing of our infrastructure across multiple parties provides the lowest cost and fastest time-to-market for our customers while delivering compelling financial returns for our company. While we have positioned Crown Castle for the future, we remain focused on consistently delivering value to our shareholders by converting the demand for our assets into growth in dividends. Our ability to consistently generate near-term operating performance and shareholder returns while investing in the future growth of our company is a testament to the quality of our business, assets and people, and we believe it sets us apart. ","Our focus on creating value for shareholders has resulted in a 14% compound annual growth in AFFO per share since we adopted that metric in 2007. Over that same period, we have delivered a 13% total annual return, more than doubling that of the S&P 500. ","Looking forward, Crown Castle remains a compelling investment opportunity. We are focused on generating attractive near-term returns for our shareholders, consisting of a high-quality dividend that we expect to grow 7% to 8% annually, while investing in assets and capabilities we believe are necessary to convert data demand growth into cash flow growth for decades to come. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.","Daniel Schlanger","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Our solid fourth quarter results punctuated another very successful year for Crown Castle on several fronts. We increased our dividend per share by 8%, reflecting the underlying growth in our business and our commitment to return capital to shareholders. We further extended our leadership position in the U.S. as a shared infrastructure provider of choice with continued investment in our assets, including the acquisitions of FiberNet, Wilcon and Lightower. And we managed this while proactively improving our balance sheet flexibility, increasing the average maturity on our debt, lowering our average interest rate and reducing our leverage. ","Turning first to fourth quarter 2017 results on Slide 4. I want to walk through a few items that should be considered when comparing the results to our prior outlook, including the Lightower acquisition that closed earlier than expected on November 1 and was not included in that outlook. When compared to prior outlook, Lightower contributed approximately $140 million, $83 million and $79 million to site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, respectively. Backing out the incremental contribution from Lightower, fourth quarter site rental revenues would have been $910 million, adjusted EBITDA would have been $624 million, and AFFO would have been $433 million. Additionally, site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA benefited from approximately $5 million of straight-line impacts associated with the customer agreements that Jay mentioned earlier. And finally, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO were impacted by approximately $10 million of costs associated with additional accruals for annual bonuses relating to our 2017 outperformance as well as some severance-related expenses that were not included in our prior outlook. ","When considering the impact of these items, fourth quarter and full year 2017 results were within the ranges provided in our prior outlook for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. For the full year 2017, site rental revenues increased approximately 13% or $436 million as compared to full year 2016, including approximately 5% growth in organic contribution to site rental revenues. ","Moving on to investment activities during the year. We invested approximately $9 billion in acquisitions and approximately $1.2 billion in capital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $85 million of sustaining capital expenditures. ","From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to improve our financial flexibility while focusing on maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. We ended the year at approximately 5.3x leverage pro forma for a full quarter's contribution from Lightower, which is down nearly 0.5 turn in the past 6 months. ","We also continue to proactively extend maturities while reducing our borrowing costs. Following our successful bond offering earlier this month, the weighted average term remaining on our debt is approximately 6.5 years, with an average interest cost of under 4%. Additionally, we have approximately $3 billion of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. ","Turning now to Slide 5. We increased our outlook for site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA by approximately $36 million due to the straight-line revenues associated with the customer agreements that Jay referenced earlier. ","Turning to Slide 6. We expect between $910 million and $955 million of growth in site rental revenues from 2017 to 2018. As you can see on the slide, when compared to the prior outlook, there are no changes to either the organic contribution to site rental revenues or the contribution to growth from acquisitions in 2018. Looking at the far right side, the expected growth in site rental revenues is approximately $30 million higher when compared to the prior outlook, which is related to the higher straight-line revenues I just discussed. ","Turning now to Slide 7. You can see the 2018 outlook for AFFO growth remains unchanged at $360 million to $400 million. As a result, the 2018 outlook for AFFO per share at the midpoint is also unchanged at $5.50, representing approximately 10% growth when compared to 2017 AFFO per share after adjusting for the impact of Lightower and related financing transactions. ","To wrap up, 2017 was a very successful year for Crown Castle, and we remain excited about the opportunity to generate significant growth in cash flows across our asset portfolio and deliver on our 7% to 8% annual growth target in dividends per share. ","With that, April, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we'll first hear from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery","I wonder if you could sort of characterize the level of activity around the applications. Obviously, you haven't got the leases signed to put, say, FirstNet into your guidance yet, but how are the application volumes generally compared to, say, this time last year? And then if there's any KPIs or anything you could share with us on the small cell and fiber business to get a better look under the hood there, appreciate that.","Jay Brown","Sure, Simon. We mentioned this, I believe, last quarter as well and continuing to see this play itself out. As we look at the activity around towers, small cells and fiber solutions, the activity that we would expect in full year 2018 is greater than what we experienced during full year 2017. And they're early days. I mean, we're just now a couple of weeks into January, and our experience so far has been consistent with that expectation as we came into this year. So we've seen increase in activity across all 3 areas.","Simon Flannery","Okay. And anything you can do -- give us in terms of, say, the lease-up on the fiber and the small cell side per node, et cetera? I know you've given some of that color in the past.","Jay Brown","Now what we've seen in terms of leasing the fiber for small cells continues to be at a pace of about twice what our historical experience has been for towers. So as we were previously adding and have for a long period of time in the neighborhood of about 1 tenant per tower over a 10-year period of time on the tower side, we're going at about twice that pace as we've seen lease-up on small cells. So directionally, we're continuing to see the sharing of the asset and the resulting economics pace -- at a pace faster than what we've historically seen on the towers side.","Daniel Schlanger","And the only other thing I'd add on that, Simon, is that our pipeline for small cell nodes does continue to creep up a little bit even as we are delivering certain nodes within a quarter or period. So we're still seeing good activity across the board.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from David Barden of Bank of America.","David Barden","I guess the first one is just on the long-term contract extensions and the new business that got done in the fourth quarter. I guess some industry chatter out there suggests that maybe the terms and conditions are changing around that, specifically around escalators. I was wondering if you could kind of just address kind of what the contracts' kind of terms and conditions look like relative to history. And then second, I guess, Dan or Jay, last quarter, when you were talking about the guide-up of, I think, about $190 million to $220 million, you broke it down into towers, fiber and small cells. I think towers was $110 million, and fiber and small cells were roughly half each of the balance. Could you kind of revisit that? Is that still the same? And then could you kind of talk about the churn and how each of those 3 buckets are contributing to the churn numbers that we're looking at here in the guide for 2018?","Jay Brown","Thanks, Dave. On your first question, we're not going to get into the specifics of what we did around these agreements for obvious reasons. On the wireless side, there's obviously four customers. So we're going to maintain sort of our historical practice of not commenting directly. But I think directly in answer to a part of your question, though, that as we extended the terms, the escalations remained the same. So broadly, in the pricing environment that we have seen, and we've talked about this, I think, over the last several quarters, the pricing environment, whether it's for new leases, amendments to leases or the underlying base escalator on those contracts, we've not seen any change in the pricing environment. And I think that's reflected in the leasing activity and the growth in revenues that we've been showing on an organic basis.","Daniel Schlanger","So to get at the second part of your question there, David, the breakdown of our new leasing activity between towers, small cells and fiber solutions haven't changed any. It's still $110 million at towers, $55 million at small cells and $45 million at fiber solutions. So we still see, like I said before, really good activity across the board, and I think that it's going to continue to translate into new leasing activity, as we did in our prior outlook. In regard to churn, we're about 1% to 2% on the towers side, and we think that that's a pretty good long-term view of what the churn is and pretty good for what would be in 2018. On small cells, it's in the same ballpark, 1% to 2%. And then on the fiber solutions business, it's in the upper single digits on a per-year basis as a percentage of revenues. And that really hasn't changed much either on our expectation for our outlook or longer term.","David Barden","Okay, great. And just one follow-up on that, Dan. I noticed you guys took out the disclosure in the supplemental regarding the churn related to the Clearwire, Leap and PCS. Can we still look back at last quarter's disclosures? And kind of is that still the same? Or is that -- any major changes in that?","Daniel Schlanger","There haven't been any, really, major changes. The reason we did that is that was -- to try to get some insight into a multiyear period of increased churn in the acquired networks. And where we are now, where the tower churn is back in the 1% or 2% range, we don't think it adds a lot of benefit to stay where -- what it is. We think that 1% to 2% range is good for a longer-term basis, so no real reason to continue to break out specific acquired network, but there's no change either from what we've disclosed last time.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","It's obviously good to hear that the funnel of small cell nodes continues to grow. During this earnings season, we've heard from one of your large customers who's doing a lot of fiber, and they've indicated they're increasingly less interested in using leased fiber solutions because they're looking to deploy fiber that has multiple use cases for themselves. And so they feel like doing it themselves is a better option. Could you maybe talk a bit about how your customers are using your fiber, why you feel confident that you have assets in the right places? And are you actually finding that some of your tenants are, indeed, using your fiber for more than one reason? Or is this still very much targeted towards small cell solutions?","Jay Brown","Sure, Brett. I would say across all four of the operators, we're seeing them use the asset in multiple different ways, so not just for small cells but, as we've talked about, some of the other offerings that we have on the fiber solutions side. Those are products that they're interested in and are using in various ways. To the question of the addressable market, which I think really goes into the heart of your question, we certainly don't anticipate or expect that as the usage continues to grow and site densification continues and use of small cells becomes increasingly important to some of the comments that I made in my prepared remarks, the carriers are going to self perform some portion of the need for small cells. We believe the addressable market here for small cells and the pie, so to speak, is expanding rapidly and is going to continue to expand.","We're going to own fiber in places where we think there's economic returns of sharing it across multiple parties. Our experience to date had shown that the carriers want to share it because it is their lowest cost and fastest time-to-market. And on top of that, we're going to see carriers, I think, invest and self perform, and we'll probably have other infrastructure providers come into the market and provide solutions in places where we don't. So I take-- and I don't believe it's just one carrier who's saying. There's multiple carriers in the market talking about how big the opportunity here is for small cells, and the need for fiber is core to that. So I think you're going to continue to see others beyond just us invest in fiber and then use that fiber for things like small cells.","Operator","Matthew Niknam of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Niknam","Just two, if I could. First, on FirstNet, I think one of your peers has actually talked about starting to see applications for FirstNet activity. You mentioned in last night's release your guide is unchanged. If you could just maybe give us some high-level comments or update on how you think FirstNet could impact your business in '18. And then secondly, on tax reform, just wondering if you've seen any change in plans or tone from customers, whether it's wireless customers or enterprise customers, on the fiber side in light of corporate tax reform late last year.","Jay Brown","On the first question, we obviously noted in the press release and mentioned in our remarks that we did not include impact of FirstNet into our outlook for 2018. I'll pass on commenting on what I think the potential impacts could be. We obviously believe that FirstNet will ultimately be deployed, and we believe that will be positively impacting our growth characteristics once it does turn. And if we have visibility and update to that, we'll certainly let you know when we know. On the second question, I don't know how to tie it directly to tax reform. I think to the comments that we've made, we're certainly expecting across towers, small cells and fiber solutions that we're going to see increased investments. And that's what's driving the increase in our expected leasing activity across all 3 of those areas, but we need to -- we'd need to probably talk to our customers about what's driving that. I don't know whether it's tied directly to the tax reform or, more broadly, kind of the secular trends that we've talked about with increasing usage by the consumer, which is driving the need for network investment.","Operator","Ric Prentiss of Raymond James has our next question.","Richard Prentiss","A couple of questions. I think a follow-up on David's. You mentioned the breakdown of the new leasing activity between tower, fiber, small cells. Can you help us understand the escalator -- and you did that with churn as well. Can you help us understand maybe the different dynamics of escalators on those 3 segments?","Daniel Schlanger","Sure. I can do that. All right. On the towers side, the escalator is still in the 3% range generally is what we're looking at. On small cells, it's generally about half of that on a per-year basis. And on the fiber solutions business, there really isn't any escalator at all.","Richard Prentiss","Okay. And then with Lightower closing earlier, nice to see the deal done, that means I would expect in November, December of 2018 any activity will move into the new leasing activity. So just wondering, should we be expecting a change? Because that was unchanged, I think, from initial guidance to new guidance. Should we think that there could be a movement to the higher end of the leasing activity and maybe the higher end of churn now that Lightower will have 2 months out of the newbuild acquisition category?","Jay Brown","Yes, Ric. Our attempt given the change in timing and the movement that that had on the numbers, we were trying to keep things simple. So I think our plan, and as we go through the course of the year, maybe we'll rethink this, but our current plan was for calendar year 2018 to just leave the disclosure and the plan the same. So for all of '18, we leave new leasing from Lightower in the acquired bucket. And then as we roll into 2019, that would move from acquisitions over to the new leasing activity. That was our current plan. We thought that was a little more streamlined and simple in terms of understanding, so we didn't have too many moving pieces.","Richard Prentiss","That makes sense. I think when you provided initial Lightower guidance, you said here's what you thought calendar '18 would be anyway, right?","Jay Brown","Correct. That's correct.","Richard Prentiss","Okay. All right. And then one other question. I appreciate the sensitivity on the long-term contracts not to get into -- was it escalators or pricing, but clearly, the carrier wants to get something out of it. You guys want to get something out of it. So should we expect that one of your asks would have been long-term contracts help us mitigate any longer-term churn? And was that done thinking about potential for M&A down the road or potential overbuilding? Just trying to think of -- obviously, two parties came at the table. Both sides wanted to make sure the economics work. Kind of help us understand what, on your side, you wanted to make sure you achieved out of that.","Jay Brown","I think probably, fundamental to the conversation is our belief that when you look at the macro tower sites, as we have seen for several decades, those macro tower sites don't move. So we obviously value long-term extensions, which are reflected in the results as we push the escalator out over longer periods of time and has the uplift to site rental revenues associated with that straight-line impact. But we certainly don't believe, over the long term, that the carriers are going to move macro tower sites. So we would assume, in due course, leases on macro tower sites get extended, and that would not be a big driver in terms of our thinking of value that's traded there. That value is kind of near to the asset over a long period of time regardless of when ultimately you roll into the next term renewal. Around leasing activity, we just value what is going to go on the site and what's the price of that space that's being used and type of equipment that's going to be put on the tower and then run that out in order to figure out how to price any given contract.","And we've talked about this over a long period of time. Whether it's committed or not committed, the value of doing some of these is that it gives some certainty and some line of sight to the carriers and reduces some paperwork, which, in turn, creates a little bit more speed for them. And so we found this to be valuable at points in time given the right set of circumstances and, in this case, the same thing. But I'll go back to the point I'd said earlier. We carried forward the base escalators and haven't seen anything changing in the broader pricing environment around the way we're pricing new leases, amendments or escalations in the contracts.","Richard Prentiss","And the moat, if you will, of the tower is still holding as well as far as protected good asset, not worried about the overbuilding.","Jay Brown","Not at all. The barriers to entry in this business are extremely high. And once the investment has been embedded into an individual site, it is -- it becomes a part of a designed network. And we see that very stable and have seen it over multiple renewals across multiple carriers for a long period of time.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.","Michael Rollins","Could you talk a bit about what the specific tower organic site leasing growth rate was for the fourth quarter and maybe put that into perspective with where you see the industry right now?","Daniel Schlanger","The fourth quarter was around 5% on the tower side, and I think it's in line generally with what the industry is doing. I think we're seeing our fair share of the activity given our portfolio of 40,000 assets across the U.S. And we think that that's going to continue for the end of 2018 and then beyond because, as Jay was mentioning, our carrier customers are investing to try to keep pace with the demand that's coming. We think our assets are extremely well positioned to benefit from that. And I think that is also reflected on these agreements that we were just talking about a second ago, is that all of those characteristics of our business come out with our customers continuing to renew with us at the terms that we've seen and at the activity levels that are increasing as we're seeing this growth in demand.","Michael Rollins","And what's in your minds, if you look at the growth of your small cell and fiber business, what's the biggest constraint for that to grow faster? Is it just getting the booking? Is it just the time and labor to get small cells built? Is it capital? If you had to kind of rank order where you see things that may hold back growth in that business relative to sort of the broader commentary on small cells and fiber.","Jay Brown","Well, it feels like the growth is running pretty fast at the moment, so it doesn't feel constrained. And I think that's reflected in kind of the numbers that we're talking about in terms of the growth that we're seeing with small cells and fiber. I would tell you, really big picture, if you go up 40,000 feet, we have a combination of 2 things that are happening around our fiber plant currently. There's a mix of the leasing that's going on that's related to adding additional, whether it's fiber solutions or small cells, to the assets that we've owned for a period of time and have built. And then there's activity that's driving revenue related to building new fiber plant. To the extent that we get orders from customers to go into markets that we don't have existing fiber or there's not existing fiber in that market for us to utilize, then we go down the path of constructing new networks there. And as we talked about that build cycle for us, it's about a two-year build cycle from start to finish.","So some of the point that Dan was making earlier around us continuing to see the pipeline for new small cells continuing to build, some of those are going on fiber that's existing for which we can expeditiously get those tenants on the fiber. And then some of this is we're continuing to expand our footprint, and that's a 2-year cycle. So we're continuing -- to the points that I made in my comments earlier, we're continuing to expand what is the future opportunity as we're building additional assets. And by far, if you're really at a high-level talk about what's the biggest constraint to growth, it's the time it takes to own enough assets, but then you benefit from step 2, which is going back and adding additional leases to that existing footprint. And then at that point, you'll start to see the benefit of the returns as the assets age and we're able to incrementally add revenues to that existing plan.","Operator","Colby Synesael of Cowen.","Colby Synesael","Regarding the two long-term agreements that you signed in the quarter, I was curious if those included the opportunity for those two companies to add additional cell sites on Crown towers where they may not currently reside. And therefore, is that already reflected in, I guess, the step-up we saw in [indiscernible]? Or is it included, at least, in your new leasing activity guidance? And then secondly, when I look at the Lightower revenues in the fourth quarter, if you just kind of try to assume a full quarter benefit, call it, about $210 million of revenue or $840 million on an annualized basis versus your guidance of $850 million to $870 million for 2018, it seems like if you're going to be growing at high-single digits, which is what you've stated that business should be doing, that your $850 million to $870 million guidance is actually pretty conservative. And I'm just trying to make sure I'm looking at the numbers correctly.","Jay Brown","Colby, on your first comment, again, we're hesitant to get into any specifics around the lease agreements that we signed with our customers for lots of reasons. So I'm probably going to beg off to...","Colby Synesael","Can I ask you differently then? Because...","Jay Brown","Yes, go ahead.","Colby Synesael","Typically, when you sign a holistic agreement, assume in that additional cell sites? Or is it typically just focused on amendments of current cell sites?","Jay Brown","I think what I would describe it as, generally, when we're talking to the customers, they're focused on trying to understand what the cost of a certain activity is, and then we're trying to give them the clarity of that, and then they're trying to go for speed. In most cases, the clarity and the speed element of why they would be interested in doing that would relate to locations where they already are because they have more of a sense of where their network is and what needs to happen to that network. So again, I don't want to speak specifically to the circumstances of these, but generically, I would tell you it's more likely to be related to amendment activities than it would be new leases. But if a customer wanted to come to us and commit to certain levels of new leasing activity, we'd certainly be open to talking to them about that conversation.","So again, I don't want to get into specifics about what we did or didn't do, but we'd be open to both. With regards to Lightower, I think you've done the math correctly, or you've repeated the numbers that we've given accurately. So we'll see how the year plays out and then update based on our performance and what our outlook is for future periods.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Jonathan Atkin of RBC.","Jonathan Atkin","So a couple of things. I was interested in just sort of the traditional enterprise fiber business going back to, say, Sunesys and how that has trended and then perspectively or how things are going kind of on the Lightower side and broader just kind of the non-telecom -- or the non-mobile infrastructure fiber assets and how to think about the growth out there. And then secondly, I was interested in your thoughts on the DISH spectrum and opportunities for seeing some activity on your towers from that deployment.","Jay Brown","Now on the first question, the activity that we've seen, whether you go back and look at Sunesys or Wilcon, FiberNet, others, had been in line with what we talked about with regards to our expectations around Lightower. And I've talked about it a couple of times on the call this morning. We've seen that play out over the period of time that we've owned the assets both in terms of the new leasing activity as well as the churn levels. And the financial returns on incremental investment of capital around that business has played out in line with what our expectations have been and in line with what we're talking about with regards to Lightower specifically. ","On your second question around DISH, again, I don't want to get into any specific customers, and so I won't speak to the conversations that we're having with them. I would tell you, broadly, we haven't included anything in our 2018 outlook related to the deployment of that spectrum. There is a meaningful amount of spectrum that's lying fallow in the hands of various potential users of wireless network. Some of those -- some of that spectrum have periods of time that starts to come to fruition here in the next couple of years, where, in order to maintain the license, the spectrum has to be deployed and developed on towers. We think we'll benefit from the deployment of that spectrum as it's deployed in the coming years, but it's not included in our 2018 outlook.","Daniel Schlanger","And Jon, I think it just plays into the overall theme that we're talking about, which is to meet the demand and the growth in demand that we're seeing and what our customers are seeing. They're going to look to using more spectrum, densifying the network and using as much technology as they can. And no matter how that plays out, we're in position to take advantage of it. So we're just looking out and seeing that all the trends are moving in the right direction. And whether DISH, like you're talking about specifically, or anybody else is going to use more spectrum or cell densification or newer technologies is going to play to our benefit.","Jonathan Atkin","And then on the last call, we discussed a little bit vapor IO. Is there any update that you can provide on that project?","Jay Brown","Well, we're continuing to do some work in trials at the edge. To the point that I made earlier around towers and small cells being connected with high-capacity fiber, a part of that is driven by the need to push computing tower to the very edge of the network. So we're continuing to see opportunities to trial activities and learn about that business. We believe that part of the driver of the devices that are going to be used, whether it's augmented reality, virtual reality, autonomous cars, a lot of the Internet of Things applications, the latency required in order to make those devices work effectively is going to require not only high-speed fiber, dense fiber networks and close proximity to the locations where they are distributed from things like small cells, but it's also going to require computing power at the very edge of the network. So we're continuing to work on that. We believe that will be a long-term driver of the need for our infrastructure, and so we're still in the learning and trial phase.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson.","Nicholas Del Deo","First, it looks like new leasing activity in the quarter was a bit shy of the expectation you laid out in the third quarter, with full year new leasing activity coming at $166 million versus $172 million midpoint you indicated last quarter. Can you give some detail around what might have happened, if it was in any way related to the extensions you signed or if there's anything else we should bear in mind?","Daniel Schlanger","Yes. Nick, what happened there is we typically have some -- at the end of the year, some -- in every quarter some nonrecurring or cleanup-type items that come in. That includes things like back billing for periods in the past and things of that nature, and we just didn't see that in the fourth quarter this year. So that's what caused that $6 million reduction. But as you can see, when you look at 2018, we have everything that is remaining the same both in terms of the new leasing activity and the overall growth in revenues for organic site contribution, site rental revenues and otherwise. And so it didn't impact the jumping off point in order to impact the 2018 guidance.","Nicholas Del Deo","Okay, got it. That's helpful. And second, now that you've owned Lightower for almost three months, I mean, still a short period of time, but you've kind of been able to look under the hood. Can you talk about anything you might have encountered or observed that you didn't expect, whether positive surprises or maybe some challenges? And can you also touch on management retention?","Jay Brown","Sure. So far, from an operating results expectation and as well as the outlook, everything is in line with what our expectations were as we went through the diligence period. As you know, we get the best -- these questions a lot about the team. And if you remember, when we announced the transaction, we didn't assume or model any synergies associated with any of these transitions. And a great -- as we look at the team, we have a great deal of respect for what they've been able to build and develop as a business over a long period of time. And I would put into this category not just the Lightower team but each of the fiber acquisitions that we've done over the last several years. And our experience has been, with each of the acquisitions, including, most recently, Lightower, these acquisitions bring with them a tremendous amount of talent and experience and insight into the business. ","And so we're planning to grow and build those businesses because we think the platforms that they have and the markets in which they operate are valuable and able to be expanded. And the revenue synergy here of us being able to add that kind of activity across not just the 30,000 miles of fiber that came from each of those -- from the totality of those fiber companies but the 30,000 miles of fiber that we brought to the mix has an extraordinary amount of potential revenue synergies there, and so we're looking to capture that opportunity. So we're working hard at the moment to welcome about 900 new employees to Crown Castle and talk to them about why Crown Castle is a great place to be and why there's a lot of opportunity for them personally to work on the opportunity ahead for us as a company. So I know probably a bunch of them are listening to the call this morning, and we're certainly glad to have them and hope that they'll stay for a long period of time and help us build the business that I was articulating earlier in the call.","Operator","Phil Cusick of JPMorgan has our next question.","Yong Choe","This is Richard for Phil. I wanted to follow up on the long-term contracts, the activity and extensions. One, were these one-offs? And two, how long does it take to put these together? Can they come together pretty quickly? Then I have another follow-up.","Jay Brown","Yes. Richard, again, I don't think we're going to comment specifically on the customer agreements. So we're in constant dialogue, as you would expect, with each of our customers, and these things develop as they do in the normal course of conversation.","Yong Choe","And then, I guess, the tower services business seems to have picked up a little bit. Is that indicative of what we should expect kind of going forward? Or is the activity more in-quarter? Or is it kind of showing that tower growth in the future can ramp?","Jay Brown","The services business is tied to new leasing activity, and leasing activity, as we're suggesting in 2018, slightly up on the tower side from 2017. Generally, that is directionally followed by the services business.","Operator","Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski","I wanted to touch upon or go back to some of the prior questions around how you're looking at sort of co-location opportunities versus self-fulfillment. We've seen a number of announcements in which carriers, one in particular, are working with cable providers in order to provide additional densification. One, do you see that as a -- does that fall into the banner of sort of the self-fulfillment opportunity that you guys mentioned? And obviously, you folks have made very strong investments into the fiber world. Do you believe that those types of assets can provide the necessary backhaul capacity that you expect to need to support the kind of traffic growth that you're expecting down the future?","Jay Brown","Sure, Amir. I would say that, that's an example of self-fulfillment, where the carriers are looking for opportunities given the scale and number of small cells that are coming and the investment that's going to have to happen around cell site densification. I believe you're going to see them search for and find a number of different partnerships. And that is an example of a party that's providing capital, and they're using it to deploy small cells and would be an example of what I was speaking to earlier around self-performing the deployment of small cells.","Amir Rozwadowski","Okay. That's helpful. And then one follow-up, if I may. I think last spring or summer, there was a notable pickup in discussions around various technology or Silicon Valley types that we're looking at, how they could leverage your assets. Any update there on any potential developments that have taken place or any color that you can provide?","Jay Brown","Well, in the litany of things that I mentioned, whether it's autonomous cars, virtual and augmented reality, Internet of Things across virtually every business and all industry, people are looking to utilize wireless as a means by finding cost efficiencies inside of their business. And so the conversations have continued with many of the parties that we talked about last year and broadened. And I think we like where we're positioned, where our infrastructure sits in that ecosystem because the infrastructure is necessary for any of those devices to ultimately work and fulfill their function. What's exciting to us is, in most cases, the applications that are being looked at, they require faster speeds and lower latency, which -- there's two ways to solve that, additional spectrum can be owned, for which that's a very limited resource; and additional infrastructure across which to deploy that spectrum.","And we sit in a very good place on the infrastructure side of that as the carriers want to deploy spectrum. In order to provide not just carriers but more broadly, as people look to try to figure out how we can get consumers to use devices that have lower latency and greater speeds, the infrastructure is required to accomplish that. So we feel like we sit in a sweet spot there from fiber and towers because both are going to be necessary in order to provide those kind of services to the consumer.","Daniel Schlanger","And I think importantly, on the fiber side, we do see that, that is a differentiator there in that -- one of your questions around whether the existing fiber could withstand all of the demand that's coming, I think it's pretty clear from our actions. We don't believe so because what we're looking for is to continue to add dense deep metro fiber in the top markets in the U.S. because we don't see that what's there now is going to be able to carry all of the data that's going to be required to move -- to get these applications to people wherever they are. So we feel really good about our investment and what it looks like going forward because of that.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Spencer Kurn of New Street Research.","Spencer Kurn","So Sprint has recently signed two deals with Altice and Cox to leverage their backhaul infrastructure for small cells. I just want to get your impression on any thoughts around how these agreements impact your view on the lease-up potential for your -- the fiber that you've been acquiring.","Jay Brown","I would take it as testimony against my PowerPoint that it means that small cells are necessary, and there's going to be a lot of them, and carriers are going to use self-perform and multiple co-location infrastructure providers to do that. So I think it's a testimony of exactly all the things that we've been saying on the call and have for several years now that small cells are going to be needed by all carriers across all markets, and there's going to be a lot of them.","Daniel Schlanger","And also a validation that the fiber-fed small cell is the preferred method at this point given the data that's going to have to be moved across the small cell network. So I think that what it shows, like Jay is saying, is there's a lot of activity. Most of it's going to be fiber-fed or fiber backhaul, and we're in the best position, we think, in the markets where we have that fiber to take up that lease-up opportunity. But we'll always see that our customers will look at various alternatives. There's just too much work to go around to expect that we're going to get all of it more than we want to necessarily. So we're working with our customers to try to figure out where we make the most sense and understand there are going to be places where that may not be true.","Spencer Kurn","Got it. And just one follow-up, if I may. Have you had many discussions around using your infrastructure for fixed wireless broadband with any of your customers?","Jay Brown","We have had that conversation, yes.","Operator","Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.","Timothy Horan","Just back to the Verizon question on the fiber. I guess Verizon's kind of arguing they're using a new generation of passive optical technology with multiple wavelengths and a lot more speeds. And they don't want to just serve the wireless market. They want to serve multiple markets. They also want to have kind of unique infrastructure, that they feel, historically, if they have unique infrastructure, they can create -- sell new services and gain market share. And I guess there's also some questions the cable -- separately, the cable companies are basically saying they have unique power at the edges of the network that are difficult for other people to kind of replicate what they have. I guess just curious, can your network support that type of service offering that Verizon's talking about as it's currently structured either the fiber or the conduits? And how do you argue against the uniqueness that they're kind of looking for?","Jay Brown","Yes. I think I would go back to the basic premise of our business is that our carrier customers as well as, more broadly, all customers, they're looking for the lowest-cost solution, and they want it as fast to market as possible. We're not going to be the infrastructure builder of fiber everywhere in the United States. We have focused -- as we've talked about, the vast majority of our investment has been in kind of the top 25 markets. We've got significant plants in 23 of the top 25 markets in the U.S., and we are very well positioned to provide that fiber at a -- on a very timely basis at a very attractive cost profile to the customers. And I believe you will see, over a long period of time, that low cost and speed will win, as it has on the tower side and on the small cell side for a period of time. With regards to the technologies that are put at either end of the fiber, we're building high-capacity fiber. So there are numerous strands and lots of capacity on the fiber that we're putting in the ground. ","And if we get to the point where we've filled up and used up all of the fiber that we're putting in, the returns that we will have achieved on that basis will be in excess of what we're underwriting, and then it will be a great outcome for our company and for our shareholders. So I feel like we're well positioned for what's coming.","Timothy Horan","And Jay, just a follow-up. Can you just compare how this leasing activity for either LTE advanced 5G compares to the original LTE buildouts a few years ago? Maybe what stage are we in? Do you think it will progress in kind of a similar way that we ramped up for a couple of years?","Jay Brown","In the 3G, 4G environment, if you try to compare that to 5G today, it's difficult to make the comparison. One, we're at the conversation stage around 5G, so we don't believe hardly any of the activity that we're currently seeing is really 5G-related. We underwrote the world and our investments, as I talked about earlier, based on existing applications, which would be 4G wireless world, and did not project what 5G could mean. In a 5G environment, the densification that's required is a stairstep change from what has happened in the past. Most of what happened when we went from 3G to 4G was around increasing some capacity in the network by adding additional cell sites, but most of the activity actually occurred on the sites where they're already existing, and we saw additional co-location on new tower sites. The densification that's, at least, envisaged in a 5G world requires not just macro sites but additional sites in the form of small cells that fill in and increase the overall capacity of the network.","And that's very different than anything we've ever seen in any of the technology moves from 1G to 2G, 3G, 4G. We believe, fundamentally, the infrastructure is going to change as we move into a 5G world, and we're seeing the benefit of that in 4G. If 5G ultimately comes to fruition like we believe it will, we've positioned the company to benefit in the same way with small cells and fiber that we benefited over the last couple of decades from the macro tower investments that we made.","Operator","Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc.","Brandon Nispel","Dan, I'm wondering if it makes -- if you think about the business and how you're segmenting it now, that it makes sense to break up the fiber and small cell segment from a reporting standpoint to help investors get a better view on the business. It seems like there's certainly different characteristics between the customer bases and the churn. And then maybe another question. What percentage of total capital investments do you think carriers are going to spend on macro versus small cells -- macro towers versus small cells today? And where does it go in the future? I mean, Verizon essentially guided to flat CapEx year-over-year but also has plans for a significant fiber build. I'm just trying to get a sense of how the mix could shift over time.","Daniel Schlanger","Yes. Thanks, Brandon. I'll start with the first question. The key to our business is actually the asset that underlies the services we provide, and that asset is towers and fiber. And so what we're going to do going forward is what we've done up to date, which is give more color around the revenue source because we can break that up pretty easily between small cells and fiber. But once you get past that, it's hard to break anything else out because we're using the same asset to deliver a very similar service to multiple customers. So what we're trying to do, as Jay pointed out, that it works so well on towers, you just leverage that infrastructure again and again. So we actually believe that the appropriate breakdown of this business is what we've done now, which is towers and fiber, and we don't see that changing going forward. What we will continue to do is give more color, like we have, around the revenue, the new leasing activity, the escalators and churn associated with each of the towers, fiber solutions and small cell businesses to try to get more color for investors to be able to see.","Jay Brown","To your second question, the investment, you can look at our operating results, as we've mentioned a couple of times on the call, around new leasing activity. New leasing activity around towers in calendar year 2018 is about $110 million is what our expectation is for the year. Small cells is about $55 million of new leasing activity in 2018. I don't want to give any expectation beyond calendar year 2018, but we do expect there's going to continue to be meaningful investment and leasing activity across both components of our business, both towers and small cells, for a long period of time. And I think at a minimum, one of the things that you could read into are customer agreements that we talked about. We talked about, from a pricing environment, the pricing environment continues. The escalation provisions are carried forward on the same terms, that the sites that are being used by the carriers today are going to continue to need to be used for a long period of time and into the future, and there's more activity coming on them to the point that they're willing to contract and commit to that. So I think you will continue to see strong activity across both segments, the growth rates, as we've talked about, being higher on small cells than they are on towers.","Daniel Schlanger","I think one of the benefits of our company as we've set ourselves up to where -- if that mix changes from year to year, it doesn't really impact our business positively or negatively because we're getting a good portion of them. So we feel like -- we're talking about earlier, however our customers choose to try to improve their networks to meet their demand, that we're positioned to get that spend. And that's what I think has been kind of a unique position that we put Crown Castle in.","Operator","Robert Gutman of Guggenheim.","Robert Gutman","In the fourth quarter, we saw construction CapEx jump up meaningfully to $336 million. That's like 40% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. What was driving that? And does it reset to a lower rate going forward? Or will it stay at an elevated -- relatively elevated level?","Jay Brown","Robert, that construction business tends to be heavily weighted towards the back half of the year. So part of what you saw in the quarter-over-quarter moves in calendar year 2017, I would tell you it's not an unreasonable expectation. As you look at the business, I would expect later quarters in the year to have more CapEx than earlier quarters, just generally speaking. The move year-over-year has to do with the scale of the business and how much bigger our business is because of the amount of activity. As a forecast for what to expect going forward, it's really going to come down to how much activity you will see and how big is the pipeline of activity to be built in future periods. And if we see a meaningful step-up in terms of what that pipeline is and what that looks like, we'll certainly update you on that as we go.","Robert Gutman","And I've got one follow-up. I also noticed that the acquisition -- now with several months of Lightower under your control, it looks like you've lowered the acquisition and integration expense by about $19 million. I was just wondering what you've seen that underlies that.","Jay Brown","I think that's because a portion of it came in, in 2017, when we previously had expected it was all going to be in '18 because we weren't closing until January of 2018. So no change in overall dollars.","Operator","We'll take that from Batya Levi of UBS.","Batya Levi","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First, can you maybe provide a little bit more color on how much in total CapEx you're budgeting for this year? And maybe if you could break it into buckets. And the second question on Lightower integration. As you integrate the assets, are you finding any maybe synergy opportunities on the cost side, maybe procurement, best practices? And how long do you think that it would take to fully integrate the assets that you might be willing to look at more M&A opportunities?","Daniel Schlanger","Yes, Batya. Starting with the CapEx conversation. We're going to be, in '18, around $1.5 billion of CapEx. And what we've said, it'd be in the same neighborhood of what we've done historically in terms of land purchases and sustaining capital, so around $100 million each for those. It will be up a little bit on sustaining because we've incorporated Lightower in 2018 versus 2017. But as Jay pointed out earlier, majority of that is really going to be into building new assets and putting it into small cell deployments that we've been talking about to meet the pipeline that we have in place as well as to expand the fiber footprint with regard to the fiber solutions business.","Jay Brown","On your second question around synergies, we don't see any synergies at this point, to I think a question earlier on the call, around people. We may find, over time, if we integrate the asset and start to expand, that there are some cost synergies that we're able to achieve from suppliers and other sources. But our focus is really on the growth opportunity that is in front of us, and we believe the revenue synergies here are really the greatest opportunity in front. So we're focused on having conversations around how do we grow the business and capture the opportunity that's in front of us. And over time, we may find that there are some cost synergies, but we'd certainly expect, with regards to the people that we've gained over these various acquisitions, that there really are not any cost synergies there around people, which is a significant portion of the cost structure. With regards to future activities and investment, it's going to take us a little bit of time to invest -- to digest the assets that we've acquired, Lightower being the most recent large acquisition.","As I mentioned in the comments, we've done 2 other large acquisitions in 2017 that we're in the middle of integrating into the portfolio. So it's going to take us a little bit of time to digest. Our criteria in terms of how we think about assets and think that would be interesting to us has remained the same. We're focused on markets where we think we can share the asset across multiple parties. It needs to be high-capacity fiber in dense urban areas, and that is a relatively limited targeted set of assets. And I don't know that there will be another asset that will be of interest to us. But in the short term here, I think it we're going to be digesting the assets that we found. We're pleased with what we found so far and glad the assets are performing in line with our expectations as we went through diligence. ","Well, with that, I'll wrap up the call this morning. Appreciate everyone joining. Obviously, I want to thank all of our employees who worked incredibly hard over 2017 not only to deliver on the results that we delivered but also the significant activities that are going on related to the integration of the assets that we've acquired. Appreciate everyone's help on that and excited about what's in store for Crown Castle. Thanks so much.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

Brown","Thanks, Fiona, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our press release and as outlined on Slide 3, we had an excellent first quarter, exceeding the high end of our previously issued guidance for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. We continue to make good progress integrating the T-Mobile towers and expect to be substantially complete within the next few months. The strong year-to-date results from our site rental revenue business, together with the significant contribution from network services, in addition to a meaningful increase in applications to go on our sites, allow us to increase our 2013 outlook for site rental revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.","Turning to Slide 4, I'd like to highlight a few things from our first quarter results. During the first quarter, we generated site rental revenue of $615 million, up 24% or $118 million from the first quarter of 2012. Site rental and gross margin, defined as site rental revenues, less the cost of operations, was $438 million, up 17% from the first quarter of 2012.","Our services business performed very well, posting another record quarter, with the contribution from services gross margin increasing twofold year-over-year, from $23 million in the first quarter of 2012 to $47 million in the first quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2013 was $441 million, up 22% from the first quarter of 2012. AFFO was $291 million, up 47% from the first quarter of 2012, and $1 per share, up 45% from the first quarter of 2012.","The significant outperformance in the first quarter AFFO compared to our outlook, issued in January 2013, was primarily due to the outperformance in adjusted EBITDA that I mentioned, and approximately $8 million in contributions related to the construction of conduits, the whole customer-owned fiber to our towers. These contributions are accounted for as deferred site rental revenues and recognized over the estimated period the contributions are earned, which is currently about 8 years.","Turning to Slide 5, during the first quarter, we spent $116 million on capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $16 million in our land lease purchase program. Since we began this important effort, we have completed over 13,000 individual land transactions. As of today, we own or control for more than 20 years, the land beneath towers representing approximately 75% of our gross margin. We continue to enjoy significant success with this program, as evidenced by the fact that today, 37% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own, up from less than 15% in January of 2007. Further, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 32 years.","Of the remaining capital expenditures, we spent $7 million on sustaining capital expenditures, $94 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures, the latter consisting of $58 million on existing sites and $36 million on the construction of new sites. Additionally, we spent $13 million on acquisitions during the first quarter.","Also during the first quarter, we purchased approximately 300,000 of our common shares for $24 million. Since 2003, we have spent $2.8 billion to purchase approximately 101 million of our common shares and potential shares, equal to 1\/3 of the company's shares. All of this done at an average price of $27 per share.","During the first quarter, we chose to limit our discretionary investments, as we're assessing several potential acquisitions. While we have no assurances that we will be successful in any of these processes, the total value of these potential acquisitions would represent less than 3% of our total assets as of the end of this last quarter.","Consistent with our past practice, we evaluate these potential acquisitions on their expected long-term contribution to AFFO per share, compared to the purchase of our own common shares.","With regards our debt outstanding, we ended the first quarter of 2013 with total debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 6.1x and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense of 3.5x. In April, just a few weeks ago, we refinanced our existing $1.58 billion Term Loan B and effectively lower the rate on the loan by 75 basis points, saving approximately of $12 million in annual interest expense. Currently, the average coupon on our total debt outstanding is 4.5%, with an average maturity of 6.5 years.","Turning to our 2013 outlook, as shown on Slide 6, we expect site rental revenue of between $612 million and $617 million and adjusted EBITDA of between $426 million and $431 million for the second quarter of 2013. The sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from Q1 to Q2 in this year is impacted by approximately $4 million of nonrecurring items and site rental revenue that benefited the first quarter of 2013, and are not expected to recur in the second quarter. Approximately $3 million increase in repairs and maintenance expected in the second quarter, reflecting the increased level of activity as the weather warms, and a $12 million lower expected contribution from services in the second quarter, compared to the contribution we enjoyed in the first quarter. While we are delighted with the significant contribution from services, we are forecasting a lower contribution for the second quarter and the balance of the year. Over the last couple of years, we've been pleasantly surprised by the contribution from services, but we will continue to take a conservative view on potential levels of this service activity.","As we mentioned in the press release, we have seen a significant increase in applications since the beginning of the year, representing a more than twofold increase in the application volume by revenue, compared to the same period last year. This twofold increase in application volume by revenue includes both new and amendment activity. In the first quarter, we saw a similar level of increase in new license applications, with new license activity representing 60% of application volume by revenue. We believe this activity suggests that some of the carriers are in the early stages of infill activity to help ease capacity-related issues.","In addition, we are benefiting from amendment activity by the carriers, which is outside the scope of previously announced customer agreements, wherein we presold certain amendment activity.","I would also point out that the application volume by revenue on the T-Mobile sites we recently acquired is more than double what we expected when we originally forecasted 2013. As a result of our strong results in the first quarter and the significant increase in application volume from our customers, we have increased our 2013 outlook, which now reflects annual site rental revenue growth of 17% and AFFO per share growth of 27%. This increase in our outlook represents an expected increase in incremental growth in site rental gross margin of approximately 18% compared to our original expectations. Given the expected timing, our increase in expected new leasing activity is most impactful to our site rental run rate as we head into 2014.","Turning to Slide 7, in addition to the organic AFFO growth we expect to achieve this year, we would expect to augment this growth through opportunistic investment of cash flow and activities such as share purchases, tower acquisitions, new site construction and land purchases. Our outlook does not include the benefit from these expected investments.","For the full year 2013, we expect to generate over $1.1 billion of AFFO, and invest approximately $400 million to $500 million on capital expenditures related to the purchases of land beneath our towers, the addition of tenants our towers and the construction of new sites, leaving approximately $600 million to $700 million to invest in activity related to our core business, including purchases of our own shares and tower acquisitions. Consistent with our past practice, we are focused on investing our cash in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share. I believe this level of capital investment can add between 3% and 5% to our organic AFFO per share growth rate annually.","In summary, we had an excellent first quarter, and I'm excited about the significant increase we're seeing in leasing applications. We're off to a great start in 2013. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Thanks, Jay, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning. As Jay just mentioned, we had an excellent first quarter, exceeding our outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. And we're excited about our business as look to the balance of the year. As you know, there's a significant amount of activity in our industry currently, as all 4 major U.S. wireless carriers are engaged in major network upgrades simultaneously. And we're enjoying a significant ramping of leasing activity, as reflected in our increased 2013 guidance. In fact, over 75% of the 2013 leasing activity, contemplated by our outlook, is already in our application pipeline.","As Jay noted, we saw more than a twofold increase in application volume by revenue in the first quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, which we expect will translate into new site rental revenue during the second half of 2013. Of this significant increase in applications in the first quarter 2013, approximately 60% of the activity was from new tenants co-locating on towers they were not previously on. This is a trend we have been anticipating for some time, as some of the carriers are nearing completion of their LTE nationwide build-out. We have been expecting to see in-fill sites, or densification, as a second wave of LTE network deployment, providing us with a longer runway of expected future growth, as the carriers strive to maintain network quality and reliability through cell splitting in the face of exponential growth in mobile technology demand.","Given the urban concentration of our sites with 74% in the top 100 markets, where we expect the majority on network densification to occur, we are excited about our prospects as the next wave of leasing materializes.","In the first quarter, we also made significant progress on the integration of the T-Mobile towers, which we expect to complete in the next 3 or 4 months. While these integration activities are ongoing, the business opportunity continues to grow, and we are seeing meaningful pent-up demand from carriers to go on these sites.","As Jay mentioned, only 4 months post-closing, application volume on the T-Mobile sites is already significantly ahead of what we underwrote.","Turning to small cells. We closed on the NextG acquisition just a little over a year ago, and I am very pleased with the performance in the growth of our small cell networks, which have exceeded our initial expectations. In fact, the organic leasing growth on small cells is tracking above our business plan and we're excited to be investing for growth in this area. Our initial expectations upon closing the NextG acquisition were that we would grow adjusted EBITDA 5 to 6x within 5 years, and we are tracking towards that goal.","While small cells represents a small percentage of our overall site rental revenue, we expect and are seeing growth from small cells contribute significantly more than its relative size to the organization. This activity is consistent with the continued adoption by the carriers of small cells to create a better and more seamless experience for consumers in areas that are not adequately covered by traditional macro tower infrastructure. Based on what we can see, we anticipate multi-thousand small cell deployments annually for the foreseeable future, and we are working to capture a significant portion of this opportunity.","With every passing month, we see more examples of Crown Castle offering carriers integrated solutions in towers and small cells to meet their network requirements. As the industry leader in small cells, we remain excited about our future prospects in this extension of our business.","Before I turn the call over to questions, I'd like to make some comments on the trends we are seeing in the U.S. As evidenced by our results and our investment of $4 billion last year in the U.S. market, with the NextG and T-Mobile tower acquisitions, we remain firmly convinced that the U.S. wireless market has significant opportunities as the fastest-growing and most profitable wireless market in the world, and where we are well positioned as the preeminent wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S. According to Cisco's latest forecast, U.S. mobile data traffic grew 62% during 2012 and is expected to grow ninefold from 2012 to 2017, enabled by the faster and more robust LTE networks being deployed.","As carriers deploy LTE, it's interesting to note that U.S. 4G connections represent still only 7% of mobile connections today, yet they account for 25% of mobile traffic on the networks. The impact of 4G connections on traffic is significant, because 4G connections generate a disproportionate amount of mobile data traffic. This is the driver behind all 4 major carriers' multiyear plans to enhance the coverage and capacity of their networks. We believe this is illustrative of U.S. wireless consumer behavior and is an important trend for our business.","So in closing, to wrap up, and then we'll take some questions, we're the largest wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S. with an urban-centric portfolio where leasing activity and demand for mobile technology is the highest. We remain focused on the U.S. market, the largest and fastest-growing market in the world, where the ability of wireless carriers to make profitable investments is most apparent and barriers to entry remain high. As consistently demonstrated by our results, we believe our well-located tower portfolio and the ability to execute for customers allows us to maximize the opportunity in the U.S. market. Leveraging our experienced management team, customer relationships and services offerings across our unrivaled tower footprint, together with our leadership in small cell networks, positions us to be the provider of choice as carriers continue to enhance their networks to meet ever-increasing wireless demands.","We believe providing carriers access to our 30,000 sites, extensive small cells and fiber resources through a shared infrastructure model remains the most efficient means of delivering mobile technology to consumers. We like how we are positioned and look forward with great anticipation to the future.","It's a privilege to come on these calls and announce these results. I want to take a quick moment to thank our employees who continue to deliver these excellent results while integrating 2 major acquisitions. Delivering record levels of services revenues and meeting customers' expectations in gaining access to our sites at the heightened level of application volume we are seeing, reflects the talent and dedicated professionals we have at Crown Castle. So in closing, we had an excellent first quarter, and we look forward to the balance of the year. With that, operator, we'd be pleased to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes of the line of Philip Cusick from JP Morgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, first on the fundamentals, can you talk about what kind of visibility you have into the services business? As you said, it's been surprising you to the upside for quite some time. Is this contracted a quarter or a month out, or is it even shorter than that? And what do you expect in terms of sustainability over the next year or so?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, Phil, thanks. Obviously it's been growing and we've been doing more, including increasing the scope of work on each individual application over time. But it is hard to forecast. It's hard to forecast in terms of volume, and then as well as timing, because not all of the timing relates to things that we can control, some of it beyond our control, things like zoning, availability of equipment, lots of other things that actually impact when the timing of the jobs get done and the recognition of revenue. So given that it is lumpy, it has been going up. In relation to the application volume and the activity that we've seen, we have high expectations for it, certainly. And we'd expect that this year, full year, would be substantially greater than last year. But still, $47 million of margin in the quarter is unprecedented by a long shot for us, and so we're going to be a little gentle as we forecast that.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure. As you think about the guidance there, is that -- services revenue guidance that you give, essentially, known, and then there's extremely likely, or only potential upside from there? Or do you really put in on sort of a -- the potential that, that could miss during the quarter?","Jay A. Brown","Well, we try to basically come out with things, a level that we obviously are pretty sure we can make. I don't want to come out on a call and talk to you about why we didn't make a number. And as we've said, given the activity over the last 12 months, which has been ever increasing, it's been -- we've been beating that number obviously every quarter. But I'm cautious because there may come a time when that number flat lines or even heads back down, and so we just got to be very careful about getting too far out over of our skis on that one. And again, the last thing I would add is, remember, carriers are not compelled to use us. And so while we're very pleased with the activity and we work very hard to secure that business, they don't have to use us. So while it is related to the activity in the market, we certainly can't absolutely control it.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. If I may, on just a completely different subject, I think there was an article in, I think it was Barron's this weekend, talking about how a lot companies are moving toward REIT status, and I worry about this. What are your advisors telling you about the situation in DC towards REITs, and is there possibility you might move this ahead a little bit, in order to get yourself in '14, rather than wait until '15?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, sure, Phil. We've already started some of the preliminary work on REIT conversion in terms of considering who our advisors will be and legal counsel and how that would look. We've spent a considerable amount of time internally looking at what we would need to do in order to make that, make the conversion. I would tell you just broadly, and there've been a number of articles written about some of the businesses that are trying to make themselves look at close to real estate as they can, in order to pursue a single taxation-type model. And when you look at the tower business, this is a real estate business and, certainly, when they set up the pass-through entity status and looked at real estate as one of the prime examples that have taken advantage of that, that's what we are. We're a real estate business, and it's not a stretch to figure out how our business relates to that. Broadly, on tax reform, I mean, there may be tax reform over time, and if there is tax reform, then obviously, we'll have to look at what we think is the best approach for the company. But I think some of the concerns about what the IRS may or may not do in terms of including various businesses in -- as REITs, it's hard to imagine how you could define real estate and not include -- and not include towers. So I think we feel pretty comfortable about it. And we've started to work, and you're right to say, we'll burn through our NOL in about 2015, beginning of 2016, and so I think our conversion is in next -- inside of the next 24 to 36 months, and we've already started the early work to get that done.","Operator","Our next question comes of the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So, I've got -- I was interested in the services business and kind of the cost structure, and as revenues go higher or lower, is that primarily a fixed cost basis or the variable costs, were you using contractors? Just wanted to get a little bit more of a flavor for that. And then, it sounds like from their comments, there was a point during 1Q where there was a trigger where you -- that the prepaid amount of activity was sort of exceeded, and from this point forward, a lot of the activity level then gets reflected in incremental site leasing revenues and, am I thinking about that correctly? And are there other MLAs where we might sort of see that trigger later on this year?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, John, I'll take the first one. On the services business, we do have some variable cost structure built into there, and we have added people over the last year, really almost at an unprecedented rate for Crown Castle, given that it's -- we run with lots of assets and few people. We've added a number of folks to handle this work load. We do have some variable cost in there, a number of them are contractors. I think the essence of your question is, if it were to flex down, can some of the cost structure come out? And the answer is absolutely. And so we always keep an eye on what do we think is sort of baseline core services activity, and then what is -- what are we seeing based on all this activity, appreciating that we've added 1\/3 to the portfolio, too, so you're going to have a higher increasing rate of activity, just because the portfolio's bigger. But there is a significant amount of variable cost in that business that could flex appropriately.","Jay A. Brown","John, your second question around prepaid activity. As you probably saw from the release, we add an additional footnote to the straight-line revenue disclosure that we've given over the last year plus, when we went through this AFFO metric that the industry has gone to, to show you the one component of that number that has some volatility in it, which is related to prepaid activity. So we've called that, we've called that out. And in periods where there's a significant amount of construction and activity going on, we're going to see more prepaid. I think we've talked about in past quarters, directionally, that straight-line revenue number, in the absence of any construction activity, is headed to about breakeven in the 2016 timeframe. And so, if -- just as a simple example, if you were to say we didn't have any prepaid activity in 2016, we would expect the current drag, that is straight-line revenue, of about $130 million to go to 0. So just growth in absolute cash received from our tenant licenses is going to grow significantly over the next couple of years. So we were trying to spike that out a little bit to show you that the one component of that, that does have some volatility. And I guess I'll make a similar comment to what I made around services that we'll continue to take a pretty conservative view there. And it's a -- a lot of it comes down from timing. I think directionally, we feel great about the year, which you can certainly take from our comments about where application volume is. And then with regard to services and construction activities, we'll have to see how it develops over the course of the year. It's harder for us to predict exactly where those items are going to fall.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then finally, on the applications you talked about, and the kind of the increased levels for new colo applications, does that, then, really start to hit the financials, not until 2014, or could that benefit this year's site leasing performance?","Jay A. Brown","It does reflect somewhat in calendar year 2013. As I mentioned in my comments, we took up our fourth quarter site rental gross margin in terms of incremental growth year-over-year by about 18%. So that's a direct result of that leasing activity and the applications that we're seeing. It is, as you point out though, most impactful to the 2014 run rate. Generally speaking, we have about 4 to 5 months from the date we receive an application until it becomes revenue. So that application activity that we saw in the first quarter really becomes revenue into the third quarter, and gets the -- you get the impact there for the balance of this year, but most impactful as we think about run rates into 2014. And I think we are really encouraged about, broadly, what we see the carriers working on and where that application activity is going as we transition from, what has been the last couple of years, a predominantly an amendment mix, to now seeing a significant number of brand new lease applications where carriers are going -- desiring to go on towers they're not currently co-located on. And that's having a big impact as we think about in the fourth quarter, and where we head into 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes of the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. I want follow-up on Phil's REIT question and as we get ready to go to NAREIT pretty soon. Jay, you mentioned the conversion in 24 to 36 months. Given that tax status is for a calendar year, would you actually maybe consider converting to a REIT in the middle of the year? And how would that kind of logistically work, given the accumulated EMP dividend payment, et cetera?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, I think the first step after we lay out the plan is to pursue the private lateral ruling from the IRS. There have been a number of tower companies and land lease companies that have gone down this path, both public and private companies. So there's a good track record there in terms of how the IRS responds to this, so we feel pretty good about that. But that would be the next step. And then once we've received that private letter ruling, then it just becomes an election for us to convert to a REIT. And those 2 things don't necessarily have to go together, so we could pursue and obtain a private letter ruling and then wait before -- wait to make the REIT conversion decision at a later date. And I think I've broadly discussed here, how we think about capital allocation in that discussion. And given the amount of growth that we're seeing in the business and where we see cash flow per share growing over the next couple of years, we thought it appropriate to maintain the flexibility to use our cash flow, to be able to go out and either buy acquisitions or buy back our own shares. We think we've done that really successfully over a long period of time. And so by waiting on the dividend, until it's the most tax advantageous approach in the business, we think we can deliver outsized returns to the shareholders. But it's something that we're certainly considering, and I wouldn't dismiss the possibility that we don't go a little bit early. And we're just in the early stages of working on it, and would make the decision when appropriate.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And would it be a decision that would be tied to a January 1 kind of date, like American Tower did for the whole tax year? Or is it something you could do within a tax year and go back? Just trying to think of the, kind of calendar timing.","Jay A. Brown","I think the practical answer is we would probably do it on January 1. There are ways you wouldn't necessarily have to do that, but, in all likelihood, we would think about it as a calendar year decision.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That makes great sense. And one follow up on the T-Mobile side. You said it was doing twice your forecast, the T-Mobile towers that you've brought in. Is that just that you guys started the underwriting, maybe thinking that they would start slowly? And then also, on the 60% of the applications have new colos as kind of a revenue base, are the T-Mobile ones seeing that too, I would expect?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. Rick, this is Ben. So on the -- look, it's only been 4 months, so we're happy to tell you that we're ahead of plan, but it's 4 months in, and we obviously had a long-term leasing forecast. But we're ahead of plan significantly already with the T-Mobile assets. And yes, I would suggest to you that they're tracking colos as well as amendment activity.","Operator","Our next question comes of the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of the activity by carrier? And then, as a second question, you talked about the timeframe from getting an application to seeing that application turn into revenue, and I imagine, that 4 to 5 months for new sites is longer than what you might -- in an amendment process. If that is the case, do you feel like you have more visibility into the forward business today than maybe what you were expecting a quarter or 2 quarters ago?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Jonathan, let me start with the first part, on -- by carrier. We generally resist calling out individual carriers and their deployment plans and what's going on. Obviously we have a pretty good window into that from our seat. But you can certainly take from their comments, the carriers' public disclosure, where they are in terms of their initial LTE deployment. And they're in varying stages of completion, if you will, in the first level of amendment activity through their existing networks. And as we've anticipated for some time, we will see infill, or densification, resulting from either increased small cells in areas where there's -- they're capacity-challenged, where consumers essentially are consuming the LTE capacity that's now available on the macro site. Or, now a redeployment of capital back into adding additional sites that may have been on the list for a long time, but would be prioritized, based upon the need to go ahead and get the original first cut sort of LTE deployment overlay done, and now they've come back and addressed the obvious places that, for some time, they've needed some help, which is handled first and foremost by macro sites and then, obviously, infill in more urban areas by small cells. So we're seeing that -- I would say almost in direct relation to where the carrier is in their LTE deployment. So that's about as far as I'll go with you, but you can sort of walk through, okay, where is everybody in their LTE deployment, and you can assume that's sort of how we're seeing this play out. The 4- to 5-month lag on application to revenue is pretty consistent; that hasn't really changed over time. I mean -- and there's some variables in there that we control, and there's some variables in there that are out of our control, things like, again, availability of equipment, zoning, availability of crews. I mean, there's just a lot of things that have to happen there. Consents from landlords. Just a long list of things that typically on average takes in that 4- to 5-month recognition period. So I'd say that's pretty consistent.","Jay A. Brown","Jonathan, one thing I would say, which we talked about, I think, at some length last quarter, is that we're in an unprecedented time of public -- private carriers, public disclosure around their multiyear plans for CapEx spending. And historically, we've -- given some public comments, generally about the next 9 to 12 months, and what they're going to do in any given year, and you have most of the carriers who've come out with at least 2- to 3-year CapEx plans and what those plans are going to entail, in terms of both small cell deployments, in macro sites and amendment activity. And so I think we have, we probably have about the same amount of visibility on a quarter-by-quarter basis as we've ever had. But the one thing that has changed is the longer-term view that the carriers have taken about their network, and we're just working through that as we go through the near term.","Operator","Our next question comes of the line of Mike McCormick with Nomura Securities.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Ben, can you just comment on the environment out there. You guys talked a couple of times, I guess, about acquisition opportunities. I think AT&T has been pretty vocal about looking into that. Is there any change in the carrier behavior on that side? And then, secondly, do you guys evaluate looking at the DISH-Sprint combination. What kind of opportunities would that provide for you guys?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure. On the acquisition front, as Jay mentioned, there's always things in the pipeline. And there's a couple of, I'd call them medium-sized things that were looking at. I think Jay used to -- about 3% of assets that's about right. We would have effectively fund that out of cash flow. And so that's why we're looking at maybe holding off a little bit until we know the end of -- the outcome on those. But in general, I'd say the industry, if I could editorialize for a minute, has gotten pretty comfortable with third-party ownership of independent towers. And we own, as an industry, a very significant component of the cell sites in the U.S. that are made available on a shared basis. And that model is working very well and is a very cost-effective and efficient way for carriers to occupy their infrastructure. So look, I think that's well established and certainly will continue. With respect to the DISH and Sprint discussions or Softbank or anyone else that you might hear about on radio or TV, seemingly every day, that wants access to wireless networks and ultimately, consumers. It's very heartening for us that when we hear about those discussions and it just describes to us or confirms that the fundamental value that's resident in these wireless networks way above and beyond what's evident today. And so whether you talk about DISH for their obvious business purpose around an augmentation to their satellite TV strategy, whether you talk about Softbank or any other technology company that constantly is looking for access to wireless consumers through devices, the whole mobile technology wave to us is very exciting and suggests a long-term run here on the need, the necessity to access the infrastructure that we own. And again, I keep coming back to this shared model because we think it's a very attractive way to provide infrastructure on a common or a shared basis to these carriers, a very efficient way. And it's not just resident in wireless. I mean, there's a number of other example where that's the case. So we are very excited about the long-term prospects and there's things out there on the horizon that we don't talk about or certainly don't put in our forecast. I would include FirstNet in that discussion. So lots more to come in our expectation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, Jay, obviously, a very big hike to the AFFO number here. We've got a few of the piece parts but not everything. Can you walk us through maybe a bridge to the AFFO increase? Maybe talk through site rental gross margins, network services gross margins and then maybe changes in customer prepayments, how that all fits together and contributes? And then second question, I guess, maybe just going back to the acquisition landscape. When you talk about deals out there that sort of in total are 3% of assets, with your leverage backed down to 6.1 turns, are you saying these are the assets that are out there and, hence, that's what you're engaged in, or are you saying you still can't engage in bigger deals, if there are out there? Because it seems like with the leverage, where it is, you probably could engage in larger deals.","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On the increase in outlook, we've got about $9 million in the calendar year related to interest savings, which I alluded to in my comments when we repriced our Term Loan B. There's another about $29 million that's related to increases in adjusted EBITDA from where we were previously for the full year. Then we have the benefit that we talked about from fiber in the first quarter, as well as there will likely be some for the balance of the year. And that, basically, bridges the balance of the year in terms of the total increase in AFFO. And, Jason, I think, maybe I would point to just that level of activity in my comments before about construction and where applications go, ultimately, that will be somewhat of a driver as we get into the balance of the year. If it's at an elevated level, we may do a little bit better from those kind of activity, but very difficult for us to predict that at this point. So most of it is really just adjusted EBITDA growth and that's coming from the outperformance in the current quarter, as well as our raise in terms of expectations for site rental revenue, that's the driver there for the growth in adjusted EBITDA, the interest savings and then, really, what we already achieved in the first quarter makes up the bulk of it. On your second question around leverage at 6.1x, really, my comment, for what I was alluding to, was, if you look at capital spending or share -- and share purchases and acquisitions, we didn't send all the cash flow that we earned during the first quarter, which has, I guess, normally been our practice to invest most of it during the quarter. That 3% represents specific assets -- less than 3% of our total assets. Those represents specific acquisitions that we're in the process of looking at currently. No promises that will be successful on those, but it's been said we think we can fund those out of cash flow. And so we were, in essence, holding on to cash and not making investments, waiting for the outcome on those. I think, broadly, to the extent that something larger than what is relatively small acquisitions would have come about, then that would be a different discussion and we'd have to look at those assets. This is -- my comments are related to specifically to some specific assets that we were looking at and why we didn't invest all the cash flow that we earned in the quarter.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. If I could follow-up on one other thing that's come up during the call, you talked about maybe an ability to pull forward going after a private letter ruling. Is there -- I guess, I'm just not familiar with what sort of expiration or renewal would be required. How far in advance of actually converting could you actually achieve that and then wait to convert and have that sort of designation still hold?","Jay A. Brown","It would be good for a couple of years. We wouldn't -- that private letter ruling doesn't really doesn't really expire.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I guess, there's been a lot of hand wringing over the last quarter, and I think we addressed a couple of the reasons. One was concerns that maybe towers were going x growth, and I think you guys addressed that with some of the applications demand you're talking about. Another reason was some of the M&A anxiety about 4 to 3 combinations, and I think that is working itself out. I would say, maybe, the one last thing that has come up again and again has been subsequent to AT&T's announcement that it was going to do 2 things to expand its network. One, was to expand their macro cell sites, accelerating it by about 50%, but also introducing 40,000 new small cells. There's been anxiety about how small cells might be a substitute for the macro cell sites or how, as we densify the markets, which is going to be in more of the urban areas where towers aren't, is the opportunity going to skew away from where the towers are? Probably nobody knows more about that than you guys, other than AT&T. Could you kind of map us or walk us through, maybe, Ben, kind of how the architecture works and whether it's complementary and whether we should be worried about the ultimate substitution nature of that business?","Jay A. Brown","David, that's a great question. And obviously, we believe and our experiencing the fact that it's complementary, and it's really all of the above. We know from our drive testing precisely which sites, existing macro sites, could solve existing needs in the marketplace. And as I've said a few minutes ago, one of the things that's been -- we've seen, clearly, and it makes perfect sense a little bit in hindsight, is the carriers' capital and focus has been on amending existing sites, for obvious reasons, multi thousands of them. And as we've disclosed, I think last year we had 23,000 individual applications inside the company. I mean, that's just a mind-boggling number. Those are amendments, primarily, on the first pass of LTE. That doesn't -- we're not suggesting that they don't need any other macro sites, it's just that's the first thing that happened. Now, as you're seeing, the next thing that's happening is they're going back and starting to address the obvious sites that would have satisfied additional coverage or capacity requirements, with LTE being part of that installation as sort of the second way. And we believe that will continue. And we see that happening in macro sites. We think -- are certainly the most efficient way to cover the capacity challenges and coverage challenges that remain out there today, and that will continue. But that's not sufficient. There's a lot of places, as you point out in your question, where small cells can augment in a very small geographic area, the capacity that may not be available from the macro site or even the rooftop site. And so while -- if you're standing there in that location, you might actually have 1 or 2 bars of coverage on your phone from the macro site, it's not enough to do the mobile technology or the mobile broadband services that the carriers want to provide and that were willing to pay for, apparently, because that's what's happening. And so that's why you see the carriers talking about multi-thousand small cells being added as augmentation to add capacity and effectively reuse the spectrum in a micro cell on those, if you will, and multiply the capacity that's available to the consumer in those in urban areas. But it's really both. And I think what's driving this -- what we paid close attention to is the ability for the carriers to continue to make capital investments to add data capacity and densification, and drive incremental EBITDA and margin through their wireless businesses. And from what we can tell, that's very evident and that's there today. And so that's why we -- one of the primary reasons we were so excited about what we see in the U.S. We, as consumers, are prepared to and expect to pay for data services, and we are doing that. And there's a lot more devices coming and applications coming. And as I mentioned earlier, technology companies that want access to wireless consumers, that I suspect we're all going to be paying for more services in the future and getting more out of it. But that's basically how it's working. It's both.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Perfect. And then just -- if I could, one last one. With respect to the different potential combinations out there, sorry to put you on the spot, but if you could come up with the dream scenario for towers, for Crown Castle in particular, among the publicly announced transactions that are going out there today. What would you be rooting for, what would you be rooting against?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I don't think I'm going to touch that one. We like where we are. We like where we are and what we have. And the carriers, obviously, have their own business plans and they're working hard to do it. What we're focused on is making sure that we're the most efficient and cost-effective means for them to deploy their network to consumers, and that's what we are.","Operator","Our next question comes on the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wonder if you could talk about a couple of other revenue sources, microwave dishes, anything on generators in the post-Sandy world, you've seen increased demand there. And coming back to this 60% coming from new colos, do you think we've now flipped permanently that we've gone from an amendment dominated to a new colo dominated, or is that going to fluctuate around? And I think that was something that a lot of people thought would be more of a 2014 effect, so thoughts on that?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure. Simon, we are seeing some microwaves on sites, and that's contributing to the revenue growth we're seeing. And then in terms of predicting the mix of colos, I think, to a degree, is a function of sort of where we are in the deployment plans or progress with the various carriers on their LTE amendment. As we've noted, and we got out in front of some this pretty early with carriers on our sites, and so we've sort of come through the crest, if you will, on LTE amendment activity. And so I think the natural then is to come back to the colos. How we would predict that it continues, I mean, we can again, we can see where there are obvious needs. It's challenging to predict exactly how they prioritize their capital. Obviously, 4 months into the year now, we're very pleased with what we've seen. I would point out, though, that in the guidance, we were a little conservative. We didn't necessarily forecast that this level of activity continue the entire year. So we obviously had great results in the first quarter and we expect that, that will pick up, that will generate revenue, as Jay mentioned, in the third and fourth quarter, but we're still -- we're going to take this quarter at a time and see how it goes.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Anything on generators?","W. Benjamin Moreland","A little bit. That's is a difficult one. There is still a capital allocation discussion there that happens within each carrier. We do have, obviously, generator space. We've done share generator models in the past for carriers. It really comes down to a capital prioritization within the carrier. But we have, certainly, availability of ground space and the willingness to own and share generators, when that becomes the preferred approach. I mean, there's a lot of things going on between battery backup power, elevated platforms, mobile generators. And so we'll -- I think there's, obviously, been appropriate attention on the issue and we stand ready to help where we can.","Operator","Our next question comes of the line of Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I think in your guidance that you had provided in the beginning of the year, you had not included any Clearwire revenues in it. Given the new guidance, do we -- have you included Clearwire in it now? And also wanted to just clarify the lag periods that you've mentioned, the application to recognition of revenues, so 4 to 5 months. When Sprint talks that they're going to deploy LTE on 800 in the fourth quarter, would they be starting that process today or could that potentially provide upside throughout the year?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure. In your first question, with regards to Clearwire, we did not put them in the original outlook in terms of expectations for additional leasing from them, and we've not included any in this current outlook, so no change there. On the timing, generally speaking, if a carrier is indicating that a site is going to be on air on a specific date or inside a specific quarter, the application would need to come to us 4 to 5 months ahead of that date in order to get them on air on their targeted date.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just one more. How should we think about the new construction CapEx this year? And how many new towers do you expect to build? I think the new tower count this quarter was a bit lower than we expected. Do you expect that to ramp up throughout the year?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Most of the new construction CapEx that we're spending is related to small cell network deployment, and so I don't think you'll see us build a whole lot of towers this calendar year. Most of that will be related to spending on the small cell side, which we continue to find opportunities for. If I had to guess where we'll end up at the end of the year, it would probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about $150 million on new sites. As we've talked about, though, it's a bit of a soft outlook or soft guidance, because at the returns we're able to achieve in these building of new sites, whether that's small cells or towers, we'll do all that we can find. And so that $150 million is really our best estimate of where the opportunities are currently. And if more opportunities show up, we'd happily invest at a higher level than that.","Operator","Our next question comes of the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","What is the current AFFO contribution from DAS, if it is positive? And when will this begin to have a significant impact in AFFO growth as you complete some of the initial CapEx?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure. It is contributing, it is positive to AFFO. We don't segment reports our small cell business, it's right inside of our tower business. So we try to get some color on some of the trend lines given the amount of capital investment we made last year and ongoing, but I'm not going to get into specifically how much it's contributing. On a growth basis, it's making a meaningful difference. As Ben talked about, disproportionate to its size, we're seeing a significant amount of activity and leasing associated with that business. So it's positively impacting AFFO and the flow through down through EBITDA.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","Have you seen any increases in tenancy on DAS? What is your average tenants per DAS site and what was that a year ago?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Well, when you look at the average tenancy, it's a mixed bag. Because what's happening, given the number of new networks we're building, where we'll have a single tenant or maybe 2 tenants on day 1, it will bring down the overall average tenants per DAS network. As we look at the older systems that are on there, the vintage is exactly what we would expect. And as we compare that vintage to the legacy of towers, we're adding the second and third and fourth tenant at a rate faster than what we've historically been able to do with towers. And so if you were to track it on a system-by-system basis, you'd see a rate of growth on additional tenancy that looks better than what we've seen over the last 15 years in towers.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","And that's about 0.125 per year or 1\/10 over 8 years on the macro site?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. Yes, that would be about right on the macro site, and it's tracking higher on that on DAS.","Operator","Our next question comes of the line of Michael Rollins, Citi Investment Research.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Could you just clarify what the internal same tower growth rate was for the quarter? And do you have handy the prepaid rent number for the fourth quarter of 2012? I noticed you gave 1Q '13, 1Q '11 -- sorry, 1Q '12. Do you have that 4Q just to compare sequentially, that would be helpful?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. On the same tower sales, basically, that number is in the ballpark of about $150 million of cash and a little over half of that would be the cash escalators, and then organic growth would be the rest of that, Mike. And that would be separating out the significant ones that would be affecting that would be related to the T-Mobile acquisition that we did. If we go back and look at where the net prepaid -- the net straight-line impact was in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter, it's pretty similar. It moves about $3 million from the fourth quarter of 2012 in our favor in terms of higher cash, $2 million to $3 million from Q4 into Q1.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And so as you look at this, then, does that imply that straight-line would have actually been higher in 1Q, so some of the sequential revenue growth may have been held by straight-line? I'm just trying to get a sense of actual growth rates of the internal tower performance and just trying to understand the different impacts that fiber prepaid rents are now having on the financials?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Well, if you separated the activity that drive prepaid, as I was mentioning, the construction activity and we spoke specifically about the fiber activity. If you were to strip that out, Mike, completely, that number, the total number today, is the drag on cash of about $135 million. And that includes the benefit we're getting currently because of the construction activity. If you were to take that number and forecast it out to 2016 and say that there was no benefit to the company from construction activity, so this would be a theoretical environment where there's no leasing activity and no construction activity going on, that drag goes from a drag to basically breakeven in 2016. And the trend line between today and then is a relatively straight line. And so as the construction activity happens, depending on the level of activity there, it's going to make that number get closer to breakeven in some period of time shorter than what it otherwise would if there no amount of construction activity. So I think underlying this, and maybe this is helpful just to back up a step, from a cash standpoint, looking at the $2.2 billion of cash revenue that we have, the average escalator there is just a hair under 4%. And so there's about $80 million a year of cash growth just coming from existing base of business. And that's going to happen on a relatively straight-line basis from now through the average term of the leases remaining, which is about 9 years, 8 to 9 years remaining. And so we'll see that cash growth flow through and that will drive down that straight-line revenue number.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","A question for you with regard to what you're seeing in trends for the 4G LTE builds in 2013 versus 2014. We had heard that there might be a little bit of a push out from '13 into '14, not a decrease, but a push out that seems to be maybe going against what I'm hearing from you guys. But I'd like to hear your color on that.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. No, I wouldn't agree with that. We're not seeing a push out. We're seeing a lot of work happen, again, that we are -- we've been on this amendment work for the last 2 years in a very big way. And so I would venture to guess, speculate with you that in 2013, we'll do less LTE amendments than we did last year, only because we're sort of getting through the halfway point of our overall portfolio and more, as we've talked about several times, significantly more co-location than we did last year. So as it relates to Crown's portfolio, obviously the only one we could speak to, I'd say we're probably pass the halfway point in aggregate between all 4 carriers combined. I'd say we're probably, this is unscientific, but we're probably right about halfway. And it's certainly not slowing down.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one follow-up on the small cells. If there's a small cell deployment that's not on one of your towers or not on one of your sites, is there any way that at carrier can go in and negotiate a building right themselves or would they still be doing it through you?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Well, let's sort of go back through that. Obviously, if the tower is our tower, we'll negotiate with ourselves. If it's a small cell, we'll have fiber in an area. So if it's a -- let's just take an outdoor situation where we have fiber, there's nothing technically precluding them from laying their own fiber, but that would be very cost inefficient relative to ourselves. We already have a shared model there and so the neutral host model, just as in the towers, is alive and well and working in our favor and making it more efficient for the carrier to operate on a small cell they would add to an existing network. And with respect to a building, the general rule is, on a building, we have an exclusive right. If we're in a public venue or stadium or basketball arena or something like that, then it's an exclusive right in partnership with the building owner or the municipality, where we're on a, typically, a revenue share basis and they have to work through Crown.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And one last thing, as far as the small cells. We've been hearing a lot about, I guess, multiband small cells. How important do you think it is and how far along are the equipment providers with regard to that? And what type of impact do you think that could have positively or negatively?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I think, certainly, positive. I mean, the  opportunity to add additional capacity in the small cell is essentially what we're doing. There's a physical constraint sometimes on each individual pole, so you have to go next pole over if you're on an outside DAS system, just on based on zoning and just the physical limitation. But combining multiband is already happening. And in some cases, that's actually -- when we think of the vernacular of tenant, we try to get keep it simple. The tenants oftentimes in small cells is additional bands, additional slots in the box. And that's additional revenue.","Operator","Our next question comes of the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. I actually just want to talk about interest rates. I think one of the things that we've been hearing from investors, certainly, through the course of this year is the concern that with rising interest rates, it could be negative for the tower providers, particularly as it relates to M&A. And I was wondering if you could just share with us what you've seen as it relates to interest rates with the potential debt insurance that you look at to finance some of your transactions as what's happened with interest rates pushed you to do one type of instrument versus another one, perhaps CMBS? And if you can just give us a little bit of color there to help us get a little bit more comfortable on the ability to contain and pay the multiples that you are paying, and still have these transactions be accretive?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. I think the first point I would make is the comment that I made during the prepared remarks. If you look at the current balance sheet, we've got about 7 years -- almost 7 years remaining on the average term, and the average coupon is about 4.5%. That mix of our current debt is about 70% fixed rate and about 30% floating rate. So over the next 6.5 to 7 years, the exposure that we have to near-term rates is about 30% of our overall mix. We have seen over a long period time, obviously, in the business, those interest rates fluctuate. And the cost of debt fluctuates. And when it does, the cost of -- and our willingness to buy assets can fluctuate as well. Today in the market, we could be an issuer of long-term debt, senior debt at the parent company, somewhere in the neighborhood of 5% to 5.5%, and so the debt is still attractive. And as you pointed out, we've looked at other opportunities where we've gone down at the asset level and limited the amount of leverage that we put down there to achieve an investment-grade credit rating. And have found very attractive fixed rates on debt that we can do for long periods of time. And so it's more than a single-pronged question, it relates both to what's the cost of debt, and then based on that, we can adjust our willingness to buy assets at. And so over time, we think we've got a pretty good structure in terms of flexibility around where we can finance the assets, whether at the asset level or up at the parent level. And to the extent that we pursue acquisitions again, it's relative to our other alternative, which is buying back our own stock. And that's proven to be a very attractive investment over a long period of time.","W. Benjamin Moreland","I think with that we'll wrap it up. And again, I appreciate everybody's attention this morning and joining us on the call. We are very pleased with how the year has started off. And we look forward to visiting with you on the next quarter call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Fiona McKone. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Fiona McKone","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us as we review our third quarter 2013 results and discuss our agreement to acquire the exclusive rights to approximately 9,700 towers from AT&T that we announced yesterday.","With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. Ben is going to begin with a discussion of the AT&T transaction, and Jay will follow with a review of our third quarter 2013 results and our outlook for 2013 and 2014. To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website, crowncastle.com, which we will discuss throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements and information based on management's current expectations. Although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurances that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

In addition, today's call may include discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, funds from operations, funds from operations per share, adjusted funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations per share. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures are available under the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Thanks, Fiona, and thank you to all of you for joining us on this rather short notice call this morning as we discuss this very exciting news that we announced yesterday, as well as review our earnings release for the third quarter.","First, let me start by saying this transaction we've announced is all about growth, pure and simple, and our belief in growth and accretion and AFFO per share relative to other potential investments we could have made over time. In acquiring the rights to these 9,700 towers from AT&T, we're continuing to execute our principal strategic objective: positioning Crown Castle as the leader in the U.S. market, the largest wireless market in the world, and one that we believe is the most continuable -- continuing profitable investment in wireless networks is most assured.","These towers are well positioned to accommodate the demand we're seeing as network intensification, following the initial phase of LTE deployment, is driving macro site co-location in the market. This opportunity, with this portfolio with AT&T as the counter-party, is generational in nature. Post-closing, AT&T will be our largest customer at 26% of revenues, and the Big 4 U.S. wireless carriers will make up 84% of our consolidated site rental revenue, a clear differentiator among our peers. I want to take a moment here to acknowledge and thank our friends at AT&T for the confidence they have placed in Crown Castle over the years and, now, as we extend our relationship to cover these new sites.","Turning to Slide 6. Importantly, as noted in our press release, from a financial perspective, we expect this transaction to be slightly accretive to AFFO per share in 2014 and expect that it is meaningfully accretive to our expected growth over time. As is our practice, we were disciplined and focused in our financial assessment of this transaction and believe it will be more accretive to our long-term growth rates in enhancing the shareholder value relative to other potential investments, such as buying back our own stock. In fact, we expect the transaction to be approximately 5% accretive to our long-term expected AFFO per share.","While this transaction increases our tower portfolio by 33% in the U.S., the consideration represents only 15% of our enterprise value, illustrating the significant growth opportunity we have secured on these relatively young assets, which currently have, on average, only 1.7 tenants per tower. Further, as is customary in tower transactions with carriers, the rent we receive from AT&T includes access to additional space on the towers for its future use, subject to certain restrictions. Additionally, we have the right to lease space to additional tenants, which is the essential element of the value creation in this transaction. Further, we believe the AT&T towers have sufficient capacity to accommodate at least 1 additional tenant per tower without significant further investment. We have a long track record of integrating assets and creating value from our customer relationships, solutions and services.","Turning to Slide 7. Let me run through some of the details of the transaction and some of the reasons why we believe this is a terrific transaction for Crown Castle. Under our agreement with AT&T, we will have the right and responsibilities to operate the asset like any others that we own. We will take $4.85 billion to AT&T for the exclusive rights to lease and operate these towers for a weighted average life of approximately 28 years, and we will have the right to purchase such towers thereafter. As part of the transaction, AT&T is contracted to maintain its communications facilities on the towers for a minimum of 10 years across all of the sites. We expect to fund the transaction with cash on hand and equity and debt financing, including borrowing under our existing revolving credit facility. And we expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Turning to Slide 8. At almost 40,000 towers pro forma with 71% or 28,000 sites in the top 100 markets, this transaction furthers our strategic objective of being the leader in shared wireless infrastructure in the U.S., which we believe is the largest and fastest growing and most profitable wireless market in the world. As you can see from the graph, the U.S. is the global leader in average revenue per user, and yet, there is still a considerable amount of expected growth in mobile data traffic still to come. This transaction comes at an opportune time for co-locations as all 4 major wireless carriers are actively upgrading their networks for LTE 4G, and these sites are well positioned to accommodate the cell splitting that we're already seeing as carriers focus on improving network quality.","At recent industry conference keynote addresses, wireless carriers continue to voice their commitment to network upgrade as the price of admission to compete in the U.S. market. With networks already supply-constrained in the face of broadband data growth estimates of 6 to 8x over the next 4 years, it's very clear to us that the U.S. market is one where we will see significant growth in the years to come. The top U.S. markets are where wireless traffic is heaviest and where wireless carriers traditionally focus their efforts to deploy new technologies and upgrades to existing technologies, such as the current LTE deployment and network densification.","Turning to Slide 9. We believe that the U.S. market represents the most compelling risk-adjusted returns for capital investment in wireless infrastructure. These AT&T towers represent a unique opportunity to acquire a large, urban-centric portfolio and further our strategy. On a pro forma basis, we will have 71% of our towers listed in the top 100 markets and 96% of our total sites located in the U.S. One of the areas that also bolsters our belief in the U.S. market is the ability of infrastructure owners to control the ground beneath their assets for very long periods of time. Our team has been focused on this for years, and I believe we have the most secured ground profile in the industry as we control land under our sites for more than 20 years, generating 72% of our site rental gross margin.","Turning to Slide 10, I also believe the quality of our tenant base is the best in the industry with 84% of our pro forma consolidated site rental revenues coming from the Big 4 wireless carriers. As a result of the transaction, we will have more than $21 billion of future contracted revenue from our existing customer leases, which represents approximately 8 years of run rate site rental revenue.","Shown on Slide 11, our demonstrated track record of growing site rental revenue and allocating capital productively has enabled us to grow AFFO per share by a 20% compound annual growth rate dating back to 2007. I would point out that we've been able to achieve our annual growth -- AFFO without increasing our risk profile by focusing our capital allocation on the U.S. market.","As shown on Page 12, we have gotten over the short -- we've proven over the short and long term that we're able to transact, integrate, lease and operate carrier assets in ways that create significant value. Our transaction with AT&T is the sixth wireless carrier portfolio transaction that we have done in the U.S. On the left-hand side of the page, we've shown the growth in yield before these transactions that date back over a decade. These assets continue to increase their cash flow and resulting yields. I will also note that our T-Mobile transaction that we completed just under a year ago is fully integrated and tracking ahead of our original acquisition model.","We believe, like the value we have created from the 5 other carrier tower transactions we've done, we will continue to drive shareholder value through our operation of these towers. Fundamentally, this is a real estate business, and our experience has been that carrier-built towers are in the best locations time and time again. In addition to the carrier transactions, we've seen tremendous growth in our NextG acquisition in the small cell business that we completed in April of 2012, where we have more than doubled the adjusted EBITDA since closing the transaction. Leveraging our experienced management team, customer relationships and services offerings across this unrivaled tower footprint, together with our leadership in small cell networks, positions us to be the provider of choice as carriers continue to enhance their networks to meet ever-increasing wireless demand.","So let me conclude on this topic of the transaction before I call -- turn the call over to Jay by offering the following observation. Over the last 18 months, including this transaction, we've invested approximately $9 billion in the U.S. market, adding over 17,000 towers and 10,000 small cell nodes that we believe materially enhances our growth opportunity as these assets are essential to meeting carriers' network demands with the benefit of the shared infrastructure model that we deliver for carriers.","We are bullish on the U.S. market, to say the least, and bring the execution capability to realize on our strategy. We believe the premier location of the assets, low existing tenant fees, high operating leverage and minimal incremental costs, together with the efficient capital structure we have in place, strengthens our position as a leader in facilitating wireless network deployment in the U.S. while enhancing our long-term growth rates and AFFO per share expectations.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jay to walk through our results and outlook, and thank you again for joining this call this morning.","Jay A. Brown","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we had an excellent third quarter, delivering 38% growth in AFFO per share compared to the same quarter last year. The strong leasing activity continued during the third quarter. Further, as you would expect, this high level of leasing activity from all 4 major U.S. carriers resulted in continued strong performance in our services business, which outperformed our expectation for the third quarter.","On Slide 14 and 15, we highlight some of the results for our third quarter. During the third quarter, we generated site rental revenue of $621 million, up 15% from the third quarter of 2012. We have seen a significant shift towards higher revenue growth because of the composition of our leasing activity during 2013 compared to 2012.","As we've previously disclosed, a portion of the leasing activity we have seen in recent years is the result of agreements we have made with certain carriers, whereby they commit to pay us for the right to add equipment to their existing arrays on our towers and then utilize that predefined right over time. As a result, we recognized revenue beginning at the firm commitment dates of these agreements. We have often described these arrangements as presold leasing agreements. Notably, during the third quarter of 2013, only 20% of our leasing activity was covered by these presold leasing agreements.","Conversely, presold leasing agreements accounted for almost 70% of the leasing activity in the same quarter last year. This change in the composition of our leasing activity reflects the carriers' focus on deploying their equipment on additional sites, commonly referred to as site densification, an amendment activity to their existing arrays that exceeds what was contemplated in the presold leasing arrangement. I would also note that we are seeing tremendous leasing activity in our small cell networks as carriers look for ways to improve their networks in areas not served by traditional macro sites.","With regard to our other metrics for the quarter, site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenues less the cost of operations, was $439 million, up 9% from the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2013 was $441 million, up 10% from the third quarter of 2012. As shown, AFFO for the third quarter of 2013 was $318 million, up 38% from the third quarter of 2012, and AFFO per share was $1.09, up 38% from the third quarter of 2012.","Moving on to investments and liquidity. During the third quarter, as shown on Slide 16, we've spent $131 million on capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $18 million on our land lease purchase program, $10 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $103 million on revenue-generating capital expenditure, consisting of $74 million on existing sites and $29 million on the construction of new sites, primarily small cell networks. Additionally, during the third quarter we borrowed $800 million of incremental Term Loan B under the existing senior-secured credit agreement with terms substantially the same as our existing Term Loan B. The proceeds were used to pay a portion of the outstanding revolving credit loan. As of September 30, 2013, we had approximately $219 million in cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, and approximately $1.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We ended the third quarter of 2013 with total net debt the last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 6x, at the high end of our targeted level of leverage.","On Slide 17 and 18, we have reflected our updated outlook for 2013. Importantly, we have not included any impact from the AT&T tower transaction in our 2013 outlook. Our revised full year 2013 outlook suggests annual site rental revenue growth of 17% and AFFO growth of 39%.","Also shown on Slide 17 and 18 is our 2014 outlook. Let me spend a minute walking through the key assumptions that we included in our 2014 outlook. We anticipate the AT&T towers will contribute approximately $245 million to $255 million to our 2014 AFFO before financing. Further, we expect approximately $175 million to $185 million of organic cash revenue growth in 2014, ignoring the impact from straight-line revenue adjustment. We expect this $175 million to $185 million of organic cash revenue growth to be comprised equally of new tenant activity and cash escalators. As we noted in the press release, we expect 25% to 30% more revenue from new leases in 2014 than we saw in 2013. Further, we expect that only about 10% of our leasing activity will be covered by the presold leasing arrangement that I mentioned earlier in this call.","In addition, our 2014 outlook for site rental revenue includes the negative impact of churn of approximately $50 million or 2% of our site rental revenue. Approximately half of this amount is typical churn activity and half is from Sprint's decommissioning of their legacy Nextel iDEN network. Based on Sprint's stated intention to decommission their iDEN network and our contractual terms with Sprint, we expect approximately 3% of our run rate site rental revenue to be impacted by the iDEN decommissioning over time. These iDEN leases have effective term end dates spread evenly throughout 2014 and 2015. As a result, we expect the reduction of site rental revenues from the iDEN decommissioning to be approximately 1% in 2014 with the remaining 2% impact coming after 2014. In essence, our expected impact from churn for 2014 is approximately 60% of the cash revenue growth from our contracted lease escalation during the calendar year 2014.","With respect to 2014 adjusted EBITDA, we anticipate that site rental direct expenses and G&A on our existing portfolio of sites will grow approximately 1% from 2013, and the contribution from services gross margin will be approximately $25 million lower than the contribution in 2013. For 2014 AFFO, we expect that the contribution from prepaid rent, net of amortization, will be approximately $20 million higher than that of 2013, reflecting the expected increase in leasing activity and the 33% larger asset base as a result of the AT&T tower transaction. Further, our forecast for 2014 AFFO is negatively impacted by approximately $17 million in expected sustaining capital expenditures to remodel and expand certain of our office facilities, which we would not expect to recur in the foreseeable future. In summary, we expect AFFO per share in 2014 pro forma for the AT&T tower transaction, including the impact of the related expected financing, to be slightly accretive to what our expectation for AFFO per share would have been without this transaction.","Moving to Slide 19. In September, we announced our plans to elect real estate investment trust status commencing January 2014. We are making good progress on the tasks necessary to make this happen. Pursuant to our anticipated REIT conversion and subject to the successful completion and financing of the AT&T tower transaction, we're excited to announce this morning our intention to initiate a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2014.","Given the significant anticipated cash flow from our existing business and future cash flows from the AT&T tower, we expect to be able to continue to make significant investment with our cash flow after dividend in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share. These activities include: investing in acquisition; the construction of new sites, including small cell networks; land purchases; and the purchase of our own securities, including common shares. Based on our expectation for growth in our business, we believe that we can grow our dividend over the next 5 years by at least 15% annually while consuming the vast majority of our net operating losses.","In summary, we are excited about Crown Castle's leadership role in wireless infrastructure. Our announced AT&T tower transaction furthers our focus on the U.S. market and expands our portfolio in the top 100 markets while increasing our expected growth rates of revenue and cash flow. Given the significant pro forma cash flow we expect to generate, we plan to be able to continue to make meaningful investments while providing investors with a regular dividend. We believe we have positioned our company to benefit greatly from the tremendous consumer demand for mobile Internet and data services in the U.S., and the Crown team is ready to deliver the high level of customer experience that the carriers have come to expect from us.","And with that, operator, we'll turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Ric Prentiss from the company Raymond James.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","In a week and the deal's finally official, huh? A couple of questions on it. First, the assumptions on having it be slightly accretive after the financing. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you're looking at cash and the debt, the form of debt and the equity and timing for all those different offerings, given that you want to close it by yearend?","Jay A. Brown","Sure, Ric. I think there's a wide range of options here in terms of what would make the transaction accretive in the short term and also in the long term. For purposes of this call, we're not going to get into any specificity about the portion of the consideration split among cash, equity and debt.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And how about the timing as far as when you would -- the deal closes in fourth quarter, which we're already a good bit through. Would the equity operating be done as well within the fourth quarter?","Jay A. Brown","Ric, we're not going to get, again, to allot specificity around timing or amount, but obviously, we'll need to raise the capital prior to closing the transaction.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then when you guys did the T-Mobile transaction, you mentioned that there would be some G&A impact but also some benefit on your services business. Any need to ramp up G&A, given the size of this portfolio?","Jay A. Brown","There will be. We would expect about $6 million of additional G&A during calendar year 2014 related to staffing the business in order to handle these additional assets. We would expect, at least, as we gave the guidance, that to be completely covered by services. We very well may be able to do better than that, but our assumption was that services gross margin offset the G&A when it gets the EBITDA impact.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And I'll try the defending question right away. Any thoughts about how fast you would want to get back into your target zone of 4 to 6? You mentioned that you're at, obviously, the high end right now.","Jay A. Brown","Yes. I would describe our 4 to 6x as a long-term leverage target ratio, and I think you've seen us operate in and around that level. At times, we've been above it. At other times, we've been slightly below it. So I think it's exactly that. It's not a bright line, but it's a target level of leverage that we would expect to maintain over a long period of time.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Barden from the company Bank of America.","Stephen W. Douglas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Stephen Douglas standing in for David. One question on iDEN. I think in the past, you talked about 3% of revenue exposure coming down kind of ratably over the last 2 years. But it looks like you're expecting that, about 1\/3 of that, in 2014. So I guess could you just talk about some of the moving pieces there and maybe just your conversation with Sprint? And then second, just more of a housekeeping item. What is the kind of maintenance CapEx assumptions that you're baking in for that $245 million to $255 million AFFO contribution from the AT&T deal?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. Stephen, on the first question, as we think about the iDEN exposure that we have, Sprint has the right, ratably, as you stated correctly, over 2014 and 2015 to not renew leases as they come to their effectual term end date. We won't know ultimately how many of those get renewed or not until we reach those dates. So purposes -- for our purposes, what we've assumed -- when I speak to the 1% in calendar year 2014, we've assumed that none of the leases, none of the iDEN leases that come to their effectual terms end date during 2014 are renewed. Obviously any lease that is renewed in the latter half of -- that is not renewed in the latter half of 2014, we don't see a full year impact. So there's a bit of a laddering of the impact to revenues during calendar year 2014 than 2015, and then we would see a tail of it in 2016. It's the licenses that are canceled in the latter half of 2015. If they are, we would see the full impact of the site rental revenue line in 2016. With regards to your second question, we've assumed about $6 million roughly of maintenance CapEx related to the asset. I mentioned in my prepared remarks the investment that we're making to expand some of our office facilities and remodel. Those costs should be for -- only in calendar year 2014. I wouldn't expect those to recur, at least in the foreseeable future. But $6 million increase that you can see in the forecast, we would expect that to recur and that's related directly to these assets.","Operator","And our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jay, a quick one on the guidance. Services gross margin, you have that down $25 million in '14. Are you just being conservative there? Obviously, you had another strong services quarter. How should we think about the visibility into that? And then, Ben, I know you talked a bit about densification. We've heard a lot about this at the tower show the other day. Can you get into a little bit more color on what you're seeing from some of the carriers? Verizon talked a lot about AWS just last week, and Sprint's progress on Clearwire.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure, Simon. First of all, it is October, and our tradition is being conservative on services guidance, and we've been wrong for a number of years on that, I'm happy to report. But I would remind everybody that, that is a business that, while has grown significantly, is different than the recurring site rental business. So we have necessarily taken a little bit of a haircut to 2013 levels. And as we mentioned, about $25 million year-over-year down would be our assumption in this guidance. Your question I'll anticipate would be, \"Well, gee, with this additional portfolio, wouldn't that augment probably your opportunity on the services side?\" to which, I would acknowledge. But at the same time, we do are seeing a significant mix change towards co-locations, as Jay mentioned. So we're a little conservative on that outlook right now, and we'll continue to see how well we can do. On the Verizon and AT&T and other -- the Big 4 carriers, in terms of the leasing mix this year and what we're seeing, we have seen a dramatic shift this year in leasing. And as Jay mentioned, our outlook for 2014 is about 90% of our revenue going forward, of our incremental revenue is occurring on either through co-locations or amendments that are falling outside of these presold agreements that we have with several of the carriers. A significant portion of that is made up through co-location activity or network densification, if you will, as the initial path of LTE goes through these markets and as the carriers have eloquently explained, these networks are supply-constrained, if you will. And so as soon as a site is essentially turned up very shortly thereafter, they're looking at network densification or cell splitting, which, in many times, is co-location on an existing tower, where they have not previously been. So we're continuing to see a significant and ramping component of that, like we saw years ago, as other generations of technologies rolled out, and it's nice to see. It has started, principally, with Verizon and AT&T but we would expect over time as the Sprint LTE and T-Mobile LTE build, go through the markets, that they will see a similar experience where they'll need to densify these networks and come back and cell split. And certainly the capital commitment that all 4 companies are making to the industry right now would suggest that we're going to see significant growth in that regard for some time in the future.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And any Clearwire activity?","W. Benjamin Moreland","No. No, that's basically yet to come at the Clearwire's spectrum being re-purposed from the Sprint Network Vision upgrades, if you will. That's still in the planning stages, but something that we anticipate is coming very soon through the upgrades on the Network Vision sites.","Operator","And the next question comes from Brett Feldman from Deutsche Bank.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm going to take another stab at Ric's just for fun. You put in place a $3.4 billion bridge loan that was disclosed in the 8-K this morning. Should we be thinking about that as the upper end of how much debt you're thinking about for this deal? Because you also mentioned you still have cash in the revolver. I'll start with that one and see how far I get.","Jay A. Brown","Brett, I think at that upper end from the disclosure in the 8-K, I think that is the upper end, which is basically our leverage ratio that we have in our existing debt agreement. And you could run through that calculation. I think that's the upper end. I think beyond that, well, I'll -- as I did with Ric's question, I think I'll pass on being any more specific around our financing plan.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's fair enough. Just a point of clarification, the additional usage rights that AT&T has in tower, that's covered by the payment term, it's 1,900 and 2%, correct? They don't pay extra as long as they stay within that scope of usage?","W. Benjamin Moreland","That's correct, Brett. We're not going to get into all the details, but I would say that it's consistent with other transactions we've done where they have existing capacity on the site plus some reserve for future growth. But at the same time, they've requested and we've negotiated a rate card for equipment that they would contemplate potentially adding over time that would result in additional equipment beyond this reserve capacity and the additional rent to go with it. So for planning purposes, to be honest, in the near term, I wouldn't suggest to you that's going to be a significant revenue event for us, but longer term, we'll have to see what their needs actually are on the sites. And most importantly, in a transaction like this, we have not encumbered the sites that we'd be leasing to prevent us from adding co-location to these sites, whether on the tower or on the ground. So we are very confident in our ability, as we have with the other transactions we've completed over the years, add additional tenants to these sites, and that's obviously where the real value driver is in these types of transactions.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So one last one, if you don't mind. How did you settle on the 2% escalator? I think you've most recently been doing CTI in large deals. And historically, you've been more 3.5%. I'm just wondering if that's something you're going to be looking to apply to more leases going forward.","W. Benjamin Moreland","I wouldn't anticipate it. This was a competitive process and a requirement that AT&T wanted to see in their MLA here with us on this transaction specifically. And so we were -- we, obviously, priced that into how we thought about the economics of the transaction. But I wouldn't anticipate that would be the case going forward.","Operator","And the next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a follow-up on Brett's prior questions. On the reserve capacity, I guess, what I'm trying to understand is do you feel comfortable that there's additional upside potential longer term here based on the scope of the reserve that you've struck with AT&T? Just trying to understand sort of what you've seen historically with these types of contracts and how we should think about further opportunities down the line.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure. The short answer is yes, we do see additional upside, and that has been our experience over time when we have reserve capacity or presold agreements or however they've been structured over time, is that there's certainly a period where they use the reserve capacity that they've negotiated, and then over time depending upon what equipment requirements are and subsequent generations of technologies. And that's the very reason why we have a preexisting rate card negotiated in this transaction. Both parties know what the pricing on that would be to the extent they need capacity above their reserve capacity, and that's been our experience over many years. So that ultimately does come into play.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And if I may, one more follow-up. What type of investment may be required on these types of assets in order to drive additional co-location opportunities? It seemed like from some of the discussions at the recent tower trade show, there have been some varied opinions in terms of the qualities of the towers. So I'd love to hear sort of your viewpoint there.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure, Amir, the -- and thanks for that question. That's -- our experience has been very positive on these carrier-located towers. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, fundamentally, this is a real estate business in our view. And location of the asset is the primary driver along with the ability to execute for customers and do all the other things that we work on very hard every day. We've gotten pretty good at adding capacity to these towers. As Jay mentioned, our expectation on this transaction is there's at least one tenant of additional capacity on these sites without significantly more investment. But even where there is additional investment required over time, as there has been in others that we've acquired, those turn out to be fantastic investments. And as you can see depicted in our slides, well, I think for the first time in a long time, we've broken out the yields that we've accomplished, the growth in yields from the original transaction with carrier towers. They're roughly quadrupled what we originally acquired the sites over a decade ago. And so the experience has been one where we add yield. We certainly add net -- structural capacity where required. That takes additional investment. Very often that is significantly shared with the carrier adding that tenant on the tower. But over time, we have a track record of adding significantly to the yield on these sites, and we'd expect that to be the case here.","Operator","And the following question is from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two, if I could. First, in terms of the AT&T towers, is it fair to assume that the rate that AT&T is paying is equivalent or in the range of what the other 0.7 tenants per tower is paying? That is, if we think about the 1,900, can we extrapolate out to figure out what the site leasing revenue from the entire portfolio would look like, maybe somewhere in the $375 million range? And then a second question, is there any iDEN or PCS exposure or different MLAs that applies to the AT&T towers that we should be aware of?","Jay A. Brown","Sure, Jonathan. On your first question, in terms of the other tenants that are on the tower, their terms do look like market rates both in terms of the amounts they pay per month, as well as their escalation provision. There is approximately, including AT&T's, the rent we would expect to collect from AT&T next year, there's approximately a little over $400 million of total revenue from the AT&T towers portfolio. And as I mentioned the terms of the other tenants are on market terms. That would be true also for the iDEN exposure that is there. There is a little bit, but it's fairly minimal. We think maybe over the next couple of years, that would be about $5 million roughly, would be our impact from that. I would point out to you in the comments that I made earlier around our churn, both in calendar year 2014 and beyond, those numbers that I gave you in terms of the impact include any churn that we would expect from these AT&T towers with regards to iDEN.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. And maybe even one last shot at the financing. Do these towers look like they are prepared for securitization?","Jay A. Brown","Certainly anytime that we negotiate these agreements, we think about long-term financing capabilities of the assets. And this structure is one that we are able to finance, if we should choose to go down the path of doing a secured transaction like what we've done in the past. And obviously, we've done securitizations on assets that are in a similar structure as to what these are.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Smithen from Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","You've got into an initial 1.8% dividend yield and 15%-plus, 5-year dividend growth. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the impact of your remaining NOLs on that and how that will -- how we should think about the compounding of the dividend and the growth. Is this going to be a hockey stick once the NOLs expire or are utilized, can get to significantly greater than 15% based on a 70% payout on 2016 x NOLs, AFFO?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, Kevin. This is Ben. We had to start somewhere. And this payout is a little bit less than 1\/3 of AFFO guidance for 2014. We think it's a meaningful start on the dividend path, as you suggest, but gives us plenty of flexibility to allocate capital for growth-enhancing investments over time. We've put the 15% -- at least 15% growth out there as a target, as an expectation. But as you rightly point out, over time, as we consume the NOL, as it's currently sheltering that income, but as net income rises and we consume the NOL, once that's close to exhausted, we would have a much more significant payout over time. And if you extrapolate that out, you can pretty easily get to the 15% growth over time. And that final payout ratio, once we're a full dividend payer with no NOL shelter, is probably in the 75% range of AFFO. So a very significant payout coming. It was just a lively debate that we had among ourselves and with some friendly shareholders who were not shy about giving us their opinion on where we should start this dividend and the path that it should take as we get to the inevitability of a very high payout ratio probably in the next 3 or 4 years.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","So will you grow dividends 15% while you still have some NOLs, let's call it, 2015, maybe 2016? Or is that 15%, a 5-year CAGR number?","W. Benjamin Moreland","It's meant to be a 5-year CAGR, so it would be compounding over time. That's our anticipation as we start this process.","Operator","And the next question comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Jay, a couple of questions. It looks like you're guiding next year for organic cash revenue growth around 8%, if you were to normalize the iDEN. Am I thinking about that right? And maybe what was your organic cash revenue growth here this quarter? And then just a rough idea on that future option payment that -- how you're kind of thinking what the net present value of that is.","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On your first question, Tim, you've got it exactly right. Our embedded organic growth -- if you think about it on a same tower sales basis, was right at about 8%, that's about 25% to 30% more than what we expect for our full year 2013 outlook and is a reflection of both an increase in absolute level of activity, as well as the mix shift that I spoke about in terms of what percentage is covered by our presold leasing arrangement. And as we expect, in 2014, only 10% of that activity, we think, is going to be -- come from this presold leasing arrangement. So there is a significant amount of additional growth in that 8% organic growth, about 4%, about roughly or a little over 4%, 4% to 5% is coming from new leasing activity; and then the balance coming from cash escalations, a little over 3% coming from cash escalations. And then, as I mentioned, the offset to that, the churn amounts are about 60% of the cash benefit from escalations. So that should bridge the growth we expect in organic cash revenues in the next calendar year.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And the net present value, how you're thinking about the future payment, 28 years out or so.","Jay A. Brown","Yes. I think there's a bunch of different ways to think about it. Depending on how you view the cost of capital, whether you use a blended rate or if you assume we keep balance sheet appropriately levered over the term, I think it will add about, if you want to bring it back to present value, about 1\/2 the churn, a little over 1 churn to be -- to the purchase price that was paid is probably the right way to think about it.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. And lastly, are you seeing much interest from REIT investors at this point given the announcement? Have you had an acceleration there?","Jay A. Brown","Certainly since September, we've had a number of conversations with REIT investors as we put out our announcement that are -- we intended to convert -- we intend to convert in September. It's a little early this morning to get any feedback on our dividend announcement but I would imagine that over the coming days, we'll be having significant conversations over the coming month.","Operator","And the next question comes from Michael Bowen from Pacific Crest.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple questions, if I may. With regard to the tower portfolio you acquired, I think a press release said that nearly half are in the top 50 markets. If I recall, T-Mobile, those towers that you had acquired, 72% were in the top 50. Can you help us in -- what is the significance of that from either a current or a future site leasing revenue opportunity, and how did you guys think about that? And then secondly, I think you said in the release that AT&T has an average term commitment of 10 years for their monthly rent. Can you give us an idea of what the average term is of the other tenants on the site?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure, Mike. The concentration of the top 100 markets and the top 50 markets is sort of a fundamental driver in our business. And it goes to the statement I made earlier about location being the primary driver of leasing. And so as we look at our company pro forma, we'll be about 72% in the top 100 or about 28,000 sites. And a little over 50% of this portfolio was actually in the top 50 markets. So it certainly met our criteria for concentration in urban markets, where network enhancements are obviously most required, where the population lives and where the consumption of network capacity is the greatest. And so this certainly met all of those hurdles for us internally. The -- their -- you're correct. Their -- AT&T's commitment on their communications facilities on these sites will be 10 years, and the co-locations that exist today, the 0.7 additional tenants per tower are on a variety of terms, 5 to 10 years, with typically multiple renewal options that would be customary in the industry.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And just as a quick follow-up. Do you think that given this portfolio is in a lower percentage of the top 50 markets, is there any difference do you think, in the future growth of the site leasing revenue versus the T-Mobile portfolio?","W. Benjamin Moreland","We don't think so. We think at some level, you get down to sort of splitting hairs, and we think these are certainly well-located sites, with an urban and suburban concentration that, given our experience in our own portfolio, it would certainly suggest that there's significant leasing opportunities still to come.","Jay A. Brown","I think, Michael, you could also look at the 4 carriers transactions that we presented on the slides and that Ben was -- during his prepared remarks. You could see on the slides the 4 carriers transactions that we did going back a decade ago. The percentage in the top 100 markets is very similar to what we acquired here in this AT&T tower transaction. And so I think that would be a good comparison, if you're trying to do it on an apples-to-apples basis.","Operator","And the next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of follow-ups. One, on the 2% escalator, can you provide what percent of your total revenues have a CPI or a lower fixed escalator at this point? And how does that compare to the ground lease increases you see every year?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On our tenant revenue side, we have about 10% to 15% of our consolidated leases that have some types of CPI. Either they may have an absolute outright CPI, some of them may have a CPI with a cap or CPI with a floor. On the ground lease side, it's about 25% of the leases that have a CPI-type escalator. Again, many of those would have a cap or have a floor embedded in them. Over the last several years, just in terms of the cash component of that, at the cash level with regards to revenue, we've been averaging over 3.5% of benefit from the escalation, and that would be total escalations including CPI. And then on the ground lease side, those have been right at about 3% over the last several years.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And one question on Clearwire. You mentioned that Clearwire activity is yet to come. Should we assume that you did not include much of that in your '14 guidance?","Jay A. Brown","We did not include that in our 2014 outlook.","Operator","The next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","For guidance for this year, you had indicated that you're expecting prepaid rents of $167 million to $182 million. I was wondering if there was a comparable number for 2014. And then on that same topic, I was wondering if you could talk about your expectations for augmentation for the AT&T in towers in 2014, and I guess, even beyond, just recognizing that there's only availability for 1 tenant. And then the just as a quick follow-up, in terms of interest rates on debt, I wonder if you can just give us an idea of what you would expect, whether it was unsecured or secured debt, the type of interest rate you would get, so regardless of how much you ultimately end up raising, since I know you don't want to talk about that right now, maybe just what the interest rate you would assume would be.","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On the first question, the prepaid rent component is a direct function of the leasing that we do on the assets and the need for investment of CapEx in order to improve the asset for additional co-location. And so the increase, which we've shown in the -- inside a press release, the increase that you see there is a result of those 2 components, including the AT&T assets. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, in 2014, we expect the benefit from that to be about $20 million roughly. And that ties really to your second portion of your question around the augmentation CapEx that we would expect on the AT&T assets. It's very similar. We've made an assumption that's very similar to what we had seen on our own portfolio. And we would expect, as Ben mentioned earlier in the conversation, we would expect the vast majority of that to be reimbursed by the tenants, let's say, as they go on to the site, a component of the leasing arrangement that we have with them is that they provide and reimburse us for any capital necessary to improve the site to hold their equipment. On the last question, I think you can see from our public filings where our cost is under our revolving credit facility today, given where rates are, the cost of that between 2.5% and 2.75%. Our holding company bonds are trading just over 6% currently or around 6%. So I'll leave it to you to make your own assumptions around the various components that we use, but that's the range of where our debt instruments are. And obviously, depending on the type of structure and the duration, the numbers could move, but that at least should bound it some level of ranges.","Operator","There's one last question, coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP","Two quick questions, if I may. Firstly, on the iDEN decommissioning is -- we're hearing from Sprint now talking about more openly about needing a lot more core Network Vision sites than the 38,000 that they had initially targeted. Is there any benefit for them extending existing iDEN leases that they have with you, maybe in different locations from where those initial leases were situated as opposed to letting those leases expire and striking brand-new leases with you? And then the second question is just on the sort of composition of revenues and the composition of the opportunity on the towers you've just acquired. It seems like if we assume that the towers are capable of carrying 4 tenants, that AT&T has reserved -- either it has consumed or has reserved about half of the capacity on those towers for themselves. I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about it correctly.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. Let me start with your second statement first, just so we can clear that up. No, we wouldn't -- we didn't and haven't suggested that: Number one, that these are 4-tenant towers; or number two, they've consumed half the capacity. So let's just start over with that. I think it's important, and we can even go back to Colby's question previous. Our assumption for modeling purposes and planning in a medium-term accretion analysis is sort of what does it take to believe [ph] to get an additional tenant per tower over time. But that, by no means, is the outside boundary. And you look at what we've done on the sites we've owned over the last 12 years, and they have significantly more than 1 additional tenant per tower in many, many cases. So it's -- as we affectionately refer to right here, there's nothing that an additional capital investment won't cure, typically at a very high return on investment when you have additional revenue coming on the sites. And we would not suggest to you that the AT&T reserve space is the equivalent of effectively half the tower over time. But, Jon, let me go back to your first point because I think it's a good one, and it's -- it would be -- it's a little bit speculative on our part because, as you know, Sprint right now with Network Vision and we as a counter-party are working very hard to get their Network Vision sites upgraded on their existing sites for their LTE launch that's ongoing. And so that is really our focus, and I think it's their focus for the time being. As you move out through 2014 and potentially into 2015, it's logical to assume, based on what we're seeing with other carriers that are further along in their LTE deployment, that you'll see network densification requirements, and they're talking about needing additional cell sites. Are those typically -- would those happen to be some LTE, I mean, some iDEN installations that they currently have? Potentially. I can't, for the moment, tell you what that would be or how many. And for planning purposes, we've given you the full amount of the scope of what we think that churn event could be over time. That's 3% of revenue, starting with 1% in 2014 and rolling forward, as Jay mentioned. But certainly as you think about it in the back of your mind and walking through the sequencing of events, you could see some of the sites, perhaps, in the latter part of that 2 years be re-purposed. And we'll just have to wait and see on that one.","But I think we need to wrap up this call. We're right on an hour. Again I really want to express my appreciation to those of you who jump on the call early with us this morning on very short notice. It's not our custom, as you know, but we wanted to get the news out quickly over the weekend and then -- and follow it up with our earnings call and '14 guidance and the dividend. And so we've got a lot for you to digest this morning and the merits of this very large and significant transaction that we've announced today. We are thrilled to death to be going forward and expanding our relationship with AT&T. Again, I want to extend my appreciation to the professionals on the AT&T side that worked with us to get us to this announcement last night. We've got a lot of work to do internally. We're getting pretty good at integrating assets, and we are really excited to move forward into this environment of expanded relationship with AT&T and look towards closing in the fourth quarter.","So thanks again to everybody for joining us this morning, and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ben Lowe, Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead sir.","Ben Lowe","Great. Thank you, Todd and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our second quarter 2019 results. With me on the call this morning are Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.","To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com that we will refer to throughout the call this morning. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors sections of the company's SEC filings.","Our statements are made as of today July 18th, 2019 and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. In addition today's call includes the discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.","So, with that, let me turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Brown","Thanks Ben and thank you everyone for joining us on the call this morning. We delivered another quarter of great financial results that exceeded our expectations and reflect the significant demand we are seeing from our shared infrastructure assets.","I believe our strategy and unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers and approximately 75,000 route miles of fiber concentrated in the top U.S. markets has positioned Crown Castle to generate growth in cash flows and dividends per share both in the near term and for years to come.","Due in large part to the increasing demand we are seeing across our tower assets, we are increasing our full year 2019 outlook and now expect to grow AFFO per share by approximately 8%, which is at the high end of our longer term target of 7% to 8% annual growth.","Dan will discuss the results for the quarter and the increased outlook in more detail, so I'll focus my comments this morning on two key points. First, tower -- current tower leasing activity is our highest in more than a decade which we expect will carry into next year; and second, our small cell business is delivering compelling returns at scale.","On the first point, we are seeing a more significant acceleration in tower leasing this year than we previously expected with broad demand from each of our largest customers as they deploy additional cell sites and spectrum in response to the rapid growth in mobile data traffic.","We now expect new leasing activity on towers to be approximately 30% higher when compared to the level of leasing last year with activity in the back half of the year exceeding the growth generated year-to-date.","And I believe the current level of activity will continue as our customers respond to data traffic growth on their 4G networks, while also embarking on the deployment of 5G. According to a recent report from Ericsson, data traffic per smartphone in North America is expected to increase from seven gigabytes per month in 2018 to nearly 40 gigabytes per month by 2024, representing the highest rate of data consumption in the world and a compound annual growth rate of more than 30%.","Additionally, as 5G becomes a reality, new use cases will develop that require wireless networks to connect not only people and their phones, but also billions of things. The expansion of the uses of wireless networks will require ubiquitous, low latency, high speed connectivity, which we believe will extend demand for our towers for many years to come.","In addition to towers remaining a crucial element of the future, networks will need to be significantly more dense than current infrastructure can handle, which brings me to my second key point. As you see on the map on slide 4, we invested early and at scale to build and acquire fiber in the most densely populated markets where small cells are being deployed and demand is expected to be the greatest. Said another way, all the gray space you see on the map where we don't have fiber is intentional.","Turning to slide 5. This strategy is delivering compelling results. The small cell project summarized on this slide are in the process of being completed. While the projects included in this data set are not finished, some of the nodes within those projects are on air while other nodes are in various stages of construction.","In total, this analysis represents approximately 75% of the 65,000 nodes we have on air or under construction and represent the most recent data points for measuring returns. When these projects are complete, we expect to have invested just over $2 billion of capital, both to build new systems for anchor tenants and to co-locate new small cells on existing fiber networks. These projects are expected to generate a recurring yield of approximately 8%, the blend of first tenant economics in the 6% to 7% range and co-location economics of approximately 20%, which is consistent with our disciplined underwriting requirements.","As the data shows, similar to the development of the tower business, we are seeing significant demand from multiple customers for the same asset, which results in co-location economics. The small cell co-location on existing fiber accounts for nearly 30% of the incremental cash flows we expect to generate from these projects, but only 10% of the incremental capital investment.","This operating and capital leverage is very much like what the tower business has exhibited over time, and we believe our strategy of investing early in fiber for small cells will pay off in much the same way that our early investment in towers continues to. And whether we have built or acquired the fiber, we are seeing co-location economics as we add small cell customers to the existing fiber.","To that end, approximately 75% of the co-location activity is coming from the markets where we acquired the fiber in recent years. While our levels of activity, initial yields, and lease-up economics are all very encouraging, the significant increase in the volume of small cells being constructed is straining the response times from municipalities and utilities who are not complying with the FCC orders, resulting in longer construction timelines than we previously experienced.","As a result, we are seeing construction timelines averaging 18 to 36 months, which is longer than our prior average of 18 to 24 months. Due to the elongated construction timelines, we now expect to deploy approximately 10,000 small cells in 2019, which is at the low end of our prior expected range of 10,000 to 15,000 in this year but it's approximately 30% more than what we delivered all of 2018.","In the near term we expect the delay to reduce our 2019 new leasing activity from small cells by approximately $5 million. Longer term, we do not expect the extended timelines to impact our overall growth or our returns.","Taking a step back and reflecting on where we are with our fiber and small cell strategy, it is remarkable to me how much progress we have made in a relatively short time frame. What began about 10 years ago with measured investments intended to explore the small cell opportunity has accelerated over the past five years at the scale of the opportunity and the business model have come into focus. As a result, we sit here today as the clear leader in the small cell industry with approximately 75,000 route miles of high-capacity fiber concentrated in top markets, more than 65,000 small cells on air or under construction, more than $13 billion of invested capital generating a recurring yield of approximately 8%, and a robust pipeline of small cell projects that will add to the returns on our current fiber asset base, while increasing the longer-term opportunity as we expand with new anchor builds.","As we look ahead, we see tremendous opportunity to increase the returns on our fiber investments over time by adding small cell tenants to existing fiber networks as we we're doing today. Along these lines, our experience is that the same fiber necessary to support small cell customers can serve large enterprises and government agencies who require high-bandwidth connectivity. ","As such, we see a path to further improve our small cell returns by sharing the fiber across these customers. This is similar to our approach with towers, where the vast majority of the economics are driven by a wireless carrier. But we also work hard to increase the returns on our towers by sharing the asset with others.","As shown in our 2019 outlook, we now anticipate fiber solutions revenues to grow approximately 3%, or approximately $15 million lower than our previous expectation. As you would expect, we prioritized activities related to our long-term strategy of adding small cells to our fiber, including integrating recent acquisitions into a single operating structure and platform, and consequently we lost some sales momentum in this business.","While we want to generate as much revenues from these sources as possible, we continue to believe that the growth from small cells will be the primary driver of future return on our fiber investment.","So to wrap-up and moving back to the collective outcome, 2019 is shaping up to be another great year for Crown Castle with AFFO per share growth now expected to be at the high-end of our longer term 7% to 8% target. We see the growth in our business reflecting the positive underlying fundamentals driving demand for our infrastructure, including the continued growth in mobile data on existing 4G networks, and the early stages of our customers developing 5G networks. With our unmatched asset base and expertise, I believe Crown Castle is in a great position to capture these substantial long-term return opportunities and consistently return capital to shareholders through a high-quality dividend that we expect to grow at 7% to 8% annually.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schlanger","Thanks, Jay and good morning everyone. As Jay discussed, we delivered another quarter of very good growth, reflecting the strong demand for our unmatched portfolio of towers, small cells to fiber assets.","Turning to slide 6, you can see, we had a great quarter with site rental revenues increasing 6%, adjusted EBITDA increasing 12%, and AFFO increasing 14% when compared to the same period a year ago.","On page 7, you can see that at the midpoint, we are increasing our full year outlook for site rental revenues by approximately $3 million for adjusted EBITDA by approximately $41 million and for AFFO by approximately $43 million when compared to our prior outlook.","Our AFFO guidance for 2019 implies approximately $5.94 per share, representing 8% growth compared to 2018 and an increase from our prior outlook of 7% growth. The increase to full year 2019 outlook for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO primarily reflects the higher expected contribution from straight-lined revenues and an increase in the expected contribution from services, both of which relate to higher expected tower activity in 2019 as compared to the prior full year 2019 outlook. The increase in full year AFFO also reflects reduction and expected full year financing costs.","Turning to page 8. We now expect between $245 million and $275 million of organic contribution to site rental revenues, reflecting an increase in the expected contribution from towers, offset by lower expected contribution from both small cells and fiber solutions.","New leasing activity is expected to contribute between $345 million and $375 million to organic contribution to site rental revenues, which is approximately $5 million lower than our prior outlook. At the midpoint, new leasing activity consists of $140 million from towers compared to $125 million in our prior outlook, $70 million from small cells compared to the prior $75 million and $150 million from fiber solutions compared to the prior $165 million.","Turning to page 9. You'll find our 2019 outlook for components of AFFO growth. The increase in full year outlook for AFFO growth reflects the increase in the expected contribution from services tied to higher tower activity and a reduction in expected full year financing cost resulting from lower interest rates and recent financing activities. These improvements were offset by the reduction in organic contribution to site rental revenues and additional expenses primarily related to incremental incentive compensation tied to our improved outlook.","From a balance sheet perspective, in the second quarter we continue to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity by increasing new commitments under our revolver to $5 billion and extending the maturity date on our credit facility to a new five-year term.","As we have previously discussed, we intend to finance the business with approximately fiver turns of leverage longer term, consistent with both our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile in the level at which we finished the second quarter.","So in closing, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations, leading us to increase our full year guidance for 2019 across site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. We continue to believe our ability to offer towers, small cells and fiber, which are all integral components of communications networks, provides us the best opportunity to generate significant growth while delivering high returns for our shareholders.","With that, Todd, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Barden of Bank of America.","David Barden","Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess a couple. First, the services business is really strong this quarter. I was wondering if you could call out anything that you thought was kind of maybe a recurring driver or a one-off driver of that business activity in the quarter, and kind of maybe some thoughts on how it kind of plays out for the year?","And then the second piece is just on the other side of it that you kind of called out the fiber services piece. I think there was a cogent explanation for small cells maybe kind of being tougher because of the utilities and the municipalities being strained to kind of come to terms with the volumes. But the fiber business seems to just kind of keep getting a little weaker. This time, it was bookings and I was wondering if you can kind of give us some color on what the game plan is for that business. Is it secular forces? Is it sales problems? Is it -- I don't know SD WAN? If you can kind of elaborate a little bit on what's going on with that business, it would be great. Thank you.","Jay Brown","Sure Dave. On your first question around the services business being strong, I think that's the best reflection of what we're seeing in terms of the tower leasing activity that we talked about.","If you look at the activity, we're talking about for full year 2019; we're up about 30% year-over-year. That's a direct reflection of that is what happens inside of the services business. If you look at it year-over-year and the first half of the year, I think it's up almost 50% year-over-year. So, the tower activity is indicated by the results on the services side.","And as we\u2019ve said historically, we think that, that activity will match leasing activity. And so if we stay at an elevated level of leasing activities than the services business we would expect would continue to do so and our outlook for the year sort of reflects that.","On your second question around fiber solutions, I made reference to this in my comments, but as we went through the acquisition activities, we initially focused on making sure we got the assets integrated and purpose-ready for our long-term strategy of small cells. I think given that we've gotten that behind us, it's certainly appropriate for a little more attention to be paid on the sales side around fiber solutions.","But I really don't believe that long-term this is the best indication of value in that business. The way that we underwrote the investment in fiber was based on our view around small cells and the need for this kind of fiber to be available for small cells. Fiber solutions revenues support some level of return there, but the long-term returns and the driver of long-term returns are going to come from the wireless business and be driven by small cells.","And as I look at the environment for that today, it's healthier and more robust and better visibility than what we had frankly when we were making these fiber investments over the last several years. So, from an underlying thesis around fiber, I think we feel like we're in a better place today than we were several years ago when we made the investments and certainly have a lot more data points to support that view as we're talking about in the 75% of the 65,000 nodes that we have on air or under construction.","David Barden","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery","Thanks very much. Good morning. On the tower leasing, could you give us a little bit more color around where you're seeing the strength? I think you said it was very fairly broad-based, and I think from beyond the big four carriers, how's the mix between colo and amendment activity? And then the sort of are you seeing this in suburbia or other areas which are very broad-based? Any color around what the big theme is driving the new activity is? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Sure. Simon, good morning. On the drivers there, we're seeing that across the board from the wireless operators. And their activity is a mix of densifying the network, improving their network, and deploying additional spectrum. Given the nature of our assets, which are more focused in the metro markets than rural, we're seeing that activity happen in the metro market. That may be just by virtue of the nature of our assets and our bias towards being in the metro market in terms of the location of the current asset base.","We've seen the increase in activity come from both first-time installs as well as amendments. Both of those boats are rising with the tide, so the mix has stayed relatively similar to what we've seen over the last couple of years. We are at about 40% first-time installs and about 60% of the activity being driven by amendment. And that's pretty similar to what it's been over the last several years.","To your question around outside of the wireless carriers, yes we are seeing some increase there, but the majority of the driver here has continued to be the wireless operators, and we're benefiting from a little bit of activity outside of those wireless operators, makes up about 15% of our overall activity, 85% coming from the wireless carriers. ","Simon Flannery","Great. So you're \u2013 and just to be clear you think your second half leasing activity will be ahead of the first half? So you'll exit the year accelerating from the full year number?","Jay Brown","That's correct.","Simon Flannery","Yeah, great. Thank you.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. The statistics you've been giving us, 65,000 small cells that are on-air or in the backlog, it's been a pretty stable number now for the last two quarters, which implies there has not been a lot of new booking activity through the first half of the year off of what had been fairly active in 2018. So I was hoping maybe you can just help us understand what the demand environment is like, what the small cell opportunity funnel looks like as you go into the second half, and should we expect that there will be a pick up in bookings as we move through the remainder of the year? Thank you.","Jay Brown","Yeah, Brett good morning. As you've seen in the past, the activity of new bookings is very lumpy. They come in very large scale projects with a number of nodes that take as I was talking about in my earlier comments long period of time to construct.","So as I look across the horizon there are a ton of opportunities that we see for continuing to add bookings. But the amount of work that goes into even preparing and designing to get to the place where we have bookings is a pretty significant period of time. And that activity is as robust as we've ever seen it. We're seeing activity from all of the carriers as they look at deploying small cells and I think we will at some point see that overall number continue to increase.","Brett Feldman","Is there any change in the environment in terms of your customers particularly your largest ones deciding to do more of this in-house? Or is it really just the timeline factored that you outlined?","Jay Brown","It's just the timeline factor that we've outlined. We haven't seen any movement towards greater self-perform than what we've seen historically. We continue to believe that broadly at the market we're capturing about 50% of the total activity and of the total small cell activity and the balance of it would be done mostly in self perform and then some components of third-party providers.","Brett Feldman","Great. Thank you.","Jay Brown","You bet\u2026","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Richard Prentiss of Raymond James.","Richard Prentiss","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jay Brown","Good morning.","Richard Prentiss","Hey. Want to follow-up on a couple of Brett's question as well. Can you update us as far as roughly how many of the nodes you have on-air versus how many are in the backlog?","Jay Brown","We're a little under 40,000 nodes on-air and then the balance would be in backlog, Ric.","Richard Prentiss","Makes sense. And then with the slip out from the 18 to 24 to be 18 to 36, how should we think about the bulk of that backlog pacing it into beyond 2019 and to 2020 and 2021?","Jay Brown","Yeah. I think based on what we're seeing at the moment the best guidance, I could give you is to expect that we'll put about 10,000 nodes on air annually or 2,500 roughly per quarter, which would suggest that the backlog that we have now carries us through 2020 and 2021. And so it gives us really good visibility around revenue growth in small cells over those couple of year period of time. And the works that we're doing around attracting new bookings would be related to revenue growth in 2022 and beyond.","Richard Prentiss","Makes sense. And then also I notice this quarter, I think there was a sequential drop quarter-to-quarter on the fiber small cell operating cost. Is there anything seasonally there? Or is it something to do with the weaker sales bookings on the fiber side? So just trying to think as we look at the gross margin side on fiber small cells as a segment.","Jay Brown","No. I think there's not a lot to be gained from trying to compare those two directly Ric. As you pointed out, yeah, there's going to be some lower cost with lower bookings, but that's not going to be a huge driver of the business. I think what I would say is, there's always going to be timing for when cost come-in and when revenue comes in that will move margins around a little bit. But I think overall, what we think is that the margins that we're providing in that market in that business right now are ones that we think will continue overtime. With small fluctuations here and there, but I don't think you can take anything from the \u2013 from the sequential movement to give a sense for what could be extrapolated into a long period.","Richard Prentiss","And final one for me. I think Jay you mentioned, the straight-line adjustment \u2013 it might have been Dan mentioning the straight-line adjustment did modify in the quarter. Was that really just the new leasing activity? So I'm just trying to think as we look out into 2019 and 2020 what we should be thinking about straight-line we're probably looking at straight-line flipping colors at some point.","Dan Schlanger","Yeah. It's actually combination of the new leasing activity and extensions on current leases that we have. So it's a combination of things we've talked about in the past as well Ric, just continuing. And because the activity continues to accelerate, we're continuing to see an acceleration of that straight-line revenue.","Richard Prentiss","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. This is Jon on for Colby. Thanks for taking the questions. Within the small-cell business you noted longer construction time frames, especially in the top markets. Are you starting to see demand beyond those very top markets? And then within the fiber solutions business, are you seeing any notable change in the demand environment there or from competition? Thank you.","Jay Brown","Yeah, Jon. On your first question, what I would say is the vast majority of the activity and conversations are continuing to happen in the top 30 markets in the U.S. It's where we've invested thus far, the vast majority of the capital, frankly you could probably even narrow it down to the top 10 markets, the vast majority of the capital would be investments in the top 10 markets and it continues to be the biggest focus around the need to densify the networks and bring small cells on-air. So the focus continues to be there. We expand out beyond the top 10 top 30 markets. There is some limited amounts of activity in those markets, but not meaningful in terms of margin opportunities or investment of CapEx.","I think, longer term, as I listen to what the carriers are talking about their networks, depending on which carrier is talking about their networks, they talk about top 100 and in some cases all the way out to the top 250 markets in the U.S. So I think you're going to see the need for small cells well beyond the top 30 markets in the U.S.","And ultimately whether we decide to play in that market will be determined based on the returns and what we believe the co-location opportunities are around fiber and markets beyond the top 30. At this point and as we've talked about the pipeline, we've got several years worth of visibility where we know the activity is going to be coming in the top 30 markets.","So I think at this point, that's the majority of the focus. But to the extent that there was future opportunity beyond those top 30 markets and we thought the returns were going to be similar to what we've seen thus far, it will certainly be something we would be willing to look at and study and see if it makes sense for incremental investment.","On your second question, I really don't think the demand for the service has changed at all. I think it's much more an issue of our own focus and attention towards making sure we have the asset right for its long term intended use than what we think is the primary value driver.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson.","Nick Del Deo","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, Jay, again, on fiber solutions, would you argue that the prior 5% long-term target for growth you've laid out is still appropriate if we look beyond this year? I mean, you kind of said that you don't think current performance is indicative of its potential and demand hasn't changed. But you also kind of downplayed the growth outlook for non-wireless solutions, so it just wasn't clear to me how that all shook out.","Jay Brown","Sure, Nick. I think what I would tell you is, it may come back to a level of 5% at some point in the future, but we're not willing to predict that as the outcome. Our focus in the business around small cells is the long-term driver of the business and we think that's the most appropriate place for us to spend our time talking about the long-term prospects of the business.","As much revenue as we can get from fiber solutions that obviously makes sense to do so, because it adds the returns around the fiber. But we're trying to be really clear about what we think the long-term driver of the returns are and why we made the investments that we did.","As I look at where the business is performing relative to our underwriting assumptions, our underwriting assumptions we're tracking right on where our underwriting assumptions around these assets were. So I think publicly we had indicated that we thought we were going to be a little bit higher than even what our internal underwriting assumptions were.","But in terms of the focus and what we think the opportunity is, we're -- I would suggest that investors look at the business as we guided this morning to growth of about 3% in the business and if we're able to improve it from there, we'll certainly let you know once we've done it. And don't think it should impact how you think about the long-term returns around fiber.","Nick Del Deo","Okay. Got it. And then, yeah, on the small cell front are there reasons to think that municipalities and power companies are going to spend the money to staff up so they can work through small cells request at a pace consistent with demand? And to the extent that your overhead cost might not be aligned with the lower installation rates you're forecasting are there any opportunities to trim those costs?","Jay Brown","Well, one of the great benefits of the FCC order is that it requires the municipalities and the utilities to timely respond and deal with these -- with both the permits and the process of applications for installing in the right-of-way. So -- and the mechanism around the fees that we paid for that reimbursed the municipalities and the utilities for the reasonable cost associated with managing that activity regardless of the level of volume.","And so I think folks should read my comments as -- and they're intended to say the municipalities that are complying with the FCC order have done a great job of doing that and a number of markets that has helped the process, but there are still some municipalities and utilities out there that have been resistant to complying with the FCC order and I think we're in the process of both working through that with the local municipalities as well as working closely with the regulators to make sure that it's handled appropriately.","I wouldn't look beyond that towards kind of G&A or staffing or anything else as causes or reasons for it. I think the long-term outcome we're hopeful will be that this is somewhat temporary and that it ultimately you'll see municipalities and utilities fall in line with what the FCC order is and that will come back to a more normalized timeline around these activities. And if that happens we'll come back and update you on that. But based on what we're seeing currently I think the 24 -- the 18 months to 36 months is probably the right timeline.","Dan Schlanger","And Nick I think one of your questions was around our own overhead and whether the reduction going down to 10,000 node per year range would change that. I would just call your attention what we had before was 10,000 to 15,000 range, so we're on the low end of the range, but still within the range of what we thought was appropriate for the cost structure we have.","Of course to the extent that we can reduce our cost structure because there is lower activity or there are places we can get more efficient we will be looking to do so as aggressively as we possibly can. But I wouldn't expect that in the base case because this is within the range of outcomes that we were expecting for the year.","Nick Del Deo","All right. Understood. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question for Michael Rollins of Citi.","Michael Rollins","Hi, good morning. First, can you just give a little bit more context on the change in straight line within the 2019 guidance? And second can you give us an update on your outlook for discretionary capital spending with the changing outlook on small cell deployment and fiber revenue growth? Thank you.","Dan Schlanger","Sure. So, Mike as I mentioned before the change in straight line really is a combination of new leasing activity which causes new straight line and then the extension of current leases which also causes an extension of the term and therefore an increase in the straight-line revenue.","Both of those are related to increase tower activity. And as we've seen in the first couple or in the first quarter and the last quarter of 2018, those extensions and those amendment I note that new leasing activity has caused us to continue to increase the straight-line revenue because the activity levels are increasing more than what we had anticipated. And so we are excited about that because I think it's just like Jay said about services as an indication of what's going on with the tower leasing overall.","On the discretionary CapEx, we think it will remain consistent with what we said before about $2 billion of CapEx in 2019 is our expectation and continues to be, on a net basis around $1.5billion.","And the reason for that is most of the capital that we spend comes well before we are putting in the node portion of the small cell builds, and so we're continuing to have to do that and continuing to do that work now even though some of the time frame has been elongated a lot of that has been on the back end. So we anticipate making progress on the projects at the pace that we were anticipating and expecting from a capital perspective for 2019 as we were on our prior outlook.","Michael Rollins","Thanks very much.","Jay Brown","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Batya Levi of UBS.","Batya Levi","Great. Thank you. On the fiber solution side, can you provide a rough split of the $150 million incremental revenues you expect this year in terms of wireless driven versus enterprise driven?","And second question on the guidance. Can you remind us what it includes for Sprint activity this year?","Dan Schlanger","Yeah. On the first point of $150 million that part is on the fiber business itself and so all of that $150 million is related to our fiber solutions business not wireless customers.","Batya Levi","Right. In terms of the fiber backhaul for wireless nodes as opposed to pure enterprise business, if you split it that way.","Dan Schlanger","Yeah. We don't split it that way and largely because a lot of that business is a similar business, although I would say that within that fiber business the majority of it is enterprise, a vast majority for it is enterprise and not in the wireless backhaul. What we've said in the past is about -- to give you a little bit more color is about 50% of that business is generally with enterprise customers and 50% is with the carriers as we would call it or larger customers that have more backbone type of needs than what I think that you're trying to get to is enterprise versus that backbone is about 50\/50.","Batya Levi","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Jay Brown","Batya on your second question around Sprint, we don\u2019t comment on specific customer, so their activities -- so we'll let them speak with themselves in terms of what they're expecting to do with their network.","Batya Levi","Okay. Thank you.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Operator","Thank You. We\u2019ll take our next question from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick","Hi. Beating this fiber bookings a little more recognizing the fiber still hitting your underwriting goals, are there are regions or verticals that aren't really holding up in the bookings side? Or I wonder if you become more wary of the contract or revenue mix in fiber.","Jay Brown","Well, I think so what I would say is there's opportunity there. We haven't really seen the market change, which I was trying to make point to just a minute ago. What we went into this process of making these fiber acquisitions over the last several years, the way we underwrote the investment and thought about the opportunity was driven from our macro view of the need for small cells and what that would portend over time.","Obviously given the way fiber had historically been utilized, it was built originally solely for the use of in many cases the enterprise and fiber solutions revenue that you're asking about. So that's a relatively new business to us. There wasn't the driver, for which we underwrote. So if I were to go back and look at kind of our underwriting assumptions, and try to match those to your questions around, which components are doing better or worse than what we initially expected, that's probably a level of granularity and focus that frankly we just \u2013 we didn't aim towards that one when we were going to the process. We were focused much more on a range of outcomes around what we thought was going to happen in the wireless business.","And as I referenced in my comments earlier, the environment for that today is more robust and healthier than the environment in which we underwrote the fiber, the fiber investments initially \u2013 with regards to small cells. So I'm not trying to sidestep your question other than to honestly tell you that that's really frankly not where we spend a lot of time trying to analyze, and so trying to make the comparison. I don't know that there's much of a comparison to be made there.","Philip Cusick","I think and the reason that we are \u2013 I was just going to say that \u2013 I think the reason we're spending so much time on it is not because again the fiber into small cell opportunity is not a good one, but I think a lot of us have been maybe concerned that as you bought a lot of fiber revenue that was existing that you may over time not \u2013 not that size that as much and that the growth there may end up dragging you more than sort of the mid-single-digit that had originally been. So this is some of us are concerned that this is the first step of sort of deemphasizing that revenue growth that may drag the top line for a while.","Jay Brown","Well, I think it's fair to ask the question and to wonder about what the long-term prospect is going to be. And as I said in the same way that we would think about on towers, obviously we want to drive revenues outside of just a big four wireless operators, if all of the activity which makes up about 15% from non-wireless carriers on towers was to dry up that would impact our growth rate on towers and the same thing is true around fiber solutions.","So I don't need to \u2013 I don't mean to dismiss the question is irrelevant. It's not just the primary focus of the investments that we made, and therefore it has a lesser focus in terms of the way we think about operating the asset. While at the same time believing that every dollar that we get there is beneficial to ultimately the returns around fiber and therefore, it does warrant the appropriate level of attention and focus to make sure, we're maximizing the opportunity there.","Philip Cusick","Understood. If I can, one more quick one. Given the restrictions are coming from the sort of the approval side is 10,000 small cells a year a good guide going forward? Or do you see any shift that municipalities be able to prove these more quickly in the future?","Jay Brown","I think it's a good guide in terms of how you think about our model over the next couple of years with the bookings that we have and backlog currently. So I would guide you towards the 10,000 number in the short term. Longer term, the reason why the FCC order was put in place, was to facilitate the deployment of 5G in the United States. And our belief in terms of the macro opportunities around small cells is far greater than what's happening currently. And I think you're going to see the overall pie associated market sizing of the need for small cells to grow pretty significantly over the coming years as networks transition from 4G to 5G.","And so municipalities and utilities are going to have to figure out a way to use the benefit of the FCC order, which provides for the cost associated with scaling this up. They're going to have to get to the place where they facilitate that in order for the U.S. market to stay competitive and for the deployment of 5G. And I suspect they will. Obviously, the FCC has been responsive and has been really thoughtful in terms of the way they've drafted the order. And in the places I should at least tip my hat to the places that have complied with the FCC order, it has really helped. It's helped in terms of the deployment of small cells and you could see in our own activity deploying 10,000 small cells thereabouts in 2019, that's about 30% higher than what we were able to do last year. Some of that is a direct result of some of these municipalities and utilities that are complying with the FCC order, which we find to be really encouraging. So I suspect over time we'll see broader embrace of that and compliance with it and I think that would be helpful.","Philip Cusick","Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. ","Tim Horan","Thanks, guys. Jay, is there any thinking or talks with the municipalities that have more shared fiber infrastructure? Because, I mean, digging up these roads kills the structural integrity and getting power is very difficult and putting cell sites on the street lamps and everything else out there. Are you having any of those kind of conversations? Because one of the reasons Verizon is also building out really aggressively, just thinking about these roads time after time again just doesn't make any sense.","Jay Brown","Sure. That's certainly one of the areas that we look for is, is there existing conduit that can be used to pull fiber through or other opportunities or ways to do it with minimal -- as minimal an impact as possible inside of these municipalities. And ultimately, the municipalities and the utilities, we are working hard to be good partners with them and figure out ways to reduce the amount of impact in the community.","As you look at small cells across the country and go market-by-market, the types of poles that we deploy them on, the type of structure that we deploy, where we put the cabinets, the sizing of the cabinets, the sizing of the antennas and other things, is often tailored to the esthetic desires of the local municipality. And so, a component of it is esthetic that we're working with them on.","Another component or some of the things that you're referring to is are there ways for us to deploy this kind of infrastructure and minimize the amount of impact in the community. We're incented to do that, because it lowers our cost when that's available. So to the extent that there are ways to do that, we're certainly looking for ways to be smarter and faster about how we're both spending the time and investing the capital.","Dan Schlanger","And the other thing, Tim, that I would point out is, the core to our business is shared infrastructure. And we believe we are in the best position to put infrastructure in one and share it across as many customers as we can. As Jay was pointing out, with the focus on small cells, we can reach multiple of the wireless customers, but also with a focus on providing fiber solutions, we can add customers that same fiber infrastructure.","And we think we're in the best position of any company to do that. And if the municipalities really are focused on trying to limit the times that a street is dug up, they're allowing a third-party provider who can share that asset as many times as possible to be the provider of that asset, is likely the best outcome for everybody involved.","Tim Horan","No, you're preaching to the quire on that. I guess the question is that the cities really recognize that and have any cities implemented a policy like that other than like New York City with Empire City Subway?","Jay Brown","I don't know that I would put it in adopted a policy, but do we work with municipalities to do that, absolutely. And there are occasions where we found ways to do that.","Tim Horan","Well, I guess, lastly in this regard. I mean, Verizon says they're building out aggressively, they want owner\u2019s economics, its key to their 5G strategy. Do you try to coordinate with them and not build in the areas that they're going to vice versa? Yeah. And any thoughts on that would be great.","Jay Brown","Well, as I mentioned earlier in my comments about half of the overall activity that's happening in the market we think we're accomplishing and the other half is largely being accomplished through self-perform by the wireless operators.","Similar to the tower business, we don't see people overbilled assets so once an asset is there, those fastest and lowest-cost means by which to deploy infrastructure like small cells is to use the existing assets and that's the way we're seeing the business develop I think we would continue to that way.","I certainly don't expect that we're not going to build all of the miles of fiber that are going to be required in the U.S. for the deployment of 5G and small cells. There's going to be a number of players in this space including the wireless carriers who are going to build significant amounts of fiber and probably share that among themselves at some point.","Tim Horan","I guess what I was asking that 50% is that hopefully occurring in locations where you're not building is like where you building you get 100% of the small cells?","Jay Brown","Right. I mean what I would point to is again back to kind of the tower example, as infrastructure is in the market and there is opportunity there, existing infrastructure is preferred over trying to build the new infrastructure on top of the existing infrastructure.","This is very early days of what's going to need to be billed for small cells across the country. And so I think you can see the flow of capital to areas that are not currently covered and therefore the investment to build new fiber build areas that don't have any existing fiber, whether that's fiber that we built or somebody else built.","Tim Horan","Thank you.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our last question from Spencer Kurn of New Street Research.","Spencer Kurn","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe just to ask a question on the tower side. Can you just provide a little bit more color around your updated guide for new leasing activity on towers? You're targeting $140 million at the midpoint today. Could you shed some color on how that paces throughout the year? Just trying to understand if guidance implies similar level of growth as the second quarter or if you're expecting a further acceleration in the back half of the year.","Jay Brown","Yes Spencer on the revenue guide, we are expecting more activity in the second half than what we saw in the first half, so there's an acceleration in the back half of the year. I think that's somewhat similar to what historically we've seen where in our business the back half of the year tends to be more loaded than the front half. So, we are expecting an acceleration relative to the first half of the year and the second half.","Spencer Kurn","Thanks. And then just one follow-up on the comment you made in your prepared remarks. You talked about 4G activity and 5G activity driving a strong tower growth -- strong growth on towers over the next couple of years. Could you just elaborate on how you see 5G playing out on towers versus small cells? I love to get your thoughts on that. Thank you.","Jay Brown","Sure. I think what we will see is a combination of two things running parallel. First is the build out upgrading our network they will attend as they have done in past migrations of technologies to go to the places where they already have existing technology to upgrade equipment to the new technology. So, I would suspect we'll see significant amendment activity at sites where they go out and deploy additional attendance in line and amend existing equipment to make it 5G ready.","I think we'll also see in places where the carriers have additional spectrum that they have acquired where they will put what would feel like to us as a new installations in order to deploy that equipment.","In addition to that, I think you're going to see some places running parallel with that in the initial stages is in-fill because of capacity constraints, which will flow towards investments in small cells. So the areas that we've already put fiber in the ground have fiber in dense urban areas where there's a high amount of traffic, I think is the 5G network starts to begin to be loaded I think you're going to see the carriers invest not only in upgrading their existing equipment, but also offloading some of that traffic on the small cells and those dense urban environment.","Just like we saw in 4G, where as macro sites reached capacity they offloaded some of that traffic on to small cells in order to improve the cost efficiency and effectiveness of the macro side. I think you're going to see a similar play out on the 5G side. So it will be a combination of investment around both the macro side as well as small cells.","Spencer Kurn","Great. Thanks so much.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. At this time\u2026","Jay Brown","We will take one more question.","Operator","We have one more question from Jon Atkin of RBC.","Jon Atkin","Thanks very much. So I don't know if I missed this earlier or not, but I just want to kind of make sure I get the kind of the broad contours. It sounds like the small cells growth that you're expecting going forward might be a little bit less capital intensive. I don't know if that\u2019s a fair read or not?","And then secondly on the M&A side in terms of tuck-in fiber acquisitions, can you maybe describe the landscape and what looks interesting or not interesting to you? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Sure. Good morning, Jon. Less capital intensive is -- that's certainly true with regards to the co-location activity. As we go over the long-term, we would expect that once there's a certain base of fiber that's been built \u2013 anchor built fiber as we get to the point where the flips from being anchor build new sites in essence being billed, we'll move towards a greater percentage of co-location and then, therefore, the capital intensity comes down as associated with that activity.","I think based on our macro view though Jon that may be several years away from the environment that we're in today. As I made my comments earlier around how the carriers are thinking about the deployment of small cells, I think there's a lot of work still to be done even in the top 10, top 30 markets in the U.S. and then we'll just have to see how it develops beyond there.","But as we get towards the point where co-location becomes the vast majority of the business similar for drawn analogies to the tower business, you go back and look at the 1999 to the 2003 time frame there was a significant amount of capital that had to be poured into build and acquire towers, and now we\u2019re at the place in the tower business where we're virtually all the capital is related to co-location that's very low capital intensity required to do that.","So I think the same thing will happen in small cells. I think we may \u2013 it may still be several years away when we get to that point where it's a vast majority of the activity is just solely co-location's.","On your second point around M&A. I've made this point now for probably 1.5 years or so, but we just don't see any opportunities for large scale acquisitions of the kind of fiber that we believe fits our strategic goal. We need dense, high capacity urban fiber in order for it to really fit the small cells opportunities that we believe lie ahead. And from what we've seen in the market, there maybe from time-to-time some tuck-in acquisitions in certain markets to cover a portion of that market. But we really just don't see a lot of opportunity to make acquisitions. So I would suspect that, to the extent that you see us allocating dollar towards investing in fiber. We're more likely to do so on a build basis than we are to do it from the acquisitions.","Jon Atkin","Thanks very much.","Jay Brown","You bet. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. Look forward to catching up with you next quarter.","Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Crown Castle International Q1 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Thursday, April 26, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Fiona McKone, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.","Fiona McKone","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us as we review our first quarter 2012 results.","With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will discuss throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements and information based on management's current expectations.

Tables reconciling such non-GAAP financial measures are available under the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay A. Brown","Thanks, Fiona, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our press release and as outlined on Slide 3, we had an excellent first quarter, exceeding the high end of our previously issued guidance for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. ","We completed the acquisition of assets from Wireless Capital Partners, which we refer to as WCP on January 31, and the acquisition of NextG Networks on April 10. And we are making good progress integrating these acquisitions. ","We believe these acquisitions and the other investments we made during the quarter will enhance long-term AFFO per share. ","The strong year-to-date results from our site rental business, together with continued strong results from network services and the completion of the acquisition of NextG and the WCP assets, allow us to increase our 2012 outlook for site rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA by approximately $108 million and $88 million, respectively. ","Further, we saw a 25% increase in leasing activity in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter last year with the 4 major carriers in the U.S. accounting for approximately 83% of the activity. ","Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to highlight a few things from our first quarter results. During the first quarter, we generated site rental revenue of $498 million, up 9% or $41 million from the first quarter of 2011. Approximately 6% of the growth came from new tenant additions, reflecting the increased leasing activity driven by the 4 major U.S. carriers upgrading their networks. The acquisition of the WCP assets contributed approximately 1% to the growth in site rental revenue. Growth from the existing base of business from contracted renewals and contracted escalators net of any churn contributed another approximately 1% to the growth in revenue. Further, we had approximately $5 million of nonrecurring items in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to $9 million in the first quarter of 2011. ","Site rental gross margin defined as site rental revenues less cost of operation was $375 million, up 11% from the first quarter of 2011, reflecting an incremental margin of 89%. Furthermore, our Services business performed very well, posting another record quarter with the contribution from services gross margin increasing year-over-year by 45%. ","Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2012 was $360 million, up 13% from the first quarter of 2011. ","As shown on Slide 5, AFFO was $198 million, up 13% from the first quarter of 2011 or $0.69 per share, also up 13% from the first quarter of 2011. ","As reflected on Slide 6, we significantly exceeded our previously issued outlook for the first quarter for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA due to outperformance in our core business and the benefit of the acquisition of WCP, which was not included in our outlook for the first quarter. ","We exceeded our first quarter adjusted EBITDA outlook by $22 million due to an increase in leasing activity in the base business of approximately $7 million, a $6 million contribution from the WCP assets, which was not in our original guidance issued on January 25, 2012. ","Approximately $5 million of nonrecurring items and the higher services margin contribution of approximately $4 million beyond that which we had included in our previously issued guidance. ","With respect to AFFO, the outperformance and adjusted EBITDA was offset by the additional interest expense we incurred on the debt we raised to pay for both of the acquisitions we closed this year. ","Turning to investments and liquidity. During the first quarter, as shown on Slide 7, we spent $182 million on acquisition, $180 million of which was to acquire the assets of WCP. The WCP portfolio includes approximately 2,300 ground lease related assets, including over 150 related to Crown Castle towers, with 80% of the cash flow from the assets generated from the big 4 wireless carriers. ","We also assumed approximately $320 million of debt associated with the WCP assets. ","Additionally, during the first quarter, we purchased approximately 700,000 of our common shares for $36 million. ","Since 2003, we have spent $2.7 billion to purchase approximately 101 million of our common shares and potential shares, equal to 1\/3 of the company's share at an average price of $27 per share. ","With regards to our capital expenditures during the first quarter, we've spent $65 million. These capital expenditures included $28 million in our land lease purchase program. ","As of today, we own or control for more than 20 years the land beneath towers representing approximately 77% of our growth margin. ","We continue to enjoy significant success with this program as evidenced by the fact that today 39% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own, up from less than 15% in January of 2007. ","Furthermore, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 32 years. ","We believe this activity has resulted in the most secure land position in the industry based on land ownership and final ground lease exploration. And we continue to believe this is an important long-term effort that provides a long-term benefit as it protects our margins and controls our largest operating expense. ","Of the remaining capital expenditures, we've spent $4 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $33 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures. The latter consisting of $26 million on existing sites and $7 million on the construction of new sites, including distributed antenna system deployment. ","Further, during the first quarter and in April 2012, we used $56 million of our cash to purchase $24 million of our 9% senior notes and $28 million of our 7 3\/4 senior secured notes. ","After the quarter end on April 10, 2012, we closed the NextG acquisition for $1 billion. ","We ended the first quarter of 2012 with total debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 5.9x and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense of approximately 3.2x. ","Turning to our second quarter and full year 2012 outlook as shown on Slide 8 and 9, we expect site rental revenue of between $509 million and $514 million and adjusted EBITDA of between $360 million and $365 million for the second quarter of 2012. ","The sequential growth in site rental revenue from the first quarter 2012 to the second quarter 2012 includes the benefit of approximately $21 million of additional site rental revenue from NextG and the WCP assets. ","As we noted last year, we expected our growth in site rental revenue during the second quarter to be offset by churn during the period, and this continues to be our expectation. ","Further, we expect minimal benefits from nonrecurring items in the second quarter. ","The cumulative impact of these items is in expected net sequential growth in site rental revenue of approximately $15 million from Q1 2012 to Q2 2012.  The sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA from Q1 2012 to Q2 2012 is muted by the aforementioned nonrecurring items in the first quarter and our expectation of approximately $4 million less of service margin than the first quarter and the normal expected increase in seasonal repairs and maintenance of approximately $2 million. ","As shown on Slide 9, our increased 2012 outlook suggests that annual site rental revenue growth of approximately 10%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% and AFFO growth of 13%. ","The $190 million of expected growth in site rental revenue from 2011 to 2012 is comprised of the following: approximately $100 million of the growth attributable to additional tenant equipment added to our sites, reflecting the strong leasing activity we have enjoyed since the beginning of the year; and approximately $90 million of site rental revenue from our acquisitions of NextG and the WCP assets. The $154 million of growth in adjusted EBITDA from 2011 to 2012 is comprised of approximately $50 million to $55 million of benefit from our acquisitions of NextG and the WCP assets and $100 million of growth in our base business, which is up from $57 million of the expected growth in our base business and the previous outlook that we'd provided. ","I'm delighted with the outperformance of our base business and our increased expectations for the balance of 2012. ","We expect AFFO growth of approximately 13% from 2012. This reflects our increased expectations for adjusted EBITDA, offset by the higher interest expense cost associated with the debt we incurred as a result of the acquisitions. ","We would expect to augment this AFFO growth through opportunistic investment of cash flow and activities such as share purchases, tower acquisitions, new site construction and land purchases. ","Consistent with our past practice, our outlook does not include the benefit from these expected investments. ","Even with our recent acquisitions of NextG and WCP assets, we expect to have significant cash to invest in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share growth. ","For the full year 2012, we expect to generate approximately $830 million of AFFO and invest approximately $325 million on capital expenditures related to purchases of land beneath our towers, the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites, particularly distributed antenna system. ","Ignoring our borrowing capacity, the portion of our AFFO after expected capital expenditures represent a little over $125 million per quarter of cash flow we could invest in activities related to our core business, including purchases of our shares and acquisitions. ","Consistent with our past practice, we are focused on investing our cash in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share. I believe this level of capital investment can add between 4% and 6% to our organic AFFO per share growth rate annually. ","In summary, we had an excellent first quarter as we continue to execute around our core business, and I'm excited about our prospects for growth and investments as I look forward to the remainder of 2012. ","And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Thanks, Jay, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning. We realized it's a very busy week in the market. ","As Jay just mentioned, we had an excellent first quarter, exceeding outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. And we're excited about our business as we look to the balance of 2012. For the first time since the late '90s, all of the major wireless carriers are engaged in major network upgrades simultaneously and we are enjoying unprecedented visibility in the future revenue growth as reflected in our increased guidance. ","These positive trends are reflected throughout our entire business, including organic site leasing activity, our distributed antenna system business, our network services activities and our Australian business. ","Leasing activity grew 25% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter last year. The big 4 U.S. carriers accounted for approximately 83% of the growth in the first quarter, and as you expect, amendments made up approximately 80% of their activity in the first quarter as they continue to focus on upgrading their networks. ","Further, I'm very encouraged by the application activity we are seeing in the business, which we expect would translate into revenue later in the year. Consistent with their public statements, we are seeing continued activity by Verizon and AT&T in upgrading their networks to LTE, Sprint's Network Vision related activity and the resumption of activity by T-Mobile. ","Additionally, we look forward to assisting T-Mobile in their announced plan to upgrade approximately 37,000 cell sites to LTE over the next 2 years. ","In addition to a strong quarter of site leasing, our U.S. network services business performed exceptionally well as you might expect. Service revenues were up 27% and service margins were up 46% compared to the same quarter last year. This success results from a diligent effort to capture more of the opportunities to assist customers in locating or upgrading installations on our sites. ","Further, we enjoyed meaningful growth in our Australian business as the carriers are actively upgrading their networks to accommodate capacity challenges brought on by expanded data services, just as we have seen in the U.S. ","Finally in the first quarter, we closed on the acquisition of the ground lease assets from WCP, and earlier this month, we closed on the NextG Networks acquisition, which positions us as the industry leader in distributed antenna systems or sometimes referred to as the small-cell site solution business and builds on the DAS success we have already enjoyed. ","As part of this acquisition, we're excited to have the NextG team joining Crown Castle, and believe we will benefit from their expertise going forward. The integration of both these acquisitions is on track and proceeding very well. I know it is early days with NextG, we are even more excited about the future prospects of our combined organizations as the market leader in this exciting new extension of our business. ","In fact, small-cell architecture received a lot of attention at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona earlier this year. Globally, there were over 50 operators that have committed to deploying small cells in the first quarter of this year. In the United States, operators are augmenting their traditional infrastructure with small-cell solutions to boost network capacity and operators are starting to see all these technologies as key parts heterogenous networks. ","Importantly for us, the benefit of the shared wireless infrastructure model we enjoy in towers is present in small-cell deployments, and we are excited about this new extension of our business. ","The combination of all these positive trends allows us to increase our 2012 outlook, which now suggests AFFO growth of approximately 13% for the year compared to last year. And as is our practice, we'd expect to further enhance this growth by disciplined discretionary investment of our cash flow in tower and DAS acquisitions, share purchases and land acquisitions, and had aspirations that these investments combined with our organic growth can achieve AFFO per share growth rates in the mid to high teens as we've delivered in the past. ","Finally, before I turn the call over for questions, I would like to discuss some of the key trends we are seeing in mobile Internet demand. Cited in recent reports by Cisco, which validate the growth we're seeing from carriers as they continue to invest in their networks to meet the onslaught of demand, the mobile Internet. ","According to Cisco's latest forecast, global mobile data traffic grew a 2.3-fold in 2011, more than doubling for the fourth year in a row. And the expectation is that mobile data traffic will double again in 2012, an amazing accomplishment off of an ever increasing base. ","The proliferation of high-end handsets, tablets and laptops on mobile networks is a generator of traffic because these devices offer the consumer content and applications not supported by previous generations of mobile devices. ","The evolving device mix and growth in usage of devices continued to drive growth in global mobile data traffic. In 2011, while smartphones still only represented 12% of global handsets in use, they accounted for 82% of total handset traffic. ","Further, the growth in usage per device is expected to outpace the growth in the number of devices by a wide margin, driven largely by increased connection speed and network capacity improvements. ","As the carriers prepare for LTE, it's interesting to note that while 4G connections represent less than 1% of mobile connections today, they already account for 6% of mobile data traffic. The impact of 4G connections on traffic is significant because 4G connections generate a disproportion amount of traffic. And in 2011, 4G connection already generated 28x more traffic than an average non-4G connection, giving you some sense of the challenges that carriers are facing as we migrate from 3G to 4G services. ","Cisco forecasts that by 2016, 4G will represent 6% of the connections, but 36% of total traffic. And a 4G connection should generate over 9x more traffic than a non-4G connection. ","Importantly for our business, the success of the global transition to the wireless Internet is concentrated in developed markets with the U.S. leading the way, having the largest 3G subscriber base in the world. To that end, as it pertains to the U.S., the statistics are even more compelling. In 2011, mobile data traffic grew 2.7-fold in the U.S., and Cisco estimates that mobile data traffic will grow 16-fold from 2011 to 2016, that's a compound annual growth rate of 74%. ","Adoption rates for smartphones continue to accelerate, generating 14x more data traffic per month than a basic handset, driving wireless data traffic and increased tower demand from carriers striving to maintain a suitable level of network quality and reliability. ","The number of smartphones in the U.S. grew by 59% in 2011, reaching 128 million, and is expected to double again by 2016. ","Further, smartphones accounted for 24% of the mobile traffic in the U.S. at the end of 2011, are expected to account for over 60% by 2016. ","These impressive growth statistics and the attendant required network investment are why we are excited about the U.S. market. It is the largest and fastest-growing wireless market in the world. ","In order to keep pace with this anticipated growth, we see wireless carriers continuing to invest in networks by adding capacity to existing sites, splitting cell sites and utilizing small cell such as DAS where traditional macro site is not feasible. ","To that end, I believe our tower portfolio and our ability to execute for customers best positions us to capture this anticipated activity in the form of site leasing revenue growth as carriers continue to upgrade and add sites to meet this increasing consumer demand for wireless Internet. ","Having the right assets in the right locations is critical to meeting the demands of carriers today as they are working to add network capacity. We have the best located towers in the industry with 71% of our towers in the top 100 BTA, and we are now the largest provider of small-cell solutions. ","And as indicated by our quarterly surveys of customers, we continue to deliver the highest level of customer service in the industry, something we are very proud of. This is further enhanced, evidenced by our success in growing the network services portion of our business. ","To wrap it up, today, I'm excited on many fronts. Data growth in the U.S. market and the prospects for profitable investment by carriers and network enhancements to support this growth. Our position and focus on monetizing this opportunity through leadership in the U.S. market and the opportunities I see to invest in our core business to augment the strong organic growth we are seeing is very exciting. As we've said in the past, our focus is on maximizing long-term AFFO per share through opportunistic investments which is going to include acquisitions, share purchases and land purchases as we've done in the past. ","Finally, I want to say thank you to our employees for their hard work. As the volume of new business and network services opportunities and company are reaching unprecedented levels, and on top of that, we're in the midst of integrating these 2 new businesses we recently acquired. ","It's an exciting and busy time here at Crown Castle, and I'd also like to welcome our new employees from NextG listening to this call. ","With that, operator, I would be happy to turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator",".","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just maybe a question on the second quarter guide, first of all. You talked about it being up $15 million. I think the deals contribute $21 million and then you're hurt by nonrecurrence of the $5 million onetimer. So I guess, on a net basis, you're assuming the potential for a slight decline in site rental revenues. I know you've talked before about churn and sort of pegged it to Alltel. Can you just give us a sense as to what you're expecting that churn to be and maybe what the base business is actually doing? So is that still moving up and Alltel churn is just a decent amount so we get to the net number that's relatively flat or slightly down. And then second question, I guess, is just on taxes between NextG NOLs and then you talked, I think in the release, about some valuation reversals in 2Q that impact taxes. Does any of this move the needle on the NOL balance sort of in total and hence, influence the retiming in your mind?","Jay A. Brown","Great. On your first question, we had originally, when we put out the outlook for the first quarter and the second quarter of 2012, that back in January of this year, we had assumed both in the first quarter and in the second quarter that the churn that was scheduled, a portion of which was related to Alltel, would offset the normal escalations that we were seeing in the business. And for the first quarter, we did a little better than that, a little better than expected. In the second quarter, we stuck with the original assumption and we'll just kind have to see how it plays out. So we made a lot of comments here about the leasing activity on -- if you could just look at the stray number, think about it as newly originated site rental revenue in the period, that amount of activity where we're seeing new tenancy, they go on the towers that were not previously on those towers or tenants adding additional equipment to the sites they're already on. That activity in total is up about 25% from the first quarter of last year and it's early days of the second quarter, but we're in and around that range. So I think the trajectory of the guidance, as you look at the balance of the year, we're certainly picking up in the third and fourth quarter as we move past kind of the first and second quarter amount of churn that we had. We'll kind of see how it plays out in the balance of the quarter. Does that answer your question?","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jay, is there any way you can quantify the Alltel churn? You actually did see it in 1Q. I know you said it was later than expected, but any dollar amount you pin to it?","Jay A. Brown","We don't like to get specific about individual customers. So it wasn't Alltel. We called it out the last time we gave outlook just to give you some flavor of what was happening, but I'd rather not go all the way to that level of detail. The second question you asked around taxes, none of the acquisitions, either WCP or NextG, have any significant impact to our timing of NOLs, so we continue to believe that we'll exhaust the current NOLs in late 2015, beginning of 2015. And as we've talked about in past quarters and on past calls, we're sort of planning, if you will, to think about reconversion no later than the beginning of 2016, which would enable us to avoid corporate taxes to a large extent. So no change there on any of the adjustments that we've made related to these acquisitions or our forecast related to those acquisitions.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital.","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Conceptually, are you seeing any change in, call it, the ratio of usage per square meter and data from, say, dense urban versus rural? In other words, clearly, to a degree, the rising data tide list -- lists all boats. But are you seeing the mix shift, where it's listing, let's say DAS on a relative basis more than, say, traditional macro towers or the other way around?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I think, James, just in general, we're seeing continued capacity constraints being evidenced in these networks, and increasingly, those are happening in areas where it's difficult to solve the problem with macro tower sites or rooftop sites, hence, the need for some of the small-cell sites that we've talked about and our strategic direction with the acquisition of NextG. I think you're going to expect that to continue going forward as all of us as are consuming a lot more bandwidth and the spectrum is a relative finite resource, and so the size of these ultimate cell sites continue to shrink. I think it's important to note, as we're now in both businesses in a big way, we continue to see the small-cell site opportunity as very robust, but complementary to the macro site business. Clearly, a macro site where that's a viable alternative is the preferred approach, and that's a business that we're -- in our tower business, we're obviously still focused on in a huge way. So the way we think about the small cells and the DAS opportunity is to literally augment with a very same business model. I think this is really important. The very same business model in terms of a shared common element instead of it being the tower, being the fiber typically here where we can share it among a number of providers in the market and make it very efficient for them to access our systems. So that's really what we see, and I think time will play out. It's still very early days in this evolution of these sites and how the networks develop, but we see a long runway.","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And can you just -- also just help us think through what the impact of Verizon selling 700 megahertz spectrum, say, B-block spectrum to an AT&T would be in terms of the relative impact on you of, say, Verizon deploying that spectrum versus AT&T or another carrier?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I think that's putting a pretty fine point on kind of what our expectations would be. I think, typically, we see carriers working very hard to accommodate the demand that we're all placing as consumers on the networks, and how carriers ultimately elect to allocate spectrum and acquire spectrum is something we don't spend a lot of time on with them. I think it is interesting though to just consider the fact that the spectrum they're acquiring is of higher band than what they're selling, which certainly suggests given the penetration and the propagation characteristics of the spectrum that small cells or smaller cells are certainly going to play a role going forward where you don't necessarily need the propagation characteristics of the 700 megahertz spectrum because the cell site size that you're trying to accommodate here will certainly be accommodated with a higher frequency. So we thought that was sort of interesting in the observation. But beyond that, I really wouldn't have a comment for you.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sprint has been talking about how they're moving along with the Nextel turndown a little faster than they had anticipated. Could you just remind us how you restructured your relationship with them, so we understand the extent to which it matters? Or does it matter? How quickly they go ahead with that? And then secondly, T-Mobile keeps talking about maybe selling their towers. Presumably, all the major operators would look at it if it was on the market. You've always viewed the -- what do you need to believe approach to doing these deals? A lot of people think that T-Mobile might end up putting its -- itself up for sale at this point after they do this. What do you need to believe in order to buy a portfolio of towers from a carrier that might be a takeout target themselves?","Jay A. Brown","Okay, great. Brett, on the first question with regards to Sprint and their turndown of the iDEN network, which they'd indicated they can do. Again, the bookend of the exposure we have their, we think that's about 2% to 3% of consolidated revenues if they were to turn down all of those sites. We entered into an agreement with Sprint, which we publically talked about at the end of last year and that agreement provided them the ability to take down those sites under the timeline that they had originally announced, which would basically turn down the network in about 2014, which is commensurate with the average term they have remaining on those iDEN leases. So I would say if you're trying to factor it in and you want to take all of that out, take the wide end of it out, assuming that 2013, 2014 timeframe that we see a turndown of about 3% of consolidated revenues associated with iDEN. And right now, that's the best view that I have for you. And then we'll just kind of go from there.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Brett, I'll take the second one with respect to a potential tower process that maybe going on with T-Mobile sites. Look, as we always do, we look at anything available in the market and we always underwrite transactions like that with a heavy view towards reinvesting those proceeds or that capital in our own business in the form of share purchases. And so we would look at a relatively immature tower portfolio and back into what do you have to believe about future leasing to drive higher AFFO per share than we could have otherwise driven with those same proceeds in our business over a sort of a medium-term horizon. Jay mentioned earlier in the question about our anticipated or expected conversion to a REIT, that's our working assumption. It becomes very simple around here then if you start thinking about what is the objective, and the objective is to maximize the perspective dividend post 2016. It's very simple. And so we believe that's how we'll be measured. We think that's the basis for the AFFO per share calculation that we're all undertaking today. And so anything we do, including the NextG acquisition we just closed, we expect will drive a higher dividend capacity in the company in 2016 than otherwise we could have done with the other alternatives presented to us at that time. So that's how we'll look at any acquisition and that's how we've done it in the past and you should assume that will continue.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And to just sort of summarize there. If you were to do a very large transaction that may be required an equity component, you would be willing to endure maybe a little near-term dilution around, say AFFO per share, so long as you had high confidence that by the time you are operating as a REIT, you would be clearly better off than you otherwise would have been even if there were some M&A risk in the portfolio you're buying?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure. In a theoretical, sort of academic answer, sure, absolutely. We don't draw any hard and fast lines about what we will or won't do, but I'm happy to share with you what our objective is, and that is to maximize the dividend capacity in a sort of a medium term when we think that's going to be so important.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You raised your guidance for the year and you talked about the big 4 spending, but can you just talk a little bit more about specifically Clearwire and T-Mobile who are both planning LTE builds, but really haven't started yet. Is that more of a 2013, 2014 revenue opportunity or is that -- have you baked some of that into your $100 million underlying improvement for this year? And specifically on T-Mobile, is this going to be a situation like Sprint where you need to negotiate a new MLA and where do you stand on that?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure. With respect to kind of current activity, we haven't booked -- baked any of that into our future guidance, into our outlook for the rest of the year. So there's nothing going on within those 2 carriers in the order of magnitude of sort of a brand new LTE overlay that would suggest we put it in the guidance today. We're still in the early front end of that. We are seeing nice activity out of T-Mobile in what I would call the sort of a normal resumption of network enhancements and roaming overbuilds and things that they're doing. So that's certainly nice to see. We are on the front end and I don't think have not really commenced the process around the LTE overlay that they've described publicly. And Simon, I'm probably not going to get into a lot of detail on what our terms or MLA terms or things would look at. There's certainly options around negotiating a new master agreement with them. There's certainly the option to just proceed on a site by site basis sort of business as usual. We've done both in the past and have been successful in both regard, so we'll see what best suits them as we go forward, but none of that is in the current guidance today.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions, if I could. First, the wireless carriers in the U.S. that have reported so far had kind of a light first quarter CapEx for wireless compared to where some of the equipment analysts' expectations were at. Can you talk a little bit about what you saw, you mentioned the 25% leasing applications, but have you seen any kind of pause or slowdown? And then also, talk to us maybe a little bit about your visibility that how your leasing would related to the CapEx spending cycle?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, I think what we're -- the short answer is no, we haven't seen any slowdown. In fact, to the contrary, our application volume is up. And when we give you the revenue, that 25%, that's a revenue comparison in terms of originated revenue. The volume of activity is actually up beyond that in terms of numbers of application. And so we see a very high level of engagement on the part of our customers. Again, we would be sort of the leading indicator if the application cycle takes sometimes 6 to 9 months to actually turn into revenue. And so as we look out to the back half of the year, we see a lot of activity turning into revenue. I really couldn't speak to the equipment flows in terms of availability of equipment, but that's just one component of a fairly long cycle time of doing the installations and the upgrades on the sites. And so we are well underway with really all 3, and most recently in most volume being Sprint through their Network Vision activity that they've described. It's very, very busy around Crown Castle right now.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That's good, thanks. On your full year guidance, you updated a time on what the deal or acquisition impacts were on revenue, site rental revenue and EBITDA. How about can you address what the impact might have been on AFFO and maybe lump in the financing costs just so we can get gauge how much acquisitions plus financing?","Jay A. Brown","Sure, Rick. For the full year, the impact of the increased in interest expense is about $70 million. So you can net that off of the increase that we have in the acquisitions which is about $55 million or so. Remember there's a bit of a timing difference. We borrowed the money in January to prefund those acquisitions on a run rate basis. The acquisitions are basically a push at the AFFO line. So the growth in the base business is offset a little bit by the timing difference in when we began paying interest on the debt and when we closed on the acquisition, but the rest of the base business is -- or if you want to think about it as a run rate on the fourth quarter of this year, all of that growth in the base business falls through the AFFO line.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. And any unusual straight line items? I know you've given us the reconciliation there as far as old guidance versus new guidance, but was there anything unusual at either Wireless Capital Partners or with NextG coming up in next quarter's actuals?","Jay A. Brown","There's nothing related to those 2 acquisitions that should affect our straight line revenue in either WCP or in terms of NextG. I think if you look at the change in straight line revenues from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, most of that movement is related to the timing of cash received. Obviously, this is one of the reasons why we're excited about focusing on FFO because it takes us down to the cash line and gets us out of some of the noise that we'll see from time to time up at the revenue and adjusted EBITDA line. But directionally, we think that, that component of the noncash revenue is headed downward and obviously, again, that's the benefit of focusing on AFFO.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. And one other quick question. You mentioned how you look at stock buybacks versus deals. You guys did a fairly noticeable amount of debt buyback both in the quarter end and April. If I could just learn about what you're seeing there. Was it to look at the leverage or what else?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. That's just opportunistic financing, frankly. If you look at 2 components of our balance sheet, the current coupon on the debt is wide of what the market would bear today if we were to go -- do a new issue. There's the 9% notes which are issued by the holding company and then there's the 7 3\/4 notes, that senior secured notes that are issued by one of our subsidiary. And both of those instruments I would expect, over time, that will go in and refinance and push into a longer data financing and lower the interest coupon. And so the 9% note has a call date in January of 2013, so I would look at that as just opportunistically using our balance sheet, our credit facility, our revolving credit facility which we'll do over time and then ultimately we'll turn that out into a longer dated financing as the market allows.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple, if I could. Jay, just -- if you could just kind of help me think through. If I take out the M&A impact from the forward 2012 guidance, the leftover is something like $18 million of increased revenue, but $35 million of EBITDA. If you could kind of just help us think about how we get that equation to balance between revenue and EBITDA? And then second, just a couple on the deployment side. One, have you gotten any sense that like someone like a DISH who's looking at build requirements coming through the NPRM that will come out for their terrestrial build is doing the ground work to get ready to do something possibly in the next year or so? And the flip side to that item shutdown question, Sprint shared that they had done about 600 cell sites in terms of their CDMA upgrade through the first quarter, but they had thousands and thousands that were about to start coming online. Could you kind of tell us how you -- how should we think about that build acceleration starting to kind of positively impact your growth through the rest of the year?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. I'll take the first and the third and let Ben take the second one. On the impact which we laid out and I think you've correctly discussed kind of the benefit of the base business, and the reason why EBITDA is maybe higher than revenue. Two reasons there. One is on the cost side, both site rental and direct cost and the benefit that managing G&A appropriately for the balance of the year, there is some benefit there. As we talked about with the NextG acquisition, we expect over time there'll be some synergy. So we're getting some benefit there. And then the second thing is from a services business contribution. From the services business, we obviously had a very good quarter in the first quarter and we slightly raised our expectation for the balance of future quarters based on the increased activity we're seeing in the site rental business. So I think that's most of that. And the third question around the guidance for the full year. This is -- as Ben talked about, this is something we haven't seen in a very, very long period of time where you have all of the major carriers working on significant deployments. And so as you think about AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile, all 4 of them are very active as they're either upgrading networks, deploying new cell sites but really enhancing their wireless networks, particularly as a result of all of the trends that Ben spoke about in the data space. And so over the course of the year, as we continue to roll here, we've seen activity across the board from all of the carriers and that's why leasing activity was ahead of our expectation. I hate to kind of zero in on any 1 of those 4 because I think the general trajectory of all of those 4 would appear to be higher than what we've seen in the past years for the balance of this year, and that's reflected in the changes that we made to our forward outlook as well as the benefit that we saw in the first quarter. And happy to give you maybe a little bit more clarity on how that plays out in the balance of the year, but right now the tail, it looks like a pretty strong tailwind for the balance of the year from all of us.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. And specifically Sprint, we see a lot of activity as you indicated, and that's certainly a factor in our outlook going forward. Your second question, David, will be short on DISH. We're in active dialogue with them. I won't certainly attempt to speak for them or what their plans are on this call, but we're very excited about the prospect of that spectrum ultimately coming to market in whatever form or partnership or structure that it may take. We have assets and portfolio, whether it be macro sites or small cells. We are absolutely available and willing to work with them very aggressively on helping them deploy that spectrum. And so it's exciting for us sort of at a high level that you have someone entertaining a business plan with a notion of wanting wireless service through a spectrum they've acquired. Beyond that, we'll have to wait and see exactly how the deployment plan looks.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you delve a little more into the services business? It was pretty nice beat this quarter. You said you did take it up a little bit, but what in particular is -- has been the source of the improvement? Do you feel like you're a little conservative now going forward or could that even ramp a little further?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes. The services -- thanks for asking because it's a lot of work and we got a lot of people deploying, working hard for customers on that effort, but we're continuing to increase our take rate in terms of opportunities among carriers touching our sites and then increasing the scope of what we're actually doing in those individual installations. And won't get into a whole lot of detail there, but we've increased the scope of work that we're typically taking on for customers there. We are always, and I'm the first one on this topic, we're always conservative about how we anticipate or forecast future growth there. It's just difficult. It's volume based, it's transaction based and it's a discretionary purchase on the part of the carrier. So it's a very difficult thing for us to forecast. We are very pleased to see that its trajectory has been up and we've been doing very well with it. And frankly, the way we think about it is it covers a lot of overhead and a lot of the activities that we undertake to bring us closer to our customers in the high touch experience that they enjoy working with us, but we are going to always sort of take a little bit of a haircut on our forward outlook until we ultimately deliver and maybe that provides a little bit of an upward surprise from time to time, and that's a good thing. We've been on the reverse of that as well, as you remember. So we're going to try to keep it on the side.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you remind me, because I forget, is that more a construction driven or is it more permitting and amendments driven?","W. Benjamin Moreland","It's all of the above. It's everything from permitting and zoning all the way through the construction management cycle of the installations that were the amendments on our sites. It's really a turnkey process.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with Credit Suisse.","Jonathan Chaplin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two quick questions, if I may. First, just a basic housekeeping question. Can you remind me, I think Sprint told us that they've done the zoning and permitting on about 10,000 of the 12,000 sites that they hope to build this year. What point does it go into guidance for you guys? Is it once the zoning and permitting is complete? And then the second question, I think we've heard very supportive comments from 3 of the major carriers so far this quarter about a much bigger push into small-cell networks. What's a little bit unclear to me is in which situations they're building those networks from cells, certainly in the case of PCS. It sounded like that it was more of a build than using a third-party provider. How do carriers decide between when they build it themselves or when they use something like NextG's assets to make those deployments?","Jay A. Brown","Sure, Jonathan. On your first question, any of the carrier activity, we put it into the outlook or into the guidance when we have reasonable basis to do so. And that can either be based on the conversations we have with the carriers or alternatively when we have application. The applications give us about 3 to 6 months worth of visibility. And so as you're looking at any cycle early in the year now, we would have pretty good visibility as to what the second quarter and a portion of the third quarter would look like in terms of the applications coming online. The end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter activity would be largely based on conversation, and that's true regardless of which carrier customer you're talking about.","W. Benjamin Moreland","To your next question on the interest on the part of the carriers around DAS networks and small cells, here's how our experience has gone in terms of -- and we're gratified the see that basically we're involved in existing agreements and ongoing conversations with really all the major carriers at this point. And the decision to purchase decision that they make in our experience is most largely driven by speed and execution capability, which we are thrilled to death to tell you that in our judgment, NextG is the best in class at that. So in terms of getting networks on the air, on time and on budget, there's nobody better. The second area that I think is incredibly compelling is what I was speaking about in my opening remarks around the nature of the shared wireless infrastructure model that we promote and utilized in the tower business where the carriers are able to spread the cost of data occupancy among their tenants, their co-tenants on our towers. The same is true in a DAS system where it's going to be much more economically efficient for one party, in this case, ourselves, to own a system and share it among carriers in that market. We are in a -- we believe have adequate or superior return above our sort of cost to capital for the effort and the risk profile we're undertaking. But for each individual carrier, it's a significantly less expensive proposition to occupy our site or our system than it is to try to build themselves. I would say it's in that order that I suggested the first criteria, given the network challenges is speed and execution capability. But we always have an eye toward making sure that it's economically compelling for the customer so that we're always on the right side of that equation. And so far, we are very pleased with what we see.","Jonathan Chaplin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So when they do deploy their own systems, are they using them as multi-tenant systems and competing against your NextG assets, if they build it, it's exclusive.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Well, it's very early days, but there's certainly nothing preventing them from that. I think experience and just logic would tell you their primary objective is to satisfy their own capacity challenge on their own network. And to the extent co-location is an opportunity, you have to ask them, certainly, on a venue, in building situation, that's often the case. But there's a big market out there and we're certainly not going to be the only party in this business and we'll have a number of parties in the business as we have today, as well as our carrier customers self providing, building for themselves because, frankly, there's a lot of need out there and they can't always be met by the independent parties that are in the market.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you could help us think through for the NextG business? For the revenue and the EBITDA, how do we think about the revenue that comes from the long-term nature of the lease itself versus the accrual of revenue that's for the reimbursement of the capital spending that you're performing on behalf of the tenant and they're paying you upfront for that deployment of the equipment?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure Mike. Good question. This is a -- I would describe it as a venue-by-venue discussion depending on where the system is built. It's also a carrier by carrier conversation. And so depending on what the desire of the venue and the economics of how that relationship is structured, it can be structured as an upfront payment that's required to the venue in order to secure the system, for the rights to build the system in the area. Sometimes they would rather have a share of ongoing revenues. Sometimes they would like a fixed ongoing payment in the future, and that to some degree drives then the conversation that we have with the carriers when they are interested in going onto the systems. It is typically structured like the tower business, where most of the value is driven by ongoing revenues that are paid on the quarterly -- on a monthly basis over a long period of time. Some portion of those revenues, depending on -- largely dependent on how we think about the payments at the initial date to do that for capital deployment, considerations or payments to the venue, sometimes we'll ask them to pay a portion of their rent in the form of a prepaid rent that they pay day one. And so I wouldn't describe there to be a norm yet in this industry. My guess is after a couple of years, there will be something that becomes more normalized, but today, it's a transaction-by-transaction basis. And as we evaluate it, we're looking at it on a return standpoint. So as Ben described earlier in the conversation, how we evaluate alternatives, we can certainly talk about that on a broad basis around how we think about investments and buying back shares or tower acquisitions for DAS investments. When you get down to the more specific level, we would look at each individual transaction or opportunity that we may choose to bid on or not bid on based on the economics that we think are available there. And that would be a combination of what are the economics to the venue and then what are the economics we're receiving from the carrier, and then we balance those and strike a deal that we think delivers the appropriate return for the risk that we're taking.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And if you had to take a look at either the heritage tower portfolio you have versus the NextG, is there a different percentage of revenue that comes from this sort of noncash, I guess you call it CapEx reimbursement? So if you were to compare the 2, is that a meaningful difference in revenue contribution?","Jay A. Brown","Mike, we've owned the NextG assets for a couple of weeks, which is the majority of what we have in terms of DAS site. And those only have one and a quarter tenant on them. So I think that will probably be a question we'll be better able to answer over time as we structure more of these deals and negotiate with the carriers. But right now, it's such early days. I think, in general, if you were to look at kind of past practice and kind of where we're at today, the portion of prepaid rent that the carriers have been willing to pay broadly in the industry is maybe higher than traditional towers. But keep in mind a lot of that was driven by the fact that a lot of the folks in the business were funded by private equity and so they really didn't have an opportunity or an ability to have capital put to work on behalf of the carriers like we do. So my guess is that, over time, the migration will probably look more like the traditional tower business, but it's so early that it's really hard to say that. And again, this is driven on a deal by deal economics, and so I think we're looking at driving returns given a certain set of investment opportunities that are in front of us and maybe ultimately the carrier's view and desire is to go to a structure that looks more like paying a higher portion of the rent day one. And we'd be open to that structure. It just comes down to the economics and the returns around certain assets. But I think, honestly, you're going to have to give us a little bit more time and we'll kind of see how the market develops.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Whatever develops ultimately gets washed out at the AFFO line though, right, because that's ultimately just cash. So it's all about returns at the end of the day.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick couple of follow-ups. First, what were some of the onetime items that contributed to the $5 million help in the quarter? And also just a follow-up on the guidance, I think the deed in the first quarter was about $7 million better on the base business, but you shook out the acquisition benefits for the full year guidance, the raise is about $12 million, $13 million. The reason that the bps slows down, is that a function of the churn that you mentioned or is there any other items that takes it down? And last question, I believe you said that you expect some margin dilution on the services business in the second quarter. Can you talk about what would drive that?","Jay A. Brown","Sure. On the onetime items, there are things where we find, as we do normal reviews of the portfolio, we will find that the carrier has installed some equipment that maybe we weren't notified about and so there will be some nonrecurring benefit that we'll pick up revenue from the last time that we ought to visit the site and they pay us for that. Some of it is just timing around when leases get into the system against when they were installed on the site. So there's always going to be a little bit of that noise. It's a little higher this quarter, honestly, than what it normally is. Normally, we're in the kind of 2 to 3 range and up at 5 in the first quarter. So a little higher than the normal, but not completely unusual. The impact for the balance of the year, I mean, I spoke to the question earlier around how much visibility we have. We certainly had a very good first quarter. We have pretty good visibility based on applications for about 3 to 6 months. And for the last half of the year, we're just doing it based on either conversations we've had directly with the carriers or what they've said publicly, and we've maybe mitigated a little bit from current levels of activity in the back half of the year and the outlook we gave and we'll just kind of see how it develops. And then in your last question around how the services business performs and why we're assuming that it's down. As Ben spoke to, there's a lot of volatility there and we don't have as much visibility or clarity on exactly the services that the carriers will engage -- gauge us to do. So we're generally pretty conservative in terms of the outlook that we give. If you were looking at it in past periods and you were to look at changes either up or down, that's largely indicative of the movements in the carrier's leasing activity and how much deployments they have going on. So in periods where the carriers are deploying more equipment, they're busier when they offload more of that work to us. Where there's not as much activity going on, those would be reflected in slowdowns in that business. That's the generalization. But as we give outlook, we're generally pretty conservative against that. So sometimes, there's a bit of a divergence between what we talked about in terms of lease applications and that environment and then what we baked into our outlook for our services business.","W. Benjamin Moreland","All right. Thanks. I think with that, we're right at the bottom of the hour. I know it's a busy time, so we'll let everybody jump. Thanks for joining us on the call. We've got a lot going on, look forward to the rest of the year and some exciting things happening at Crown Castle. So have a great rest of the day.

With me on the call this morning are Jay Brown, Crown Castle\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we\u2019ll refer to throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors sections of the company\u2019s SEC filings. Our statements are made as of today, April 18, 2019, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","In addition, today\u2019s call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investors section of the company\u2019s website at crowncastle.com.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Brown","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another great quarter of financial results, reflecting the significant demand for our shared infrastructure assets and the terrific execution by our team. Given the positive momentum we continue to see in our towers and fiber results, we are investing in our business to generate future growth while delivering dividend per share growth of 7% to 8% per year. With our strategy and unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers and approximately 70,000 route miles of fiber concentrated in the top U.S. markets where we see the greatest potential demand growth, we believe we are uniquely positioned to translate growth in data demand into growth in cash flows and dividends per share.","As the volume of data delivered by both wireless and wired networks continues to grow, our customers are increasing the capacity of their networks by leasing additional access to our tower and fiber infrastructure assets, which in turn generates growth in our cash flows. As you can see in our 2019 outlook, this positive backdrop is resulting in higher levels of new leasing activity across all of our assets. On the tower side of the business, our customers are improving and densifying their networks by adding more equipment to existing leases and adding to new leases on our towers.","The higher levels of tower leasing we experienced in the back half of 2018 has continued into this year, affirming our expectation for an increase in tower leasing this year as compared to 2018. With regards to fiber and further highlighting the strong demand for our infrastructure, we expect to nearly double the number of small cells we deploy in 2019 after installing a record number of small cells last year. Our strategy has positioned us to take advantage of the increasing activity by our wireless customers as they respond to the continued growth in data.","To this end, we are excited about the significant investments we are making to build new fiber assets as we pursue this expanding small-cell opportunity. By focusing our investment in high-capacity fiber across the top markets where we see the greatest potential demand for small cells, we believe we are extending the potential long-term growth in cash flows and dividends per share. Our fiber strategy utilizes the same playbook we used with towers by sharing the asset across multiple customers. With our leading capabilities and fiber solutions, we have the ability to increase the yields on our fiber investments by growing cash flows from both small cells and fiber solution customers that require access to the same high-capacity, dense fiber asset in the top markets of the U.S.","By sharing a common asset across a larger customer base, we are able to provide each of our customers with cost-effective access to the critical infrastructure they need while generating significant value for our shareholders over time as we lease our assets and generate cash flows. Consistent with our expectations, we continue to see very attractive returns on small-cell investments with initial yields of 6% to 7% for the first tenant. And similar to towers, we are seeing demand for multiple tenants on the same asset, in this case fiber, resulting in high incremental margins that increase the returns above our cost of capital on the second tenant with additional upside as we add more tenants over time.","To date, we have invested approximately $13 billion of capital to establish fiber footprints in prime locations across the top U.S. markets where we see the greatest long-term demand. These investments are already yielding 8% and have significant available capacity to further increase the return as we add new small cell and fiber solutions customers. While those returns are great and justify the investment, I get even more excited when I consider how early we are in the digital transformation of the U.S. economy and in the critical role our infrastructure will play. The current demand environment is largely tied to our customers investing heavily in their 4G networks to keep pace with the 30% to 40% annual data demand growth from existing technologies while the investment in 5G is just getting started.","Recent commentary from the White House and FCC that they are committed to ensuring the U.S. wins the race to be the world\u2019s leader in providing 5G underscores our belief that the U.S. is the best market in the world for infrastructure ownership. We believe 5G has the potential to significantly increase the demand on communications networks by moving beyond simply connecting millions of people to potentially connecting billions of devices in the future. The size of the opportunity will likely attract significantly more investment in networks over time from both existing operators as well as potential new entrants that will require access to network infrastructure at scale.","While we continue to underwrite our investments to attract \u2013 to generate attractive shareholder returns based on existing applications and technologies, we believe the network infrastructure needed to support 5G will dramatically increase the demand for our tower and fiber assets over time. It is truly an exciting time in our industry. And in many ways, it reminds me of several other points in time over the past two decades as we are currently benefiting from the significant ongoing investment in today\u2019s networks while also looking forward with great anticipation of what lies ahead.","How exactly the investment in 5G ultimately transforms the way we live and work is yet to be determined. But if past is prologue, I suspect most are underestimating the magnitude of the change and the corresponding opportunity for us. With our unmatched asset base and expertise, I believe Crown Castle is in a great position to play an important role in the next chapter of this industry.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schlanger","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay discussed, we delivered another quarter of solid growth, and we remain excited about the positive long-term industry fundamentals that are creating significant demand for our unique portfolio of communications infrastructure.","Turning to Slide 4 of the presentation. You can see we had a great quarter with site rental revenues increasing 6%, adjusted EBITDA increasing 8% and AFFO increasing 9% when compared to the same period a year ago.","Turning to Page 5, we are maintaining our full year outlook for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. At the midpoint, the expected organic contribution to site rental revenues from 2018 to 2019 represents approximately 6% growth year-over-year compared to 5.6% for full year 2018. The higher expected growth this year is driven by higher levels of new leasing activity for both towers and small cells with consistent year-over-year contribution to growth from fiber solutions.","It\u2019s worth highlighting that historically speaking, the second quarter represents the low watermark with respect to quarterly AFFO during the year. This is primarily caused by certain seasonal expense items that tend to be higher in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, including cash taxes and repair and maintenance expenses, which impacts both sustaining capital expenditures and operating expenses.","From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to improve our financial flexibility. In February, we issued $1 billion of unsecured notes with 10 and 30-year maturities, utilizing the net proceeds to repay outstanding revolver borrowings. By taking advantage of favorable market conditions, we were able to proactively lock in attractive long-term interest rates and extend the weighted average maturity of our outstanding debt to approximately 6.5 years.","Additionally, following the close of the quarter, we established a $1 billion commercial paper program that we intend to use as a short-term funding source. This program provides a potentially lower cost option relative to our revolver while increasing our flexibility by tapping into another pool of capital. As we have previously stated, we intend to finance the business with approximately five turns of leverage longer-term, consistent with our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile.","So in closing, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we believe we remain well positioned to generate approximately 7% growth in AFFO per share in 2019. Looking further out, we are excited about the current investments we are making in new assets that we believe will extend the long-term opportunity to generate compelling returns for our shareholders with a combination of dividends and growth.","With that, Cody, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Thanks very much. Good morning. Turning to the small cells, you talked about the increased pacing in the small-cell build this year. Perhaps you could just get into a little bit more detail about where you are on that trajectory in the 10,000 to 15,000 range. And what specifically is happening to help you achieve that? And any more color you could provide on how the lease-up of the initial build is going? Thank you.","Jay Brown","Good morning, Simon. On your first question, we\u2019re on pace as we talked about to be able to put the number of small cells on air this year of about double what we did in 2018. That activity is ramping through the course of 2019, such that by the end of 2019, we think we\u2019ll put about double the number that we had in 2018 on air. It\u2019s going as expected. We had \u2013 obviously, this represents \u2013 given the time line to build these of 18 months to 24 months, this is the culmination of work that\u2019s been ongoing for some period of time, so we\u2019ve already built the organization to be able to handle that level of activity, and a lot of the activity required in order to get that many small cells on air has taken place in past periods. So we feel pretty good about where we are.","On the data points around what we\u2019re seeing with lease-up, consistent with what we\u2019ve been talking about over the last couple of years, we\u2019re continuing to see proof points in a number of different markets where we have acquired fiber from whether it\u2019s FiberNet or Lightower or other acquisitions that we\u2019ve done over time, we\u2019ve seen that fiber begin to lease-up for small cells. And then the assets that we have built, specifically for small cells, we\u2019ve continued to see lease-up on those assets that\u2019s in line with our expectation of being able to exceed our cost of capital with that second tenant and then continued upside as we share the asset across customers into the future.","As we\u2019ve talked about and I think this is reflective of our results, given the opportunities that we see in small cells to invest further capital, a significant portion of the activity that\u2019s ongoing for small cells is the continuation of building new assets or immature assets. We\u2019re putting those on air at somewhere in the neighborhood of about a 6% to 7% initial yield on invested capital. And given the opportunities and the data points that we\u2019ve seen that these assets are going to lease up over time when we build them in the best markets, we\u2019re continuing to expand and grow the pie.","So whether it\u2019s margin expansion or return on capital, we\u2019re basically constantly diluting the legacy mature portfolio \u2013 maturing portfolio with new assets that come in, in that 6% to 7% initial yield and lower margins than assets that have been on air for quite a period of time. And given the scale with which we\u2019re doing the new activity and expanding our footprint, that has a far more significant impact to our financial results, frankly, than the lease-up does.","Simon Flannery","And how do you think about expanding \u2013 you talked about best markets, but going beyond your existing markets to newer markets, is there any opportunity there?","Jay Brown","Well, the vast majority of the activity would be focused on the top 30 markets currently in the U.S. That\u2019s the focus of the wireless operator. So the vast majority of our capital is we\u2019re supporting them and building for them. It\u2019s really focused on those top 30 markets. Based on both their public comments and some activity that we\u2019ve seen, we think this is going to go well beyond the top 30 markets and be impactful to at least the top 100 markets.","And if the returns stay where \u2013 based on what we have seen in the top 30 markets, we\u2019re happy to continue to follow them in the markets beyond the top 30. But at this point, the vast majority of our capital investment would be focused in the top 30 markets, and that would go for both the nodes that we have on air as well as nodes that we have won and are under contract and we\u2019re in the process of beginning to build that will come on air over the next couple of years.","Simon Flannery","Great, thanks so much.","Dan Schlanger","Yes. Simon, it\u2019s Dan. Just to follow up a little bit on that. Jay said if the returns are there, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the other markets as we continue to push out small cells and our customers do. But as we\u2019ve said for a while now, we don\u2019t see a huge opportunity for acquisitions to help us down that path. We think most of that will be organic type of build in those markets. We may see some tuck-in acquisitions, but the majority of what we see is the new build will be through spending our own capital and building out new assets.","Simon Flannery","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Barden, Bank of America.","Joshua Frantz","Hey guys, it\u2019s Josh in for Dave. Thanks for taking the question. Just a few, if I could. Can you break down the growth in the quarter within fiber solutions and the small cell part of the fiber segment and maybe any drivers there and then the growth you\u2019re expecting within those pieces for the year? And then is there any seasonality within small cells when you can actually put nodes up winter over summer, something like that, that we should be aware of? Thanks.","Dan Schlanger","So taking that first question \u2013 Josh, thanks. The breakdown of revenue in the quarter is similar to what it has been historically between fiber and small cells at about 75% fiber and 25% small cells. Importantly, though, as we look out over the course of 2019, consistent with keeping our guidance very similar, where we are is \u2013 where we were before is that the growth in small cells we anticipate to be between $70 million and $80 million in new leasing activity. And on the fiber side, it\u2019ll be between $160 million and $17 million, which is consistent with what we said previously.","So we see the growth rates be very similar to what we have been expecting. With respect to seasonality, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s really seasonable \u2013 seasonal about deploying small cells. It really comes down to when we can get everything through the municipality\u2019s permitted zones and then constructed. And that, as Jay pointed out earlier, takes 18 months to 24 months on average. But that can range beyond 18 on the low end and beyond 24 on the high end, so it really just depends on when all of that gets done when small-cell nodes get put on air.","Joshua Frantz","Thanks. Is there any drivers in the fiber solutions side that you could call out in terms of growth in the quarter specifically?","Jay Brown","No. I think as Dan mentioned, as we look at the calendar year 2019, we have the same expectation for how the year will play out as we did previously. And I wouldn\u2019t point to anything seasonal in that business.","Joshua Frantz","Got it, thanks. Thanks for taking the questions.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Dan Schlanger","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now move on to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","Thanks. So we look at full year guidance, you obviously implying that there\u2019ll be acceleration. You had 5.7% organic contributions to growth this quarter, and I believe the midpoint on average for the year is at 6%. I\u2019m just curious as we think about what drives the acceleration, I would guess it was probably ramped in small cells. But if there\u2019s more nuance, color you can provide on that, that would be very helpful.","Jay Brown","Well, I think we\u2019ve got acceleration happening across the business, Brett. If you look at our numbers, as Dan just mentioned, year-over-year, we\u2019re expecting about $15 million more of new leasing activity on towers as compared to 2018. And on the small cell side, there\u2019s about $20 million more, so that\u2019s impacting the fiber segment. Year-over-year, the growth numbers on fiber solutions are masked a bit by the acquisition activity, but there\u2019s meaningful more revenue from fiber solutions in calendar year 2019 compared to 2018.","But I wouldn\u2019t point to necessarily another acceleration beyond what we\u2019ve talked about here. As we look at the full year, it\u2019s up meaningfully from 2018 towards the elevated end of what we saw at the end of 2018, in fourth quarter results, and we\u2019re seeing that kind of activity continue into 2019. We do think \u2013 as I made the point in my comments, we don\u2019t think this is a short-term change in the activity given what\u2019s happening in the landscape and the focus of the carriers of continuing to deploy for 4G given the growth they\u2019re seeing in data networks. We think we\u2019re in a period of time where we\u2019re going to see some sustained and be elevated levels of tower leasing activity and drive towards small cells. And then the long-term aspects of that, we think, is at least extending the runway of growth in the business as the next leg of technologies and opportunities are on the horizon.","Brett Feldman","Got it. If I could just follow-up on something that you were talking about earlier. I think you had said that the small-cell deployments you had targeted for this year was in scope of what you were logistically capable of doing. And I\u2019m curious, do you think you\u2019re sort of at a run rate in terms of level of small-cell deployments just because that means you\u2019re finally getting some operating leverage in business if you\u2019re not scaling up your G&A anymore?","Jay Brown","Yes. I think if the level of activity were to stay similar to what we\u2019re going to undertake in 2019, then yes, we\u2019ve scaled the organization to be able to do that, and we\u2019ll see the benefit of operating leverage there. As I would think about operating leverage, the vast majority of margin expansion in our business \u2013 you can look at the tower model and see the same dynamic. The vast majority of the expansion of margin happens as we have a stable asset base and then we add tenants to that stable asset base over time, and then you see a really steady growth in margins.","In the case of small cells, given the amount of activity that\u2019s really related to expanding the portfolio, even though there are components of the portfolio from years ago that we had built, that\u2019s relatively small compared to the amount of new activity that\u2019s coming on where we\u2019re building new markets. And therefore, the margin expansion or the leveraging of the cost structure, in essence the asset base, you don\u2019t see that reflected in the margins as quickly as what you do or as directly as what you do on the tower side.","We\u2019re seeing it in pockets as we look for data points to test our assumptions, to see whether or not the business is developing as we would expect. But I think we\u2019re going to continue to see margins \u2013 it won\u2019t expand as quickly on the fiber side as we continue to put \u2013 as I\u2019ve discussed earlier in the call, continue to put immature assets into the mix. Those new assets have lots of growth potential. But initially, they basically dilute the margins down.","Brett Feldman","Got it, thank you.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now move on to our next question from Jon Atkin with RBC.","Jon Atkin","Thanks. So real quick on MLAs, I wondered if you could maybe just sort of review for us of your MLAs that kind of encompass macro towers, how many are holistic arrangements where your revenue growth is mostly fixed irrespective of tenant activity level versus framework agreements where your revenue growth kind of flexes in relation to leasing activity? And then maybe in addition on the MLA topic, how many include small cells as a component of that? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Yes. Jon, on the first part of your question, we \u2013 as you know, we are very hesitant to talk about the kinds of contracts that we sign with customers and who those customers are. So I\u2019m going to kind of \u2013 I\u2019ll beg off of your question, I think, in terms of the specificity with which you\u2019re asking it. I think as you look at our leasing activity, though, more broadly, the mix of activity that\u2019s driving new tower leasing on the tower leasing side is about 50% is new installs on existing assets and then about 50% is amendment activity. So in terms of revenue \u2013 incremental revenue growth that we\u2019re experiencing across the portfolio, that\u2019s the drivers.","From a pricing standpoint, as we agree with customers around what the activity is going to look like on how we price that, the majority of the activity that we see on the tower side, both for new installs as well as amendments, we\u2019ve agreed with our customers around what the price component looks like. So they\u2019ll come back and tell us how many antennas or lines or other things or space they need at the base of the tower, and we would have agreed a fee schedule with them that would cover basically all of the assets.","But each of the customers, depending on the spectrum bands that they\u2019re using, the markets that they\u2019re using, there would be varying levels of commitment on the tower side as to how much activity they\u2019ve committed to related to that, but the pricing has been mostly fixed. On the small cell side, we really have not done that in any way with the wireless operators. Those contracts, as we\u2019ve talked about on past calls, it\u2019s highly dependent upon the cost structure of the asset by market.","So while in towers, there\u2019s a national \u2013 there\u2019s, in essence, a national pricing schedule that we can agree with the carriers, we\u2019ve got to get very granular on the small cell side to understand the mix of aerial versus buried fiber, the regulatory fees or processes in a given market. And that can change pretty dramatically what the pricing schedule is with the carrier depending on the market and where in the market their desire is for small cells. So there\u2019s not a way to do that easily on a national basis, so we basically need to go market-by-market and agree pricing at that level.","Jon Atkin","Can you \u2013 just as a corollary and you can maybe answer it later in the call if you don\u2019t have it handy, but a year ago, what was that mix that you indicated for this most recent quarter between new installs and amendments? And then kind of further down on the small cell question, can you maybe give a sense to the pipeline and how concentrated it is by customer? Is it like 30-30, 20-20 or 40-30, 20-10? Or how would you kind of characterize the diversity of the demand?","Jay Brown","Yes. On your question about a year ago, maybe Dan or somebody can grab that number, but I believe it was about 60% amendments, 40% new installs. We were between 60% and 65% amendments over the last \u2013 really longer than a year ago, we could go back probably 24 months to 36 months, and it was pretty steady where about two-thirds of the activity was being driven by amendments and one-third by new installs. So we\u2019ve seen a little bit of an increase in new \u2013 first-time installs relative to amendments in more recent periods.","With regards to the pipeline, we\u2019re continuing to see activity across all four of the wireless operators, so there\u2019s a good mix of small-cell activity from all of the operators. And it varies by market as to what their focus is, but we\u2019ve got significant activities underway from each of the big four.","Dan Schlanger","And Jon, as we have disclosed historically, we\u2019re about 65,000 small cells on air and under development, and that was true at the end of last quarter. It\u2019s true again at the end of this quarter. It\u2019s just moved a little bit from \u2013 what we said last quarter was about 50-50 between on air and under development. Now we\u2019re about 35,000 on air and 30,000 under development or in the pipeline. As we put more nodes on air and didn\u2019t have substantial bookings in this quarter, but that was not unexpected just given the pace of bookings that we had through last year, and sometimes they are lumpy. So it doesn\u2019t speak to any change in activity levels or what our expectations are going forward. It\u2019s just a shift right now between on air and under development.","Jon Atkin","And then last one for me. I think you alluded to it in the question Josh asked. But e-rates and kind of seasonality sounds like you didn\u2019t really see much, but I wondered if you can sort of confirm that. And then what\u2019s the competitive dynamics for e-rate? Is it basically highly competitive or less so and very much dependent on your routes? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Yes. I would say the same thing I said to Josh about the seasonality. There\u2019s some seasonality as those contracts come up and schools look at what their fiber needs are going to be for the next school year. Depending on the timing at which they do that, there can be some seasonality in that. Given the size of our business though, that\u2019s really a very small component. So while some elements may have a little bit of seasonality to it, I think at the overall, it just does not impact the financial statements.","Similar \u2013 on your competitive question, similar to what we\u2019ve seen in all of the infrastructure businesses, having assets in the right location is most of the time what drives the answer to how competitive a space is. And the same thing is true in fiber. So generally speaking, there are a limited number of providers who can provide high-capacity, dense urban fiber. And depending on where our routes are and where our fiber is, we\u2019re going to have a high likelihood of winning some of that business. To the extent that we don\u2019t, then it may be a part of the market where we\u2019re not competitive and may choose not even to bid because the economics just won\u2019t reflect an appropriate return.","Jon Atkin","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.","Nick Del Deo","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. To put a finer point on an earlier question, if we assume a reasonable growth rate and revenue share for small cells, it looks like fiber solutions revenue is flat or down sequentially this quarter, and that\u2019s after it looked like it had been flatter down sequentially two quarters ago. Is that correct? And is there anything we should be aware of here? And I guess more generally, can you describe your confidence in the longer-term mid-single-digit growth outlook you\u2019ve laid out for fiber solutions, not for 2019 which you reaffirmed, but the outlook beyond that?","Dan Schlanger","Yes. Nick, the growth rate of fiber solutions in the first quarter was lower than what our fiber long-term growth rate is. But we still think that \u2013 as we mentioned and as Jay mentioned about 2019, we still think we\u2019ll get to that 5% or mid-single digit growth rate and still have confidence that beyond that, we\u2019ll be able to make that happen. There\u2019s nothing specific that happened in the quarter. It\u2019s not something that gives us a lot of concern at all because it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s timing of when bookings happen when things go on air. It\u2019s not something that changed obviously the outlook for 2019.","Nick Del Deo","Okay, got it. And then Sprint is talking about having deployed almost 20,000 small cells on Altice\u2019s HFC plans. Now there are obviously puts and takes associated with using coax rather than fiber. It\u2019s probably pretty cheap to put up. If we eventually see the other cable operators strike analogous arrangements with other carriers, do you see this being relevant for your small cell business?","Jay Brown","I think I would \u2013 just stepping back, Nick, broadly. When we look at the amount of spectrum that\u2019s laying silo in the hands of operators and the spectrum that is likely to come to market over the next coming decade based on what the FCC has talked about, there\u2019s going to need to be a significant amount of deployment activities. And I suspect that both the wireless operators as well as cable companies, there may be other entrants into the market that want to have network elements beyond just who we would think of today as owning networks. And they are going to look across the board at opportunities to use infrastructure and are going to need to use a number of different types of facilities in order to deploy that spectrum.","So when I see things like what you\u2019re mentioning, I think that will be one of the elements that are used in order to fill the need for spectrum deployment. But I believe the pie is going to be so large that it\u2019s not going to be detrimental to our growth rates or expected growth rates that those kind of things are going to happen. I think it\u2019s somewhat analogous to \u2013 so I remember back years ago when we were kind of moving from 2G to 2.5G, 3G and people were really concerned about what Wi-Fi was going to do to our business and there are a lot of fears that Wi-Fi was going to completely offload the need for the deployment of spectrum on towers. And the growth has more than overcome that, so the growth and the demand on the networks.","And at the same time, our customers are going to look for the lowest-cost provision to deliver network resources to the consumer to meet the needs. So I think what you highlighted is one of the ways that they will look for a way to supplement their network deployments. But I think it\u2019s just one component of it, and I don\u2019t believe that will be impactful to our long-term growth rates.","Dan Schlanger","Yes. And just piggybacking on that a little bit. As I look at \u2013 as our customers look to deploy network as inexpensively and efficiently as possible, that\u2019s where we come in because we\u2019re able to share the asset among all of the customers and share those economics that, that is exactly the value that we bring is to be able to deploy all of that spectrum in the most efficient way possible, which is why we\u2019re so excited about the future is that we think we have the right assets in the right places to allow our customers to meet the increasing demand over time with the least expense and the most efficient manner.","Nick Del Deo","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.","Ric Prentiss","Yes. Hey, guys, good morning.","Jay Brown","Hey, Ric.","Ric Prentiss","Can you hear me, okay.","Jay Brown","Yes, we can.","Ric Prentiss","Okay, good morning. I want to follow up on a couple of questions, your answer back on Jonathan\u2019s question about the nodes. Jay, I think you mentioned that you want to \u2013 you\u2019re thinking that you could do 2x what you did in 2018 as far as nodes on air. Can you remind us how much you did in 2018 just so we kind of have a framework?","Jay Brown","We did about 7,500 in 2018, so we expect to be in the ballpark of about 15,000 in 2019.","Ric Prentiss","That\u2019s great. And Dan, you mentioned seasonality, I appreciate that. 2Q usually is the low quarter because of cash taxes and the ability to do maintenance. Some other seasonal ones we had a question on, your services business in the first quarter was really strong as far as gross margins, but the guidance as far as what services would contribute in 2019 didn\u2019t change. How should we think about \u2013 is it that it\u2019s going to fall off in the second part of the year? Or is there something contractual or are you just being conservative? How should we think about the services business?","Dan Schlanger","First, I just want to remind you that when we talk about fourth quarter services business, we said there was about $5 million that pushed off due to timing. So you can see that, that could hit in the first quarter. So I don\u2019t think that we \u2013 in our guidance going forward, we do not anticipate a slowdown necessarily. What we anticipate is a continuation of the type of activity that we see and have seen, as Jay mentioned, on the tower side. So we think it\u2019s going to be continuing activity. We\u2019re excited about it, and it really is timing is what you\u2019re seeing more than anything.","Ric Prentiss","Okay, that makes sense. And then also there was a little spike-up in corporate SG&A in the first quarter. Is that a good run rate? Or what was going on there? Is there anything out of \u2013 kind of unusual out of period there?","Dan Schlanger","Yes. There were a few things that \u2013 we\u2019re not going to call out a tick-and-tie that probably pushed it up a little bit. But the reason that we\u2019re able to maintain our guidance over the course of 2019 is we anticipate to be where we thought we were going to be last quarter, so everything we think is in line with what we had anticipated before, so nothing really substantial one way or the other.","Ric Prentiss","And last one for me. When you think about keeping your balance sheet balanced and funding the capital program that you mentioned that you guys are excited to keep rolling out fiber with build versus buying acquisitions. How do you think about debt raising versus equity raising as far as funding the capital program? I think you said this year, it\u2019s going to be debt. But how do you think about that given where interest rates might be headed or where your stock price is at?","Dan Schlanger","Yes. So what we look at is \u2013 we are committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating, which we think takes about five time leverage. So what we\u2019re trying to do is maintain that five times debt-to-EBITDA target or close to it as we can, and which means that if we can grow our EBITDA and have sufficient leverage capacity associated with that, that can cover our capital program, then that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. If we then have a capital program that is in excess of our cash flows and our EBITDA leverage growth or leverage capacity growth, then we\u2019ll go out and sell equity.","For 2019, what we anticipate is that the EBITDA growth will lead to leverage capacity that will allow us to fund our capital program with debt, and that doesn\u2019t change just because our stock price is somewhere or is not. And when we look forward though, as we see more capital commitments come, we\u2019ll have to do that calculus again and determine whether the EBITDA growth will allow us to spend the money and utilize debt to spend for that capital or whether it requires some equity. But generally speaking, we\u2019re trying to minimize the amount of equity we issue, so keeping that five time debt leverage is where we\u2019re headed.","And to the extent that we get to the point where we want to sell equity or need to sell equity to maintain that five times leverage, then we\u2019ll try to do it at the highest price possible and limit the number of shares we put out.","Ric Prentiss","Makes sense. Appreciate the color guys. Have a good day.","Dan Schlanger","Thanks, Ric.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael","Great, thank you. Two questions, if I may. One is just a housekeeping item on CapEx. I think last quarter, you guys had indicated you expect to spend roughly $2 billion and just some of the commentary on this call seems to focus on continuing to push forward with investment, and I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s still the expectation. And then I guess to that point as it relates to capital raising and debt and equity and all that good stuff, when I look at your debt financing that I think that you\u2019ll need for this year assuming a target of maintaining that five turns of leverage, even when I do that, I look at your interest expense and it seems like your guidance for the year seems low. I mean even if you take the first quarter at $168 million, that\u2019s $672 million annualized versus your guidance of $687 million to $732 million. What would drive the interest expense up to the levels that you\u2019re still assuming in your guidance? Thank you.","Jay Brown","On the first question around CapEx, we\u2019re not changing our outlook for 2019, so we still think that we\u2019ll be investing about $2 billion of capital in the calendar year. My comments around our desire to continue to invest are more forward looking than just 2019 and are reflective of the environment that we\u2019re seeing and the actions that our carriers are taking against the shared infrastructure that we\u2019ve built both on the fiber and tower side. And we are continuing to pursue and look for opportunities on that front.","And as we\u2019ve mentioned, because the build schedule is so long, 18 to 24 months in those cases, to the extent that there was a change in the trajectory of capital needs, you\u2019ll see that show up in our commentary around what the pipeline is and how many nodes are to come. If that were to change meaningfully, then I think what you were trying to determine, Colby, around the trajectory and is there growth there, then we would let you know as early as we could around here\u2019s where we think the trajectory on capital spending is going to go. But for 2019, we don\u2019t need to make any changes. We think it\u2019s going to be about $2 billion in the calendar year.","Dan Schlanger","Yes. And Colby, on the interest expense, I\u2019m going to try to answer your question, but I\u2019m not sure I got it completely, so jump back on and ask if I missed it. But there are a lot of assumptions that go into that interest expense forecast, including timing of debt raises, what we use on revolver, how we term it out, what the interest rate is going to be. So all of that is baked into our best guess of what interest expense will look like, and that is what is reflected in our guidance. And what I couldn\u2019t tell is whether you\u2019re asking why it was too high or too low. So\u2026","Colby Synesael","If I look at the $168 million that you just did in the quarter and simply annualize that, you get to $672 million in the range for your interest expense guidance, which obviously impacts your AFFO. It\u2019s $687 million to $732 million. And even if I assume you raised debt with the assumption you maintain something around five turns of leverage, it still seems difficult to get to that $687 million to $732 million range.","Jay Brown","Yes. Okay. So I understand your question. What I would say again is just it has a lot of assumptions that go into that, and that\u2019s why we give a range. We think that range is appropriate for what we anticipate our funding sources will be to pay for the capital expenditures we have in 2019.","Colby Synesael","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Niknam","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. On the small cell business, so I\u2019m just curious, is the FCC small-cell order that came out late last year, is that helping you streamline the timing for deployment at least on the margin from the traditional 18 to 24 months you talked about in the past? And if not today, when do you anticipate this 18 to 24-month window shrinking over time? And then just secondly, on leasing activity, any meaningful contribution on the site leasing front you\u2019d call out from non-traditional customers, so sort of beyond the Big 4 wireless carriers in the quarter? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Matthew, on your first question around the benefit of the FCC order, it has been beneficial primarily because it has given more certainty around cost and timing of navigating the local municipalities. So it has been helpful on that front, particularly in markets and locations where there was an absolute blocker that had been put up by local municipalities. The FCC order has been very helpful in starting to move some of those locations off of an absolute prohibition of getting it done.","So it\u2019s been helpful on that front. As I\u2019ve mentioned, though, in past calls on this topic, I would not anticipate that the time line of building nodes would shorten considerably from what we\u2019ve seen 18 to 24 months of time line to build small cells. Even with the FCC order, there\u2019s still a significant amount of coordination that has to happen with local municipalities as we work to deploy small cells in the public right of way. And I don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that\u2019s likely to shorten that deployment schedule by a meaningful amount as I look at the nationwide average of 18 to 24 months.","So I would not assume that, that happens. From a pragmatic standpoint, the amount of activity that we\u2019re seeing in small cells as we talked about the doubling of the number of nodes that we\u2019re going to put on air, that puts tremendous pressure at the regulatory level of local municipalities to process applications and also on the utility side. So in some cases, we\u2019ve seen \u2013 while the FCC order has been very helpful, there\u2019s another long pole in the tent in terms of just sheer volume and the amount of volume that we\u2019re now trying to push through at the municipality level for application approvals and through utilities bringing power to these locations in order to get small cells on air.","So the amount of activity that we have seen and have staffed up for is not \u2013 there\u2019s not necessarily the same correlation at the local municipality and utility level to process applications. So that\u2019s certainly a challenge of the overall system. On the leasing front\u2026","Dan Schlanger","Yes. So the contribution of non-traditional customers, I think what we\u2019ve said and we try not to talk specifically about customers is tat we are seeing some demand coming from pockets other than the Big 4 carriers that is driving some of our demand right now, and it\u2019s something that we think will continue and we\u2019re excited about.","Matthew Niknam","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Gutman","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. You said there was limited new small-cell bookings in the quarter, but I don\u2019t know if you provided the breakout of the \u2013 I think it was $87 million of new leasing between the three respective segments. And I was wondering out of the small-cell backlog, not sure if you\u2019ve provided sort of the breakout of what proportion are second tenant builds versus initial builds.","Dan Schlanger","Yes. So what I was speaking to is our \u2013 as I\u2019ve said before, the total number of small-cell nodes on air and under development remained about 65,000. It\u2019s just the shift happened from about a 50-50 split between the two into more being on air, about 35,000 on air and 30,000 under development. And that we \u2013 what that means basically is that we won a huge number of bookings in the quarter. As we look out and Jay said, there\u2019s a lot of anticipation of continuation of bookings because the pace of activity has not changed very much. And so we\u2019re excited about what the future looks like.","And part of that is because, to your second question, around what is new anchor builds versus co-location, it remained about the same about 80% anchor build and 20% co-location or somewhere in that general vicinity because we\u2019re continuing to build out both within the markets that we have and then expanding within those markets into new geographic regions of those markets. So what we\u2019re excited about with that is all that does is provide new assets that we believe over time will be the driver of what Jay was talking about earlier of incremental margin once the asset does stabilize. So we are happy with that proportion of anchor build remaining in that 70%, 80% range. It really hasn\u2019t changed for a while now.","Jay Brown","Robert, just to pick up on Dan\u2019s point, which is, I think, really helpful context to some of the things I was making comments around earlier around the continued building out of new markets in areas of the market. If you take roughly, and I\u2019m not trying to pin the number down exactly, but if you take about 20% of the activity that we\u2019ll see in calendar year 2019 on small cells going on air, that means in the neighborhood of about 3,000 co-locations are going to happen in calendar year 2019. If we go backwards three or four years, you\u2019re talking about well over half of the total nodes that we put on air in those years are now in the form of co-locations.","So we\u2019re seeing the legacy assets that we have continue to grow the amount of co-locations that are going across them. But as we talk about scaling and continuing to, as we are in calendar year 2019 or expect to in 2019, doubling the amount of activity, that 20% of co-locations, the percentage doesn\u2019t lie to you because the numbers are growing so large in terms of the amount of investment that we\u2019re making. But the number of proof points that we have that the co-location model is working is increasing significantly, far more than just talking about the percentages of breakout between co-location and new leasing would suggest.","Robert Gutman","Great, thanks. And any color on fiber versus micro tower in the new leasing number for the quarter?","Dan Schlanger","Yes. We\u2019re not going to break that out quarter-by-quarter. Just the color is that for 2019, it remains the same at that 70 to 80 on small cell and 160 to 170 on fiber solutions.","Robert Gutman","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now move on to our next question from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk","Thanks. If you have a customer on the small cell that has LTE and then they add a 5G, is that an amendment or a new lease-up? And if it\u2019s an amendment, what\u2019s typically the percentage at from what they were paying for the original 4G small cell?","Jay Brown","Walter, probably the best way to describe it, and this is generality because there could be cases where this answer would not be the case, so I don\u2019t mean it to be blanket 100%. But generally speaking, that would look like a brand-new tenant on the small cell system. The types of equipment that we expect to see in 5G would result in them using up another entire slot on the \u2013 in the cabinet, and so it\u2019s likely that it would look much more like a full tenant than it would look like an amendment. And so economically, when we talk about adding the second tenant, exceeding \u2013 basically getting into a place where we\u2019re exceeding our cost of capital, that\u2019s the way the economics would follow, generally speaking.","Dan Schlanger","And also...","Walter Piecyk","So the deployment that I saw, it was basically taking a slot on a lamppost. So for sure, they were taking a slot where another carrier was then, right? So there has to be a new lease.","Jay Brown","Exactly right.","Dan Schlanger","And it also is taking another pair of fiber. So with a lot of the capital being in the fiber, it really is based on the fact that we\u2019re utilizing that shared asset again, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the economics.","Walter Piecyk","Got it. And then when we think long term in terms of trying to size the market and the number of small cells, obviously, extremely early stage at 15,000 a year. And Jay, you and I have talked in the past about whatever, a much larger number on an annual basis. What do you think we should think about in terms of a 30-foot elevation, whether it\u2019s LTE or 5G, in terms of feet or meters of coverage when we\u2019re trying to size the number of small cells that will exist in a market?","Jay Brown","I think it\u2019s hard to answer that question because of the way these things, I think, will likely get deployed by municipality. How much space do they take up will be driven by a lot of local market dynamics around how many feet can you put on a different pole, how tall are their poles, what area inside of the market are they\u2026","Walter Piecyk","Sorry to interrupt, Jay, I meant feet of coverage, not feet on the lamppost, feet of the coverage of what the small cell reaches.","Jay Brown","Probably \u2013 I think what we\u2019re seeing today would look something like a city block in most cases is the coverage that you\u2019re getting out of it. In dense urban areas, you\u2019re really covering the streets in between buildings and maybe some in building coverage. As you get to more of the suburban deployments, you might cover a little bit more than a few hundred yards but not much more than that. That\u2019s about the limitation of what you\u2019re going to use small cells to cover.","Walter Piecyk","Right. So a city block, I think typically, unless you\u2019re talking about the big avenues in New York, are about 350 feet? Does that sound about right?","Jay Brown","It\u2019s about \u2013 I was just going to say it might be a little longer than that in some suburbia. But generally speaking, that\u2019s a pretty good measure.","Walter Piecyk","Got it. And just one last quick question. In the last six months, have you gotten any inquiries from infrastructure investment funds for a possible acquisition of the company?","Jay Brown","I\u2019m not going to comment specifically on any potential deals out there. I think if you look at our investor mix, you\u2019ve seen a couple of things over the last several years. One is we\u2019ve seen more real estate investors come towards the space. I think as time has passed and we\u2019ve been able to tell the story across the industry with our other two public peers, I think that has helped and has attracted some real estate money. And then infrastructure funds around the world, as they\u2019ve looked at various businesses, again, the two public peers being able to tell the story of the nature of our business has attracted more capital. So I think as a proportion of overall capital in our firm, it\u2019s grown in terms of infrastructure investors and real estate investors.","Walter Piecyk","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move on to our next question from Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi","Great, thank you. First, can you provide an update on enterprise churns, what you\u2019re seeing there? And I believe you mentioned that you would lean towards building fiber versus buying asset. Can you provide more color on that? Is that a change in valuations or type of asset that you see available? And on the macro side, can you remind us how much churn do you expect from the acquired networks this year? And does that all come off next year. And one final one, tenants per tower ticked down slightly, 2.1. Is it just rounding? Anything to call out there? Thank you.","Dan Schlanger","Yes. Thanks, Batya. Again, if I missed one, just come back and ask. But on fiber solutions churn, we still anticipate it to be in the high single digits and believe that\u2019s generally where it was for the quarter. Building versus buying fiber, that\u2019s really not anything to do with valuation. It has to do with when we look out and look at the universe of potential acquisitions, the ability to meet the criteria that we utilize for purchasing fiber has diminished over time because we\u2019ve bought a lot of the assets that we\u2019re really interested in.","So what we\u2019re looking for is high-capacity fiber that has a lot of density in market, in the top 25 or 30 markets in the U.S. And there are just not that many \u2013 there are not that many targets out there that we would be interested in that meet all of those criteria. So it has very little to do with valuation and much more to do with strategic fit with our goal of putting small cells and fiber in the top markets in the U.S.","From a macro standpoint on the churn from acquisitions, we had about \u2013 our churn is in the 1% to 2% range. It\u2019s about 2% this year. About half of that is from the acquired network churn. And we believe that most of that will be done through the course of 2020. It\u2019s just that because it happens through 2019, there will be some rollover effect of that acquired network churn into 2020.","And then the tenant per tower going from 2.2 to 2.1, it really is rounding. But also just to remind you, it doesn\u2019t take into account amendments, so it is not a real great measure of the activity we see on our towers. As we\u2019ve been talking, the activity we\u2019re seeing is increasing as our customers are spending to keep up with the data demand. And that is driving significant new leasing, which is a better measure of what that \u2013 of what the activity levels are on our tower business.","Batya Levi","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Tim Horan","I guess there\u2019s some concern out there that the small cell radiuses are not going to be big enough to kind of support the cost for the small cell or that we\u2019re not going to be able to kind of generate incremental revenue from 5G or whatever deploying. Obviously, you\u2019re making a pretty big bet here. Any thoughts on that?","Jay Brown","I think the challenge that the carriers are trying to solve is the amount of data traffic that\u2019s going across \u2013 going across their networks. Towers are the most cost-effective way for them to deploy infrastructure and to broadcast spectrum, but those towers \u2013 a tower will lose its effectiveness in terms of geographic coverage and capacity at certain areas inside of the coverage area of that tower get tapped out by high usage. So they use small cells to basically underlay underneath the geographic coverage of towers to offload some of the \u2013 offload some of the data traffic demand in order to return the tower to its full effectiveness.","So to isolate the economics on a single small cell really misses the broader point. The best analogy in terms of the design of the RF is to think about the towers as overhead lighting inside of the building and small cells are putting lamps, where you\u2019re focusing light in a particular area. And the combination of that obviously balances the light inside of a room. The same thing is true on the RF side in terms of balancing the spectrum inside of a general geographic coverage area. And so the radius frankly is not as important as is the small cell capable of offloading some of the traffic from the macro site in order to return it to its maximum effectiveness, and they deploy small cells in order to most cost effectively use their macro sites.","Tim Horan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our final question...","Jay Brown","And we have time for one more question.","Operator","So we\u2019ll take the final question from Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.","Spencer Kurn","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I\u2019ve got a question on small cells. Last week Verizon struck a deal with the city of San Diego to utilize their municipal infrastructure to deploy small cells and fiber throughout city. When I look at your fiber math, it looks like you have a lot of fiber in San Diego. So it seems like Verizon is kind of circumventing you in one of your key markets. Is this a concern for you? Or how do you sort of frame this type of activity in the context of achieving your targeted returns with your fiber investments? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Yes. You bet, Spencer. Broadly, the amount of activity that\u2019s going to be needed based on what we think data growth is going to happen and then as we move towards 5G is there\u2019s going to be \u2013 need to be a significant number of small cells that are deployed in order to meet the demand. We certainly don\u2019t expect that we\u2019re going to be the sole provider of all small cells in the U.S. And so at the moment, we think we\u2019re somewhere in the neighborhood of about 50% of all the small cells being deployed. Crown Castle is about 50% of that overall activity. But we don\u2019t have any expectation that we\u2019re going to continue to main that kind of market share given the likely growth in the overall market and demand for it.","At the moment, self-performed by the carriers would make up the majority of that other 50% that we\u2019re not doing. And we would expect that the carriers will continue to do that. I think you\u2019ll see over time that firms will go in and do deals with cities and municipalities in order to make deployments easier or faster. That\u2019s certainly not the first or only deal that has been done on that front. There are a number of transactions like that, that we have done with municipalities, where we\u2019ve gone on \u2013 gone in and worked with them in order to gain access to the infrastructure in the public right of way. And I think it\u2019s just good business to do it that way. We\u2019re all working collaboratively with the local municipalities in order to deploy small cells.","So when I see those kind of things and I think it\u2019s indicative of the overall broader market and the need for the deployment of infrastructure. But it frankly doesn\u2019t concern me in terms of impacting what we think our returns are or our growth rates. I think it\u2019s much more indicative of what the overall market growth and opportunity is.","Spencer Kurn","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks.","Jay Brown","You bet. Well, thanks everyone for joining us on the call this morning. I appreciate the questions and look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation.

Brown","Thank you, Fiona, and good morning, everyone. We had a great 2011 and we are excited about the leasing activity we are seeing in our portfolio. ","Let me quickly summarize some of our accomplishments during the year, and then I'll take you through some greater detail. ","Throughout 2011, we consistently delivered results above our original expectation. And we ended 2011, delivering another very strong quarter of results. ","For the full year, as shown on Slide 3, we posted growth in site rental revenue of 9%, site rental gross margin of 11%, adjusted EBITDA of 12% and adjusted funds from operations per share of 17%, compared to 2010. ","These results were considerably above our expectations at the beginning of 2011. Further, our services business continues to outperform our expectations, delivering strong growth in 2011 as we continue to work very hard to meet customer deployment objectives and facilitate customers' installations on our sites. ","In addition to our strong organic leasing results, we announced several important acquisitions. In December 2011, we announced an agreement to acquire NextG Networks for $1 billion, which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2012. ","NextG is the leading provider of distributed antenna systems or DAS. This acquisition puts us in the leadership position in providing small-cell solutions to our customers in addition to our existing leadership position in U.S. towers. We believe that DAS will make a meaningful contribution to site rental revenue growth in the next several years as these and other small-cell solutions become an increasingly important part of the wireless infrastructure, complementing our existing macro towers. Then we'll talk more about why we are excited about this investment later in the call. ","Further, earlier this month, we announced the agreement to acquire 2,300 Ground Lease Related Assets from Wireless Capital Partners or WCP, an immediately accretive acquisition. We expect to close WCP in the first quarter of 2012. ","Relative to other potential investments, we believe that both of these acquisitions will be accretive to our long-term growth rate and enhancing the shareholder value. ","Further, we recently announced that we are seeking to refinance our credit facility with a new $3.1 billion credit facility. The proceeds of the new facility are expected to be used to finance the NextG and WCP acquisitions and to finance our existing -- refinance our existing credit facility. We expect to close the transaction later this month with approximately $1 billion of undrawn revolver availability after the aforementioned acquisitions and refinancing. ","I would also highlight as you saw from our press release yesterday, we began providing funds from operations or FFO and adjusted funds from operations or AFFO metrics, which I'll walk you through shortly. ","With that, let me turn to Slide 4 as I highlight some of the results for the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, we generated site rental revenue of $471 million, up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2010. Site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenues less cost of operations was $351 million, up 8% from the fourth quarter of 2010. ","Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $335 million, up 8% from the fourth quarter of 2010. ","It is important to note that these growth rates were achieved almost entirely through organic growth on assets that we owned as of January 1, 2011 as revenue growth from acquisitions was negligible. AFFO, which I will describe in more detail later, was $193 million, up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2010 or $0.68 per share, up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2010, as shown on Slide 5. ","There were no significant non-recurring items in the fourth quarter of 2011. ","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended 2011 pro forma for the acquisitions on our new credit facility with total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately 6x and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense of approximately 3x. Pro forma, both our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio and cash interest expense coverage ratio are comfortably within their respective debt covenants requirements. ","Moving on to investments and liquidity. We expect to close on our new credit facilities on January 31 with the blended coupon based on current LIBOR of approximately 3.7% on the $2.1 billion of funded term loan. ","In addition, we expect to have $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. This gives us tremendous flexibility for investing activities that we expect will enhance long-term AFFO per share which we expect -- which we believe is the best long-term measure of shareholder value creation. ","During the fourth quarter, we invested $104 million as illustrated on Slide 6, including $83 million on capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $33 million on our land purchase program. ","In total, during 2011, we extended over 1,200 land leases and purchased land beneath more than 600 of our towers. ","As of today, we own or control for more than 20 years, the land beneath towers representing approximately 76% of our gross margin, up from 70% a year ago. ","In fact, today, 38% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own, up from 34% a year ago. ","Further, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 32 years. Having completed over 11,000 land transactions, we believe this activity has resulted in the most secure land position in the industry based on land ownership and final ground lease expiration.","We continue to believe this is an important endeavor that provides a long-term benefit as it protects our margins and controls our largest operating expense. ","Further, our recent acquisition of the ground leases from WCP, which are predominantly under our customers' towers, allows us to apply the expertise we have gained as the industry leader in land lease extension and purchase. Of the remaining capital expenditures, we spend $9 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $41 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures, the latter consisting of $28 million on existing sites and $13 million on the construction of new sites. ","During the fourth quarter, the acquisitions I previously discussed replaced our share purchase activity. For the full year 2011, we purchased 7.7 million common shares and potential shares, spending $318 million. Since 2003, we have spent $2.7 billion to purchase approximately 100 million of our common shares and potential shares at an average price of $26.85 per share. ","Also in January, we announced the conversion of the remaining $305 million of our 6.25% convertible preferred stock, which will result in the issuance of 8.3 million common shares and eliminate an annual dividend of approximately $19 million. ","For the full year 2011, as illustrated on Slide 7 and 8 of the presentation, site rental revenues were approximately $1.9 billion, up 9% from the full year 2010. Approximately 5% of the growth was attributable to the additional tenant equipment added to our sites, reflecting the strong leasing activity we enjoyed in 2011. And approximately 4% of the growth came from the existing base of business that was in place at the beginning of 2011 through contracted escalators and renewal of tenant leases net of any churn. ","Site rental gross margin grew 11% from the full year 2010 to $1.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2011 was $1.3 billion, up 12% from the full year 2010 and AFFO per share increased 17% from the full year 2010 to $2.58 for the full year 2011. ","I would note that due to our rigorous control on cost in 2011, approximately 90% of the growth in site rental revenue found its way to site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. ","Turning to Slide 9, while we are only a month into 2012, we are seeing encouraging signs of the continued growth fueled largely by AT&T and Verizon overlaying 4G networks and Sprint actively deploying their Network Vision program. In our full year 2012 outlook, we have not included the expected impact from our acquisitions of WCP and NextG or our $3.1 billion credit facility. We would expect to include the impact of these in our quarterly earnings announcement following each respective closing. We expect site rental revenue growth in 2012 of approximately $90 million, wholly comprised of new leasing activity in the form of amendments to existing installations and brand-new installations on our site. This is in line with the growth in organic leasing we have enjoyed since approximately 2007. We expect the vast majority of this revenue in 2012 to come from Verizon, AT&T and Sprint. ","As shown in our outlook on Slide 10, we expect AFFO growth of approximately 11% in 2012. We would expect to augment this growth through opportunistic investment of cash flow and activities such as share purchases, tower acquisitions, new site construction and land purchases. ","Even with our recent acquisition announcements, we expect to have significant cash to invest in activities that we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share growth. ","During 2012, we expect to generate approximately $810 million of AFFO and invest approximately $325 million on capital expenditures related to purchases of land beneath our towers, the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites, including distributed antenna systems. ","In addition, if we were to leverage at 5x, our expected growth in adjusted EBITDA, we would have an additional approximately $400 million to invest. ","In total, this is approximately $1.2 billion of investment capacity for 2012. Ignoring our borrowing capacity, the portion of our AFFO after expected capital expenditures represents a little over $100 million per quarter of cash flow that we could invest in activities related to our core business, including purchases of our shares and acquisition. Consistent with our past practice, we are focused on investing our cash in activities we believe will maximize that measure long-term AFFO per share. I believe that this level of capital investment can add between 4% and 6% to our organic AFFO per share growth rate annually. ","Before I turn the call over to Ben, I would like to walk you through our new financial metrics as outlined on Slide 11. As you've seen from our press release, we began providing FFO and AFFO metrics this quarter with the aim to provide additional transparency and a comparable metric to others in the tower industry and a broader REIT universe. We continue to expect that we will convert to a REIT no later than the exhaustion of our net operating losses, which we currently expect to consume by approximately 2016. ","During the second half of 2011, we began some of the preliminary work that will be necessary to make the conversion of this tax efficient capital structure in the future. While we've not made a decision to convert to a REIT, we do believe it is a likely outcome given the current tax efficiency of the structure. ","As such, we decided to provide the same AFFO metrics used by our peer, American Tower. For the first time in the history of the tower industry, there will be a metric that is calculated the same across multiple tower companies. I am hopeful that this definition of AFFO will become the metric that investors will use when evaluating companies in the tower industry. I believe the metric is indicative of the dividend capacity of our industry and applaud American Tower for leading the way in defining the metric last quarter. ","As many of you know, FFO and AFFO are widely used in the REIT industry. Long term, we believe it will be important for REIT and other investors to be able to evaluate Crown Castle on this basis. And by initiating the use of these metrics now, we will hopefully demonstrate the long-term stability and growth of our business through good and bad economic periods. Similar to our past practice of discussing recurring cash flow or RCF on a per-share basis, we will focus the majority of our value creation discussion on AFFO per share. Certainly, we will be making our capital allocation decisions based on our goal of maximizing long-term AFFO per share. ","To aid the transition to this metric, we have provided the FFO and AFFO metrics for the full years from 2007 through 2011 with quarterly details for 2010 and 2011 in the supplement we posted along with our earnings release yesterday. ","I would also note that cumulatively, our new AFFO metrics would have yielded essentially the same results as our historical RCF metric since 2007. As noted, the cumulative difference between AFFO and RCF from 2010 through 2012 is only $14 million, less than 0.5% of the $3.7 billion of recurring cash flow over these periods. ","Our AFFO metric will provide more specificity with regards to straight-line revenue, straight-line expense and non-cash interest expense. The impact of these 3 items largely offset one another over the last 5 years. As adopted, our AFFO metric adjusts for the impact of straight-line revenues and expenses. As I've mentioned in the past, we've been able to recognize site rental revenues in advance of the cash received from our customers due to the extension of contracts with our customers. ","In fact, our revenue growth from 2009 through 2011 benefited by approximately 150 to 200 basis points per year from lease renewals. We have been very successful and we're working with our customers to extend the terms of our contracts.","Over the past 3 years, we've been able to renew and extend approximately 45% of our customer contracts with initial terms of up to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant. Due to these long-term customer contracts with fixed escalations, we've been recognizing site rental revenues in advance of the contracted cash payments from our customers in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Also, we have been recognizing higher site rental expense than actual cash rental payment as a result of renewing our ground leases with fixed escalation for long periods of time. ","As shown on Slide 12, we have graphed all of our existing leases, both our revenue tenant leases and our expense ground leases for years 2012 through 2020, showing the expected reported amount and the respective cash receipts and payments. ","As shown, we expect that at the beginning, that in the beginning into -- in about 2015, our cash receipts from tenant leases will exceed the amount of reported site rental revenue. For purposes of generating the graphs, we have assumed that all leases are renewed at term end dates. As illustrated in the graphs and based on the aforementioned assumptions, we expect that our cash receipts from our existing tenant licenses will grow at approximately 3.6% per annum for years 2012 to 2020. We have made no assumptions in the graphs with regards to additional tenant leases, tenant amendments or land purchases. ","We hope that you will find our additional disclosure in the adoption of an industry -- of industry standard metrics helpful in your analysis. To aid in the transition to AFFO and FFO from our current metric RCF, we will continue to provide the RCF metric through the end of 2012. ","In summary, we had a terrific 2011, with a number of significant accomplishments, and I'm very excited about 2012 as we continue to execute around our core business, integrate NextG and continue to allocate capital to enhance long-term AFFO per share. ","And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Ben.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Thanks Jay, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. We've got a lot to cover and as you can imagine, there's been a lot going on at Crown Castle. I want to take a couple of minutes to reflect on the tremendous year we had on a number of fronts. ","As Jay just mentioned, we had an excellent fourth quarter and finished the year very strong, growing site rental revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by 9%, 12%, and 17%, respectively. ","In addition to a strong year of site leasing, our U.S. Services business performed exceptionally well. This success results from a diligent effort to capture more of the revenue opportunities associated with assisting our customers in locating or upgrading installations on our sites. This increase in services activity is attributable to the confidence our customers have in Crown Castle through our disciplined and routine execution as regularly expressed in our customer surveys that consistently rank us as delivering the highest customer satisfaction in the industry. ","As I look out to 2012 and beyond, I'm as excited about the prospects for our business as in any time in my memory. Wireless data demands on these networks continue unabated. We have each of Verizon, AT&T and Sprint actively upgrading their networks, which is driving significant revenue growth on our sites. ","Further, we see renewed activity from T-Mobile as they react to remaining independent and seek to improve coverage, capacity and the economics of their network. Beyond the immediate demand we see, we believe longer term, we will benefit from new partnerships and applications yet to be identified that bring additional spectrum to the market with the need for our sites. It is the realization that we can extend our shared infrastructure model to assist customers in meeting these challenges that has led us to our decision to take a market-leading role in the DAS or small-cell site architecture business through our announced acquisition of NextG Networks. ","I'm excited to spend a few minutes with you this morning sharing my enthusiasm with you about walking through our thought process and why we believe this investment uniquely positions Crown Castle for the future and why we believe this transaction will be accretive to our growth rates and shareholder value. ","As mentioned by AT&T on their call this morning, as demand for data services accelerates, network architecture is expanding. And increasingly, we believe DAS will be an important complement to traditional tower installations. The acquisition of NextG furthers our capabilities in DAS, enabling us to provide more shared wireless infrastructure for customers beyond those areas served by traditional towers, thereby augmenting our service offering in this growing market. ","NextG is the leading provider of DAS with over 7,000 nodes on the air and a further 1,500 nodes under construction. Consistent with our focus on the top 100 BTAs in the U.S., over 90% of NextG's nodes are in urban and suburban locations with 80% in the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth. The NextG assets are expected to provide significant growth as they currently average only 1.25 tenants per network. ","Following the contemplated acquisition, we expect to be the largest independent operator of DAS systems in the U.S. with approximately 10,000 nodes, including 26 venues in over 20 university campuses in operation or under construction. Based on existing and contracted networks under construction, we expect the acquisition of NextG to have approximately $50 million of annualized run rate site rental gross margin when complete. ","At closing, we expect NextG to have approximately $17 million of annualized run rate G&A costs. The G&A costs are largely associated with developing and building new sites and leasing the existing networks. We consider these development costs to be an investment in building new systems currently under construction, and do not expect material benefit from synergies until 2013. ","I expect that as we work through the integration of NextG, we will achieve cost synergies, no doubt, but we will go slow at achieving these synergies as we want to ensure that we don't stifle the growth opportunity that we believe we can achieve in the DAS market. This acquisition is about scale, capability and growth and I don't want to spoil that opportunity with shortsighted cost synergies. ","In fact, I believe that this acquisition has the potential to deliver adjusted EBITDA of 5x to 6x its current level in 5 years, based on the commitment we believe wireless carriers are making to utilizing small-cell site solutions. ","Similar to the towers we acquired from the carriers a decade or so ago, these are largely single tenant assets that have tremendous lease-up potential. In fact, we've enjoyed much faster lease-up on our existing DAS portfolio compared to the tower lease-up rate, where it took a decade or so to reach an average tenancy of 3 carriers per tower. Our existing DAS networks are tracking to reach this level of tenancy much faster than what we saw on our traditional tower business and we have high expectations NextG systems will perform similarly well. ","There are many parallels and similarities between DAS and our existing tower business and there are a few differences. Let me take you through a few of the key questions that we had to answer before we were willing to make a $1 billion investment in DAS. ","First, is DAS a necessary component of the wireless infrastructure solution? Second, does DAS have similar barriers to entry that our towers enjoy? And third, is DAS similar enough to our existing infrastructure business to leverage our expertise and relationships? The resounding answer to all 3 of these questions is a yes, and let me walk you through some of our conclusions. We have included some slides to help facilitate this discussion. ","As most of you are aware, towers currently serve as the primary infrastructure solution for wireless communications. As the usage of wireless devices increase, there's an increasing need for small-cell architecture to help improve coverage, but more importantly, to help increase capacity in areas that can't be served by towers. Industry estimates suggest there could be as many as 6 to 10 small cells deployed for each macro cell tower site over the long term as carriers add capacity to meet consumer demand. We are still in the early stages of this infrastructure, similar to where we were with towers a decade ago. In fact, the opportunity we see feels a lot like the early tower days of the late '90s. ","Since 2003, we have gradually gained expertise in this area starting internally with a small-cell site -- a small DAS deployment team in specialized areas with minimal investment. As these early systems gained traction and carrier buy-in, we made a $115 million investment in DAS by acquiring NewPath networks in September of 2010. Since then, we've enjoyed significant growth in DAS from this relatively small acquisition. ","As a result, we began to look for ways to leverage on a larger scale what we learned from our NewPath acquisition and our carrier relationships and so we pursued NextG with the aim to become the largest operator of DAS networks in the U.S. and secure locations that would be nearly impossible to replicate. Like the early days of the tower industry, we believe the best assets are likely to be the first ones constructed in the most densely populated areas of the U.S. ","As illustrated in Slide 13, DAS networks are in many ways, similar to a tower simply laid on its side. Simply put, DAS is a network of antennas connected by fiber to a communications hub designed to facilitate wireless communication services for multiple operators. We rent space on our individual DAS antenna locations or nodes via long-term contracts. These contracts are generally at least 10 years in term with renewal options and annual escalation features. ","Similar to our towers, DAS can accommodate multiple customers for antennas and other equipment necessary for the transmission of signals for wireless communication devices. Typically a DAS network will consist of nodes or antennas mounted on utility poles, streetlamps or traffic signals connected by fiber to a base station radio in a remote location. The fiber routes are typically a combination of aerial cables strung pole to pole along a street or a cable buried in a conduit. ","On Slides 14 through 17, there are pictures of some completed DAS solutions. It may be helpful to talk about DAS in the context of towers. In our traditional tower business, we are responsible for building and maintaining the steel tower structure and renting ground space from the tower -- and renting -- and renting the ground on which the tower is located. In DAS, we are responsible for building and owning underground or aerial fiber for multiple tenants, utilizing the public right-of-way and locating antennas on streetlamps, traffic light or utility poles. The fiber component of a DAS installation is akin to the galvanized steel in a traditional tower. That is what we own and lease to customers in its most simple form. ","As in the traditional tower business, the wireless carrier is typically responsible for operating their base station equipment. Economically, a good rule of thumb is to think of a tower as roughly equivalent to 3 DAS nodes. So our portfolio pro forma of 10,000 DAS nodes including those under construction, relates to approximately 3,000 towers. ","To help frame it for you, you can think of the cost of a node as 1\/3 the cost of a typical tower and the rent we receive as 1\/3 of the rent we would receive for a typical tower installation. As in towers, the incremental margins on adding additional tenants are very high as the cost associated with adding tenants are negligible or subsidized by the additional tenant. A DAS can typically accommodate up to 5 tenants. The landlord is usually the municipality or a local utility company. ","The recurring rent associated with DAS can vary widely depending on the location, cost and complexity of the system. But typically, the rent is approximately 1\/3 of a typical tower lease. Importantly, as in the tower model, this is a shared infrastructure model and is a cost effective solution for wireless carriers when compared to the cost of owning the assets themselves and our return expectations are achieved through co-location. ","Examples of DAS we have installed include sports venues, such as stadiums and arenas where thousands of people are trying to utilize their smartphones to surf the Internet. Similarly, university students are typically early adopters of new communications technologies and mobile phones are no exception. Following the acquisition of NextG, we will have over 20 universities to offer wireless carriers access via a shared DAS network and these networks deliver excellent indoor and outdoor campus coverage in lecture halls, dormitories and sports venues. ","Further, in communities, particularly suburban and urban areas where there isn't space for towers or where zoning restrictions or space limit the construction of towers, we have developed DAS solutions by attaching small antennas and small equipment cabinets on existing utility poles or light poles. After combining with NextG, systems -- the NextG systems with our own, we will have DAS deployed in marquee locations such as the University of Notre Dame, Stanford University, Hilton Head Island, Colonial Williamsburg, Amway Center, high-end suburban locations such as Scottsdale, Arizona, dense urban environments like Manhattan and San Francisco and some of the most recognizable theme parks in the world. In short, I am thrilled about the portfolio of DAS networks we are acquiring and the talented people we expect will be joining Crown Castle. They will play an important role as we continue to grow and expand our small-cell site capability to deal with network capacity needs of the future. ","So to wrap up and go to questions, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results and believe they demonstrate the quality of our assets combined with our ability to execute for our customers. We remain disciplined and focused on maximizing long-term AFFO per share through growing our core business and making opportunistic investments and we have significant capacity to continue to do this in 2012. ","And finally, I'm excited we have positioned the company to be the clear leader in shared wireless infrastructure in the U.S. with unique capabilities to meet the current and future needs of our customers. ","With that, operator, I'll be pleased to turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, on the AFFO, again, thanks for that detail. We've seen a strong performance out of American Tower. Obviously, there's incremental investor demand I guess, not just from REIT investors, but other income investors. How are you thinking about waiting for all the NOLs to expire. I know you addressed that a little bit earlier versus maybe getting ready to move a little bit quicker if things change over time? And paying a dividend as a C Corp. And then if you could comment on any potential interest in T-Mobile towers as well, that would be great.","Jay A. Brown","Sure. Simon, I'll take the first couple of those and let Ben take the last one on T-Mobile. With regards to where we are as I mentioned in my comments, we expect to exhaust the net operating losses in about 2015, 2016 and would expect that no later than that date, we would convert to a REIT. Obviously, given the tax efficiency of the current structure as a REIT, we would benefit from not having to pay any taxes and would expect to take advantage of that at least in our current planning before we would become a taxpayer at the corporate level. With regards to doing that early, I think that's an evaluation we will continue to make on an ongoing basis and look at what we think the value of converting early is. As I mentioned, we've begun to do some of the preliminary work that would be necessary for us to do that and depending on kind of our forward view, we may choose to accelerate ahead of a 2015 or 2016 date or we may ultimately decide to stay as we're organized as a C Corp. With regards to paying a dividend before converting to a REIT, as we've talked about in the past, look, I think this is an opportunity for us to think about as we have historically, the allocation of capital. And to date, we spent about $2.7 billion returning cash to shareholders in the form of share purchases. And as we currently think about allocation of capital, that's our preference. However, we'll continue to entertain the opportunity of potentially translating that, transferring that return of cash to shareholders in the form of share purchases and may ultimately decide to do it in the form of a dividend. But I think therein lies a significant amount of flexibility. So as we think about flexibility and allocation of capital, the flexibility of being able to choose at this point whether to pay a dividend or not and having the NOL covered, we think is a valuable asset in addition, as I talked about in my comments, having a significant amount of availability under a revolver, either pursue share purchases or acquisition. I think we've got a tremendous amount of flexibility and we'll continue to evaluate that as we go.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Just to punctuate one thing, I think, we think the outside, when we used the NOLs, probably 4 years and we think that's the most efficient structure, as Jay mentioned, but we've got a lot of flexibility and we don't want to give that up casually. So we're going to think very we carefully about how we do that. Simon, you asked about the T-Mobile towers. I think we've all been reading the same press reports and I understand that potentially, there's  a consideration of them coming back on the market. You would expect us to be interested in taking a look at the asset. We certainly expect to do that, but I will tell you, we will be very disciplined about how we think about the value of the asset. We've got a lot on our plate. We are extremely excited as I mentioned in my remarks, about the growth prospects we have in front of us as a company, really positioned for the future and so we'll certainly take a look at any tower asset out there including this one, but I would expect us to be pretty disciplined in our review.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just 2 things, if I could. First, just with respect to kind of where the leverage is now, Jay, on the business, I think if this has been a year or a year and a half ago, you'd probably continue to talk about de-leveraging being a priority. If you could kind of revisit kind of where you stand in that context now. And then maybe, Ben, AT&T, we just ended the call where they talked about now that the T-Mobile deal's off the table, they're going to restart a cell-splitting exercise and a DAS initiative that they intend to fund into 2012. I was wondering, based on your agreement with AT&T, how do -- under what circumstances can you monetize those kinds of new spending from AT&T and have you already been approached by them?","Jay A. Brown","Sure, Dave, on the first question around leverage. We've talked about our target as being 4x to 6x and the great benefit we have in this business is that it de-leverages very quickly given the organic growth in the assets. And given our view of the acceleration of growth relative to traditional towers that we expect around NextG, that's going to be increasing the speed at which we would expect a normal course of the balance sheet to de-lever. So I think we'll continue to operate in the target. I think that this transaction that we just did illustrates the value of the flexibility that we created by running a little bit lower leverage and operating at the midpoint of our target range. So we're approximately going towards the end of 2011, we had approximately 5 turns of leverage and we spent a lot of time talking about our target leverage of potentially being willing to go up to 6x for the right asset. And as we looked at these 2 assets that became available in the back half of 2011, we were able to invest $1.5 billion in assets we think are growth enhancing, strategic and very important to the next generation of wireless. We were able to do that without issuing a single share of stock. And so we look at the value of the flexibility and would say about these acquisitions this is exactly why we were operating the balance sheet that we were. I would further say this is why I am excited about having $1 billion revolver because I think the revolver, which we expect to have a 5-year term, obviously I'll expect a balance sheet and would expect the normal course of the balance sheet will de-lever some over time, not through the pay down of debt but through a growth in EBITDA as we move back towards target, the middle part of the target of the range, we'll have a revolver there that's available for us to again, take advantage and be strategic when the right asset or opportunity is available to us. So I think as I mentioned, we'd expect that if we borrowed the growth in EBITDA at about 5x, there's $400 million of capacity during the year and investing the cash flows, another $800 million, so in a normal course, that's $1.2 billion to invest, but certainly wouldn't want to eliminate the possibility that we operate at the high end of that range for the right asset or the right opportunity.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Dave, let me take your question around cell splitting and AT&T's comments on their call this morning around creating more capacity within their network. Cell splitting, as you know, is just that. It's utilizing a new site and reducing the size of the cell that a prior site was covering. And so certainly, with the top 72% of our towers in the top 100 markets and significantly more than any of our peers, cell splitting and capacity challenges occur where population density is the greatest. And so we certainly expect to be working actively with our customer AT&T on accommodating their needs to split cells and we expect to have significant numbers of sites, in fact, many of them already, that would accommodate that type of activity around cell splitting. And so we would expect to see some activity going forward in that regard. Obviously, it's just January so it's a little bit early to put that into any kind of guidance or outlook, but you can bet we'll be very actively in those conversations and that fits right into the other conversation we were just having around about DAS systems and I believe that they actually mentioned DAS as a technology and architecture they're pursuing. We already do business with AT&T at the DAS level and would expect that again, as I mentioned in my remarks, DAS will play an increasingly meaningful role in helping AT&T and all the carriers meet the capacity challenges in these dense urban environments or other places where a macro tower site won't provide the capacity that's required. And just let me expand on that just a moment. Because having been in this DAS business now for about 7 years, there was a time when it was very challenging to profile the leasing opportunity for a DAS system because a lot of these areas had what we would all term as sort of minimal or substandard coverage, voice coverage, from a traditional tower site. Well obviously, that standard, maybe 5 or 6 years ago, of what you potentially needed to hold a voice call, is just wholly inadequate today as we are all burdening these networks with broadband Internet expectations. And that is really why now you've seen this small-cell site architecture really come into the forefront and be a technology that is widely accepted and adopted. And it's really demand based. It's the fact that the capacity challenges and the demand on the networks have really come to this architecture and made it now a very attractive solution. Whereas before, 5 or 7 years ago, we didn't have these capacity challenges typically on a network and so notwithstanding the technology that was there as an opportunity, the lease-up opportunity was more elongated or difficult to underwrite. So anyway, happy to answer that and appreciated obviously, AT&T's comments this morning on the capacity needs.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe first question just going back to -- the potential portfolios that might be out there, whether it's T-Mo or some of the private equity portfolios that may come up for grabs. The balance sheet, where it is now, understanding you've got revolver and the ability to lever incremental growth in EBITDA. It does seem like one of these deals potentially might require you to introduce equity and issue shares. I'm just wondering how you think through that. Is that something you're willing to do at this point? And then second question, we had talked on the third quarter call as it related to the 2012 outlook about Alltel and risk that they were going to de-commission, or Verizon was going to de-commission a substantial number of cell sites and I'm just wondering as we start to get into 2012, how that's tracking relative to the plan you laid out?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Sure, Jason, I'll take the first one. I'll just say we'll be very disciplined. We're pretty proud of our shares. You've seen what we've done to take out 1\/3 of the company over the last several years and we don't issue shares casually and so we'll be very disciplined in our review of any transaction that would require us to issue shares.","Jay A. Brown","On your second question, Jason, around churn. As I noted last quarter, we expect the churn in 2012 if you counted number of tenants, to be up about 10% over 2011. That increase was attributable as we mentioned, largely to Alltel. It's almost -- it's 70% loaded in the front half of 2012 and 30% in the back half of the year and the split in that first half is almost even. So higher churn in the first 2 quarters of this year and then in the back half, we're currently expecting significantly less churn and as we sit here today, we think it's on track for what we talked about last quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Thank you very much for transparency, AFFO, calculated the same way as American Tower. What a concept, to have one number exactly the same way so we all can do evaluation works, so thank you very much for that. Second, just to dig into some of the details on NextG, Ben, I think in your comments, you mentioned that the $50 million annual run rate on the gross margin side, the press release talked about $40 million and then another $10 million under construction. When does that $10 million come in?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, the vast majority of that will be over the first 12 months of ownership. In fact, potentially all of it in the first 12 months of ownership and that number obviously doesn't account for any additional business or leasing that you might expect. So that's just purely contracted. So we're having to swag the number a little bit here, but that's about as close as we can peg it.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned the $17 million G&A, no material synergies until 2013. And then you mentioned that the adjusted or the EBITDA impact could be 5x to 6x the current level in 5 years, was that referring to like the $40 million that you have currently less the $17 million? Just trying to gauge what you're trying to signal to us there.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Everybody's got to have a goal and we've got some pretty tall goals around here for this asset and so, if you come off the $33 million sort of run rate to start with, if you will, in terms of contracted less the full boat of G&A, could we see a business that's 5 to 6x bigger than that in 5 years? That's our expectation and certainly, our aspirational goal. And I will further say that I've not ever seen an opportunity in this industry where an asset that is in our case, 5% of the enterprise value of the company, could potentially, if you reverse engineer what I just said about growth, could potentially be well outside its size relative to contribution to growth. Many multiples of its relative size in terms of contribution to growth. And so we -- it's again -- it's incredibly analogous. The more time we spend on this, the more similar it feels and the economics, the more similar they feel to the original tower portfolios we acquired in 1999 where obviously, the carrier built sites in the major cities, have proven up over the last 12 years to be the most valuable and where revenue on those sites for example, just as we're revisiting history here, have more than tripled over the last 10 to 12 years. So again, we have high expectations and that's what that came from.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. And also in the original press release when you talked about the acquisition, you mentioned that you thought it would be neutral to AFFO per share initially, then obviously become quite accretive. In the press release, you also mentioned I think, $60 million in incremental interest expense from the new facility. Just trying to gauge what are you thinking as far as NextG itself as far as AFFO per share in 2012?","Jay A. Brown","Yes. I think it will be -- Rick, I think it will be about a push, still. The numbers have been mentioned in the first 12 months of about $33 million of adjusted EBITDA and that's about what the interest costs will be on that component. The whole number that we gave you there includes the impact of refinancing the existing credit facilities, the money that we're raising for WCP and a little extra funds that we'll have left over. So I think we're trying to help you with a couple of different numbers including where interest expense will be for the full year '12 if we're right about guessing on closing dates for the various acquisitions and closing dates on the debt.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So that $60 million included the assumption from Wireless Capital Partners?","Jay A. Brown","That's right, and maybe just to be -- put a finer point on it, we're still saying we think it's a push in the first 12 months for NextG relative to the cost of the money.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That helps a lot. And then another, just a logical question, when you mentioned Wireless Capital Partners, you said that the cash before interest expense would be the $42 million. Where's that going to get put? Is that going into revenue? Is that going into cost reductions? How should we think about where that will come through the financial statements? .","Jay A. Brown","Well, ultimately it will fall down to AFFO. And where it exactly falls above adjusted EBITDA, I think we're still working through exactly what that will look like and as I think after close, we'll take you through it.","Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then final question, T-Mobile, you mentioned you're starting to see some activity there. I assume that guidance for 2012 did not assume -- kind of caught a lot of people off guard, them throwing in the towel that quickly, any kind of renewed activity from T-Mobile?","Jay A. Brown","We did not include that. A vast majority of the activity we have on our outlook is from AT&T, Verizon and Sprint. We would've had some in there for T-Mobile.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie Capital.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","I think you mentioned in the past that you have over $300 million in annual ground lease expense. You already own considerably more land than your competitors. I wonder how do you view ground lease or other land purchase opportunities versus buying tower or additional DAS assets. And will the pace of land acquisitions increase over the next year given attractive credit markets?","Jay A. Brown","Sure, Kevin, I'll take that. You are right, we do have approximately $300 million a year of ground lease expense and I would divide that into basically 2 categories. One of the activities, which we've obviously spent enormous amount of time on in the 11,000 transactions that I've talked about thus far in securing the portfolio. In 2007, we were less than 20% owned in terms of sites and a much lower percentage of gross margin that was on site that we had greater than 30 years. So we both have focused virtually all of our activity on ground leases that have less than 20 years remaining on them. And that activity would have in it a component of a mark-to-market rate on those ground leases, whether we were purchasing them or extending the ground lease. And the purchases have largely offset any rental increase that we've seen from the ground leases as we've renewed them. I think the majority of that or a lot of that is through the system now and so most of the activity from this point forward and as we think about the future, the majority of the activity that we'll be doing will be purely a financial test around do we want the liability off balance sheet in the form of a ground lease because we're able to finance it at a lower cost with the landlord or do we prefer it on the balance sheet because we're able to achieve a lower cost of capital using our balance sheet to acquire the property? And I think more and more, as we go forward, we'll be thinking about our land purchases in that context and utilizing the lowest cost of capital to acquire them because we'll have already secured the land leases for such a long period of time. In terms of pace, I think you can expect for the next 4 to 5 years, we're probably going to continue at the pace that we're on. It has great operational benefits beyond the financial benefits to have long-term leases and improve the lease structure and own land. And so it's worth facilitating customers getting on sites and customers are making decisions about where to allocate their capital to make the quickest improvement in their network. We know that land ownership and long-term leases help that and so, I think there are some operational benefit to it. I think we'd probably stay on this pace for the next 4 to 5 years and then after that, it probably comes down and we're just purely making a financial decision.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital.","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 if I could. First of all, did I understand you to say that the WCP acquisition would be accretive to the growth rate or accretive to growth? And in general, can you talk about the relative appeal of land assets under other tower company towers versus under carrier towers? And just secondly, again, philosophically, wondering if you could comment on the sort of debate between what are more appealing acquisition candidate assets, towers that were originally built for carrier use or those who were purpose-built for Co-lo?","Jay A. Brown","On the first one, James, we believe it will be both accretive to ultimately AFFO per share which is how we evaluate everything. I think over time, you will also find that it will be accretive to our growth rate as we go through the process of applying the expertise that we have, that we complied to our own portfolio around extensions and purchasing the land. On a relative appeal standpoint, you've got to look at the underlying assets and the underlying towers and what the tenancy of those towers are and I would say, in terms of looking at that, that's one of the considerations that we make as we think about owning land of any third party towers is, who are the tenants installed on that tower's -- on the tower, as well as the location of the asset. It's not too dissimilar from the analysis that we've done under tower portfolios for a long period of time.","W. Benjamin Moreland","I would just add on the other activity around purchasing land under other people's towers. Obviously, we've done that now, in the WCP transaction as it will close. We've also seen public announcements where the Unison, the 2 large portfolios that were acquired over time by Unison have now traded to other tower companies. We are certainly comfortable owning land under other people's towers. We're sort of in the landlord business. That's what we do for a living and there's not much difference between whether you own the steel on the tower. Obviously, there's a revenue opportunity as we've certainly described our core business in terms of growth but at the right price, it's a financial transaction and to ultimately own and underwrite the value of that site through ownership of the ground and we certainly would expect to do that over time. Obviously, this one transaction puts us in that business. Others have made that decision already as I mentioned and we would expect to continue that as one of the many opportunities we have to allocate capital, but it will be purely on a discretionary, sort of pure financial decision to see what's the highest and best use of that capital. And I guess, James, your third question was on purpose-built towers?","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes.","Jay A. Brown","Would we prefer to own towers built by the carriers originally. And I think, James, this comes down to as we've seen over time, what ultimately determines the value of tower assets is the location and the need. And so, whether a carrier originally built it or it's built by a company whose out building spec towers, ultimately the value of those towers is determined by the location and the need. We've done incredibly well with towers that were originally built by Bell Atlantic Mobile and BellSouth and other carriers. We've also done very well with towers that we built a long time ago. So I think I wouldn't necessary draw a distinction in terms of preferring one over another. It just comes down to evaluating price, the location and then what we believe the demand would be. And as Ben mentioned earlier, at that point, once you've evaluated those things, and we're pretty disciplined on the price because we know we have an alternative, we can buy the towers that we already own in the form of share purchases or pursue a third-party tower opportunity.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm interested in just the -- you commented on the 4 national carriers. Any commentary on other carriers such as Clearwire in terms of the pace of leasing or I guess in Clearwire's case, amendments. And then with respect to the NextG growth targets over the next many years, was that an organic growth through just lease-up or was that through assets expansion?","Jay A. Brown","On the first question, Jon, our outlook for 2012 does not include hardly any benefits from folks like Clearwire or others that may have spectrum but not -- have not been deploying. And so as we get into calendar year 2012, we'll just have to see how some of those other carriers come. As I mentioned, virtually all of the growth that we've put in the outlook comes from Verizon, AT&T and Sprint.","W. Benjamin Moreland","We're certainly encouraged by what we see with Clearwire and as they do their 4G LTE overlay and then also prospectively go back and do some infill in markets, we have expectations hopefully that we'll see some activity from them later in the year. And then Jon, on NextG in terms of growth in the aspirational targets I threw out, obviously, that's a sort of a business case. So that assumes co-location on existing networks as well as growth with building additional networks that we would capture in the marketplace. So then there's a capital component that we're not going to get into on this call, it's too early to do that, but suffice it to say that the capital deployed in this business, not unlike the early days of the towers business, if you get it right and we think we will, based on our current experience already is that these come at very high returns far in excess of any kind of hurdle rates that you want to impose on it. And so hence, the reason we did the transaction. We think it's accretive to not only growth but accretive to value.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And as you make further investments in that business segment, is that going to be weighted more towards indoor or outdoor?","W. Benjamin Moreland","I think you'll see us do both. The indoor is very attractive but each individual one is pretty small. So you've got to do a lot of them obviously, to make a meaningful difference and we are doing a lot of them, and we'll continue to. I mean, virtually every sports arena or public venue and ultimately, class A office buildings, we think are ultimately going to have a shared wireless infrastructure component to them and we got a long way to go in America at getting that done. And there's room from other players beyond ourselves, obviously. And so as that market continues to develop, we will continue have a very active indoor presence but we will also pursue outdoor of zip codes as we call them, neighborhoods and urban centers and things that we've described. I think it's really a -- it's both. You'll have outdoor and indoor, both attempting to meet the same capacity challenge that's uniform out there.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then finally, internationally, if you could maybe give us an update on next generation broadband in Australia and how you feel about entering new international markets that some of your peers have been doing?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Yes, we are really pleased with Australia. It's too early to really see it much in the financial results but there's a lot going on right now down there. Not only the national broadband network that is sponsored by the government in terms of bringing broadband, fiber and wireless connectivity to essentially 100% of the population. So there's going to be leasing and build opportunities for us there. But there's also, for the very same reasons we see it here, renewed commitment on the part of the carriers to add capacity and improve networks in Australia. And I was just down there a couple of months ago and we have very high expectations. I won't put out a similar aspirational goal there that's in terms of guidance or anything but you should expect considerable more growth over the next 3 years than you've seen in the last 3 years in Australia and potentially, some investment opportunities down there as well. And it wouldn't surprise me at all to see us launch a DAS business in Australia. I think that's something that's going to make a lot of sense to us down the road. We will continue to evaluate other international markets. We've looked at a couple things and some friends in Western Europe recently. Don't really like what we see there in terms of the industry dynamics so much. We continue to believe the U.S. and the Australian market, which is almost identical to the U.S. in terms of market character, is the fastest-growing, most profitable market for the carriers and where the consumer demand for data demand, data is driving the capacity needs that's driving frankly, these businesses, our business in the U.S. And so, we think at the price that we see in the market today, this is the most attractive investment for us but others can have different views. We're going to continue to work on what we've got on our plate, and we're pretty excited about it.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Clay Moran with Benchmark Company.","Clayton F. Moran - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. One thing I didn't follow was how the land purchase enhances the AFFO growth rate. So if you could, Jay, maybe explain that again. And then over on NextG, could you just tell us what the current customer mix is? Maybe break it down by the national versus other and then what the 2011 revenue growth rate was.","Jay A. Brown","Sure, Clay, on your first question. As we have experienced in our own portfolio, as ground leases approach their term end date and you go to renegotiate those leases, you pay whatever is market as you enter into a new lease on the property. And so we evaluated the leases and our view is that there is an increase coming in the rental rates that are going to be paid underneath those ground leases. Thus, an increase in the growth rate.","W. Benjamin Moreland","On NextG, Clay, I'm not going get into specifically breaking out each individual revenue component of NextG. The early days of some of the networks were built in urban centers for some of the later rollouts, Metro PCS, Leap Wireless. The company today, NextG, does business with all of the major carriers in a significant way and we would expect that to grow materially over time with the lease-up opportunities that are resident for each of AT&T, Verizon and Sprint as well as new build opportunities for all of the major carriers including T-Mobile. So I think you'll see us a significant mix change. Today, it is not the majority of the revenue, it's not to the big 4, but over time, I think you'll see it change and probably flip such that the majority of the revenue going forward in my 5-year aspirational goal, I think it will look a lot more like the traditional tower portfolio that we have as the capacity needs are most acute in these large 4 carriers.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions. First on the DAS business, driving a little deeper here. I just want to understand maybe some of the non-cash elements relative to the traditional towers business. Also, I was under the impression that carriers contribute to the CapEx of the DAS system build-outs and wondering if that's accurate in terms of NextG's business. Separately, on the recent refresh on your credit facility, I was wondering if there were any net debt to leverage tests. I had read somewhere there was a 6x net debt to leverage test that dropped down to 5.5x in 2014. I didn't know if that was preliminary or just incorrect?","Jay A. Brown","Jonathan, I think on your first question, just to be really clear, we threw around a couple of numbers to span what's going into the NextG numbers. As we talk about what we think site rental gross margin of $50 million and then obviously, the G&A, that's all cash received. And so, the timing on that, I don't  if there's anything more to say about that, but it would continue in perpetuity. In terms of how the carriers pay for this and how we structure these, as Ben mentioned, similar to the tower portfolio, when a tenant comes to the site, oftentimes, they do make a contribution to the CapEx or subsidize the cost of expanding the network to hold them and over time, as this plays out and gets larger scale, we'll see how that goes. That's probably the 2, I will say there around pricing. Each system is different, but it's generally pretty similar to what you've seen historically in the tower business. I think specifically on the terms of the credit facility, we'll wait until that closes before I go into great detail about that. But it doesn't have an impact on changing our targeted leverage level of 4x to 6x as I talked about before and we would not expect to do anything that would limit our flexibility to be anything other than what we've had over the last 5 to 7 years as we structure the capital structure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just had a follow-up question on your outlook. I believe when you first provided 2012, you suggested that the activity you are seeing from Sprint at that time was included in the outlook and I think in 4Q, Sprint increased some activity and it's ongoing now. So is there a scenario where you could increase the outlook based on just coming from Sprint or is all of the MLA already accounted for? Also just one question on the straight-line impact that you guided for first Q. I think that goes up or is it a trend of deceleration? What will be a driver of that?","Jay A. Brown","Yes, on the first question if Sprint were to go out and lease more sites or do greater amounts of activity then we could see potentially, a change. One thing I would point out is that we saw the actual pickup in Sprint activity dating all the way back to the second quarter of 2011. So I think we saw it earlier than others did and the comments that are making -- that have been made more publicly recently are really commensurate with what -- a level of activity that we've seen 4, 6-plus months from Sprint. And so I don't -- as we've looked at our outlook and reaffirmed it for 2012, I don't think we've seen any of that. But to the extent that they were to change their plans or processes or deploy more sites, then we could potentially see the benefit of that in our outlook. When you're looking at the differences between the contribution of cash receipts and reported revenues, there's going to be some movement quarter to quarter just as leases renew a normal course. There's not anything significant that's happening in the first quarter relative to the past quarters. I think broadly, as you look at our revenue growth, our outlook for 2012, it's got revenue growth of approximately $85 million on a reported basis. And on a cash basis, that's going to be about $111 million. So growth on a cash basis is about 7%, roughly, but I think the ins and outs quarter-to-quarter, they're going to move just a little bit, but I think I'd step back and look at it over the course of the year and tell you I think that the amount of contributions from non-cash revenues is actually going to decline year-over-year to the tune of about $25 million as we near that crossover point in 2015, as I talked about in my comments.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one more question here around the DAS business. You talked about the work you've done with your land leases in order to secure long-term ownership or control under towers. You can't really own whatever would be considered land's rights of way in the DAS business, so what type of statistics can you provide with regards to what NextG has in terms of long-term access or exclusivities around the rights of way?","W. Benjamin Moreland","Brett, that's a great question. And it's one of the differences and I think, a favorable difference actually, DAS versus the tower work that we've done on the ground. To operate a DAS network in most jurisdictions, you're organized and have competitive local exchange carrier status, which gives you rights, certain contractual rights to access public rights of way and utility poles and easements. And so there's a established practice for what the pole attachment payments, or think of it as ground rent, are in those in markets and it's got to be consistently applied among really all users. For example, a cable company in a market. And so, it's a very sort of well trodden legal standard there of what gives us the access to those sites over a long period of time at very predictable expenses or payments. And so I don't think you have a circumstance here in the DAS business where you can be potentially, have the economics eroded over time because of what's happening on the ground, which obviously is a concern in the tower business and why we've spent the last 5 years working on the ground portfolio as we have. I really don't think you have that here. And in fact, a much more orderly and disciplined process of accessing the public right of way as a competitive local exchange carrier and we think that's pretty well established and a benefit of the business.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Are these agreements or these access to right of way, are they indefinite? Because a land lease, it might be 50 years, but still there's a termination on it?","W. Benjamin Moreland","No, these are definitely long term.","Jay A. Brown","Maybe, operator, we've gone past the hour, but maybe we'll take two more questions and then end.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I have 2 basic questions. Your margins were up a lot the last couple of years, but just looking at the FFO versus AMT, you're still a bit below those guys. Do you think there's much room for expansion over the longer term here and kind of what drives that. And then secondly, just listened to AT&T's conference call and their issues with spectrum and trying to move the networks over. Maybe at a high-level, what percentage of T and Verizon, what percentage of the spectrum do they own? Do you actually think they'd build out at this point? And they did mention shutting down a 3G network to free up capacity, spectrum capacity, how do you think that would play out and affect you?","Jay A. Brown","On your first question around margin, we would expect those to continue to go up in the absence of acquisition activity. As we've seen over time, we're  able to increase the margins that the gross -- site rental gross margin line just considering the growth in revenue against growth in expenses. Those have been rising at about 150 to 200 basis points per annum. As we go down to the AFFO level, we certainly don't expect that we'll lose any of that with regards to G&A or other expenses. And so I would expect you will continue to see those margins expand considerably over time. The one exception to that is obviously, if we buy an asset that has lower margins than the existing base, it will dilute some of that growth. But NextG being a good example of that, that would be \"dilutive\" short-term to the margins. But over time, we think it's actually margin and growth enhancing. So I think it will come down to the mix, and what do we -- how do we allocate capital, and what percentage of that ultimately gets allocated towards assets. But in a normal course, if you just think about organic leasing, I would expect those margins to continue to expand enough to enjoy the high incremental margins we've seen over the last several years.","W. Benjamin Moreland","With spectrum, I think the best way to handle your spectrum question is we're not in the habit of really commenting on specifically spectrum as it relates to individual customers. But I think broadly, as you think about our business, it's important to remember that there are spectrum challenges and constraints really in all of the carriers, whether it's a capital constraint on build-out or utilization constraint. And so it's -- they are constantly looking for a cost effective way to utilize the spectrum or reuse the spectrum through cell splitting to get more value out of that spectrum asset. And so I think you're going to continue to see more and more reuse of spectrum as we all continue to put more demands on the network and you'll probably see some -- obviously, the DAS component of that become meaningful overtime and other offloading strategies like Wi-Fi even in stationary locations. So I would not get into individually on, with respect to each customer's situation, but obviously, the capacity challenges that we're all placing on these networks is making it a significant burden on the carriers today. I think we've got time for one more, and I'll say up front I appreciate everybody hanging with us on the call for 1 hour and 20 minutes this morning.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just 2 real quick. So first, as we're thinking about internal growth for the company. It looks like 2011, I think you talked a little bit about the reasons why before, is a better year -- sorry, 2012 would be a better year than 2011? And how would you rate when you look at the numbers, what's going to come from upgrades versus actually new tower co-locations? Upgrades meaning amendments. And just a follow-up question on the AFFO definition and again, thanks for all that detail. Why wouldn't you subtract out preferred dividends just from the calculations, since that's a cost of financing that's used in your company more like debt than an equity dividend?","Jay A. Brown","Sure, Mike. On your first question, we do expect slightly better internal growth certainly on a cash basis in 2012. And I think most of that is related to the timing of the Sprint Network Vision. We've got about 6 months of that during 2011 and our outlook implies that we're going to have a full 12 months of that activity in 2012. So I think Sprint would be the main change if you're comparing those 2 years. And with regards to amendment activity versus new lease activity, if you're calculating it on a revenue basis, amendments continue to make up in the neighborhood of 70% of the total activity on a dollar basis. Obviously, if it was account basis, it would be greater than that, but on a dollar basis it's making up about 70% of the growth there. On your second question around preferred dividends, I guess I would say it's a bit of a moot point at this point because we've just converted our 6.25% preferred. So that's now gone. But honestly, the spirit of what we were doing was to simply take exactly what American Tower was doing and report our company on the exact same basis for comparability purposes. I think in the future, if we were to ever to do a security and had a similar cash dividend, then we could look at should the industry adjust the metric? And I'd be open to doing that, but the logic simply was, it was going away anyway and so I thought from a comparability standpoint, the best thing to do was just literally do exactly what our other peer was doing. And hopefully, that becomes the industry metric.","W. Benjamin Moreland","Mike, just to come back to your first question, just to add my 2 cents. I think it's January, still. So it's very early for us to be looking out for the year and see. But I think you can see beginnings of evidence that you could have more cell splitting in 2012 than you had in 2011. I don't know that that makes a material difference in our performance in any given year. Obviously, an activity, as you well know that starts in a year and carries forward, at best, you're only going to get a half year convention in that in your financial results. And so, we'll have to see, but ending run rate is always very important. And so we're very pleased with what we see for 2012. I want to thank everybody for bearing with us on this long-winded call today. We just felt like spending $1.5 billion since we last spoke to you deserved a little more explanation than 60 minutes would contain. So I appreciate you bearing with us. We're very excited for how we've positioned the company going forward. We've got a lot of work to do, and we look forward to speaking with you on the next call. Thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Crown Castle International Q4 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Son Nguyen. Please go ahead.","Son Nguyen","Thank you, Gina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our third quarter 2017 results. With me on the call this morning are Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investor section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.","This conference call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors section of the Company's SEC filings. Our statements are made as of today, October 19, 2017, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","In addition, today's call includes discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investor section of the Company's website at crowncastle.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Brown","Thanks, Son, and thank you everyone, for joining us on the call this morning.","As you saw from our press release yesterday, we continue to build on our track record of delivering great financial results with another strong quarter that exceeded our expectations. As Dan will discuss in further detail, our third results and 2018 outlook clearly demonstrate how strong our business is performing today and our expectation of positive trends will continue into 2018.","As a result of the sustainability and growth in our cash flow we\u2019re increasing our quarterly common stock dividend by a 11% per share reflecting our expectations of continued growth in 2018 and the anticipated contribution from the pending acquisition of Lightower which remains on track to close by year end.","As we look beyond 2018, we see a tremendous opportunity to leverage our unparallel portfolio of towers, small cells and fiber to deliver 7% to 8% long term annual growth and dividends per share by capitalizing on the attractive secular growth trends, driving demands for our leading portfolio of shared communications infrastructure assets.","To keep pace with the anticipated growth and data we expect significant investments by our customers across our towers, small cells and fiber for years to come. According to industry estimate mobile data is expected to grow nearly 40% annually through 2021 largely tied to 4G use cases including the continued adoption of high bandwidth application such as mobile video and the increasing number of connective devices. These trends further highlighted by the carriers recent moves to unwanted data plans in the U.S. which we believe are likely to result in our customer competing our network quality and speed.","Similar to the wireless industry, the expected 20% annual growth in wired data traffic is driving additional demand across our dense natural fiber asset. To meet this demand our strategy is to provide differentiated fiber solution that serve high bandwidth, multi location customers such as large enterprises, healthcare providers, educational institution and carriers.","This strategy allows us to enhance our competitive position in small cells by increasing the opportunities we serve with the underlying fiber assets, thereby improving the already attractive shared economic model we see in our small cell business.","Turning to the bigger picture, our portfolio of towers, small cells and fiber uniquely positions Crown Castle to take advantage of the investments our customers are making to augment their network. Our asset provides the mission critical infrastructure required for the ongoing shift to a world where mobile is the platform of choice for an ever more digital economy. This transition is impacting every industry and will serve to increase the long term value of our infrastructure asset.","We believe all of this expected investment activity will provide a long run way of growth, cash flow, sustained growth over across our portfolio of assets supporting our long term annual dividend growth target of 7% to 8%. To-date we\u2019ve underwritten our investments based on 4G and existing applications alone. But we believe there is more to come. This is similar to the late 1990s when we underwrote tower acquisitions assuming all these voice applications.","Overtime as the wireless used cases had expanded the infrastructure has played a vital role and our growth and returns have followed. We believe a sequel to that movie is coming. As we look further out the development of 5G has the potential to revolutionize how businesses in all industries operate and further extend a runway of growth across our infrastructure asset. We believe the faster data speed and lower latency powered by 5G will create new business models that are hard to imagine today.","Much in the same way that 10 years ago the iPhone and a transition from 3G to 4G dramatically changed the way consumers live and work. To-date mobile data traffic has been largely one way with end users primarily pulling data from the wireless network. As we look forward and consider the potential impact of the merging technology including virtual and augmented reality, autonomous and smart city applications to name just a few we believe these applications will likely drive additional data growth as the traffic becomes two way, exchange of across the wireless network.","As an example, Intel estimate set of single autonomous vehicle would generate approximately 4 terabytes of data per hour and a half of drive path. To put that into perspective that equals the same amount of data used by approximately a 1,000 mobile subscribers on a monthly basis.","The trend towards greater reliance on wireless network points to the need for carriers to continue to invest in hyper dense network that powers the small cells all connected by high capacity fiber. In advance of deploying 5G the architecture of wireless networks will continue to evolve as carriers preposition their networks to support new business models and applications towered by 5G.","Importantly our customers are making many of those investments today by augmenting their macro network with the deployment of fiber asset small cells and RAM to increase the capacity, efficiency and agility of their network as they meet their demand of a 4G world. As they evolve we believe the critical elements of the wireless network will continue to consist of towers which provide the critical foundation for coverage and capacity.","Small cells which are flowed traffic and bolstered capacity in areas of the network where data demand is the greater. And fiber which provides the connective tissue needed to create any integrated network of towers and small cells. With approximately 40, 000 towers, 50, 000 small cells on air who are under contract and more than 60,000 route miles of dense metro fiber performance for the Lightower acquisition.","Crown Castle is the only infrastructure provider in the U.S. that can provide these elements at scale. We have positioned the company for both what is needed now and for what we believe will be needed as wireless networks continue to densify the needs of coming data demand or other while creating value for our shareholders.","A significant driver of our shareholder value creation is our dividend. Over the last four years, we have tripled our dividends from an annualized $1.40 per share to the current $4.20 per share. Looking forward we remain confident if our ability to deliver on our stated goal, driving long term annual growth and dividends of 7% to 8% supported by expected growth and AFFO which when combined with our current yield offers a very compelling investment opportunity.","Over the last 20 years, we\u2019ve intentionally positioned our firm through thoughtful and disciplined investment to be at the leading edge of the deployment of wireless network. Our team has consistently made those strategic investments well in advance when the market opportunity had fully materialized. For example, as I mentioned before we began investing in towers in 1996 and have simply assembled our leading portfolio of towers across all of the top U.S. market. Well, it is compliant with those early investments to turn into the tower business we know today, the belief in the underlying fundamentals of the shared infrastructure model drove our team to make those investment decision. The same is true today of small cells where more recently we\u2019ve strategically built upon our expertise and shared wireless infrastructure to extend our capability to include small cells and fiber in 23 of the top 25 U.S. markets pro forma for the pending lightower acquisition.","As with the early tower investments, we started investing in small cells in advance of the market fully appreciating their importance and the development of networks starting with our acquisition of new path in 2010. Open away, our strategy is to grow our dividend by being a leading provider of the essential infrastructure needed to deploy wireless networks in the U.S. driven by our focus on meeting our customers\u2019 needs while positioning Crown Capital for the long term.","Since 2007 pursuing this strategy has resulted in us doubling our tower portfolio, developing a market leadership position in small cells and securing more than 60,000 route miles of high capacity, dense fiber in top U.S. markets. All the while growing our AFFO per share by 13% on an annualized basis returning approximately $6 billion to our shareholders in dividends and share purchases and delivering shareholders more than two times the total returns generated by the S&P 500 over that time period and I believe there is much more to come.","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan.","Daniel Schlanger","Thanks Jay, and good morning everyone. We\u2019ve a lot of good things to discuss today including our 2018 outlook. But I would like to start with an overview of third quarter results on slide 4.","Our third quarter results for site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA were at the high end of our previously provided third quarter 2017 outlook, while asset sale exceeded the high end of guidance driven in large part by the continued help and low keeping environment.","For AFFO, the quarter benefited from approximately $5 million lower than expected sustaining capital expenditures. This benefit was due to timing and we expect that capital will now be spent during the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the time use benefit we still would have exceeded the high end of our third quarter outlook for AFFO.","Moving onto investment activity, during the third quarter we invested approximately $288 million in capital expenditures consisting of $24 million of sustaining capital expenditures and approximately $264 million for discretionary investment opportunities including $24 million of land acquisition.","In July we raised approximately $7 billion of equity in debt capital which will impact full year 2017 results. As that capital is year marked upon the pending acquisition of Lightower which we expect to close by the end of this year. During the quarter we continued to return significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly common stock dividend of $386 million in the aggregate or $0.95 per share.","Turning to slide five, our updated full year 2017 outlook reflects the out-performance during the third quarter and a modest increase in leasing expectations during the fourth quarter offset by expected higher repair and maintenance expenses driven by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Jose. The increase in repair and maintenance expense from these three hurricanes is primarily related to having crews on standby in preparation for the storms as well as inspection, debris removal and responding to customers following the hurricanes.","I want to thank all of our employees who have worked tirelessly in the wake of these natural disasters to help get our customers assets back on online. During through very stressful times they went above and beyond the call of duty and I'm proud to work at a company with employees like ours. Importantly though our assets did not sustain significant damage and we do not anticipate additional impact from those hurricanes subsequent to the fourth quarter 2017. Given these puts and takes and adjusting to exclude the impact of the Lightower financings our full year 2017 outlook for AFFO and AFFO per share remains unchanged from our previous guidance of $ 1.826 billion and $4.99 per share respectively.","Turning to slide six, our full year 2018 outlook highlights include 10% growth in AFFO per share from a 2017 figure of $4.99 per share which exclude the impact of the Lightower financings, the $5.50 per share in 2018 and a 11% increase to our dividends from an annualized $3.80 per share to an annualized $4.20 per share demonstrating our confidence in the organic growth of our business in the expected accretion in the pending acquisition of Lightower and an acceleration of new leasing activity during 2018.","Focusing on these specifics as shown on slide seven, our expectations for growth and site rental revenues of approximately $1.044 billion at the midpoint is driven by approximately $205 million of organic contribution to site rental revenues plus the full year contribution of Lightower an additional half year from the Wilcon. Approximately $205 million of organic contribution site rental revenues is comprised of new leasing activity of approximate $205 million compared to approximately $172 million in 2017. The expected acceleration includes new leasing activity in 2018 of approximately $110 million for towers up from $105 million in 2017. $55 million for small cells up from $40 million in 2017 and $45 million for fiber solutions up from $25 million in 2017.","In addition to new leasing activity, organic growth is also supported by annual contracted tenant escalators which we expect will contribute approximately $85 million in growth during 2018 in line with 2017. Growth from tenant escalation is offset by tenant non-renewal of approximately $85 million which is slightly lower than what we expect in 2017 to arrive at an organic growth of approximately $205 million up from approximately $166 million in 2017.","Change in straight line adjustment is expected to remain consistent with 2017 offsetting organic contribution to site rental revenues by approximately $55 million in 2018. We have not included any contribution from the FirstNet as part of our 2018 outlook. We are however optimistic about the FirstNet rollout and recognize there is additional growth potential once the deployment begins.","Turning to slide eight, I would like you to the expected AFFO of approximately $460 million at the midpoint of outlook from 2017 to 2018. Similar to site rental revenues Lightower is expected to be a significant contributor to AFFO growth in 2019 adding approximately $345 million to AFFO meta-finance. Starting on the left organic contribution to site rental revenues growth at the midpoint of $205 million is partially offset by $65 million increase in operating and G&A expense. Beyond the typical cost escalations in the business this increase is primarily related to the additional staff we've added throughout 2017 to support growth at our small cell business including investments related to increasing annual node production as we work through our robust backlog of nodes to be brought on air through 2019. A significant portion of the increased headcount will be in place as we exit 2017.","Continuing on contribution to network services is expected to be in line with 2017 and finally 2018 AFFO growth is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million on a net basis of other items. These items include changes in cash interest expense, sustaining capital expenditures, and contribution from acquisitions that closed in 2017. We expect to generate 10% growth in AFFO per share in 2018 based on the midpoint of our initial guidance after excluding the impact of the Lightower financings in 2017. As we previously mentioned with the significant opportunities ahead and based on our expectations for 2018 including the contribution from Lightower we've increased our quarterly dividend by 11% per share further adding to our track record of dividend growth.","Returning capital to shareholders through a growing dividend aligns well with our business profile defined by high-quality in growing long-term recurring cash flows. To wrap up we remain confident that our shared communication infrastructure portfolio is well-positioned to generate significant growth of the long-term as our strategy aligns with where the market is today and where we believe it is headed in future while at the same time allowing us to return significant capital to our shareholders through dividends.","Our visibility in the near-term fundamental and positioning over the long-term give us confidence in our ability to grow AFFO, return capital to shareholders and invest in the future all while we deliver on our target long-term dividend growth rate of 7% to 8% per year over the coming years. With that Gina, I would like to open the call to questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instruction] And we will take our first question from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping we can try and spend a little more time on packing the outlook you have for organic leasing activity in 2018, it sounds like your towers is going to be pretty stable but you're expecting a step up on the small cell side. So I was hoping you could maybe help us understand what's giving you the visibility into that and then just on the quarter itself I am curious how much of the growth in the small cell business, how much is the organic growth was coming from fiber, you had already deployed. So you're getting more revenue on existing fiber versus how much that was deployed in the new fiber? Thanks.","Jay Brown","So on the first one Brett, to your comment in each of the three areas that we talked ABOUT both towers, small cells and fiber we expect the contribution from new revenue growth to be higher in 2018 than it was in 2017. Towers is up about 5% from about 105 million to 110 million, small cells is up from about 40 million to 55 million and then fiber, fiber solutions is up 25 to 45. So we are seeing that growth across the board in each of the three areas where we are selling communications space on communication asset.","To your second question I think I would point to the comments that made recently which would reflect the entire pipeline of small cells. This would be true in the quarter as well as true in our outlook for 18 that we expect about 70% of the activity that we are seeing on small cell to be anchored builds and we would describe that as building new fiber to cover geographic range plus the accretion for Lightower and we are were pretty, we think the Lightower deal is going to close by the end of the year and so we are confident and not wanted to declare the dividend based on that. But I think it's both a gift and part of Lightower though to answer your first question. On the second question on FirstNet, I don't get specifically into any one customer what we assumed in the growth but we did not in the 2018 outlook that we did not put in anything from assuming that with any deployment of FirstNet obviously we\u2019ve read and had conversations about what that will likely look like over time but at this point we don't have enough visibility to really put it into our 2018 numbers to the extent we had develops as we get into the course of 18 we will happy to update the outlook based on it.","David Barden","Thanks Jay and if I could just ask one follow-up so I know that you guys when you guide to the churn for the metro, I believe clear wire you kind of look at the \u2013 you go to the worst possible case in terms of tearing down sites immediately and the highest revenue sites first but obviously given general conversations that we've been hearing and reported in the market has there been any change in activity level and decommissioning in that portfolio of towers that you have been able to detect?","Jay Brown","You are right, and in fact to say, we\u2019ve talked about churn over the years. We have always put in kind of the book end and think about it and talk about at the book end ultimately what's realized tends to be less than that bookend of the worst case scenario. As we would think about 2018 our outlook would assume basically what we have visibility to and still some of the worst case if everything comes down. Our experiences has been it's not as significant as the bookend assuming that everything comes down but I would tell you based on kind of when we talk big picture about 7% to 8% growth in dividends over the long-term we try to be balanced in that view. So a part of that balancing is what's going to happen with churn and we assume kind of the worst case scenario in that longer term view and then our short term view we will adjust that based on what we actually earned from the carriers as we get closer to those conversations.","David Barden","Okay. Thanks Jay.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery","Thank you very much. Good morning. Maybe you can just touch on the current small cell activity just I know sometimes you give us some examples of co-location activity, the tenants per node and so forth. Any color you could give us about sort of the operational performance this quarter would be great? And then on Lightower, any more color on what you need to do to get this closed this right, going to right at year end or might be earlier the map?","Jay Brown","On the first question, small cell activity is continuing to deliver what we expected, obviously as you can see from the step to 18 we think the activity level is going to increase in 18, the teams are working at those nodes on air and based on how we\u2019ve been able to align the operations, you\u2019re seeing the step in the results in 18 as a result of the operating capabilities of the team.","The other thing I would point to is some of the case studies that we talked to when we did the Lightower acquisition on the call, we\u2019re see those return dynamics continue to play out for the assets that we\u2019ve owned for a long period of time and the densest markets in the U.S. those are continuing to see healthy leasing activity at a rate that\u2019s about twice a level of lease out that we\u2019ve seen historically in the tower business so we\u2019ve continued to see that play out. And then from a return standpoint, the returns continue to be very attractive initial yields in the 6% to 7% with anchor build and then as we add additional tenants the returns move into the teams and beyond as we lease up beyond that and that\u2019s been the operating performance that\u2019s continued to remain in the quarter.","On Lightower we\u2019re far enough along in terms approvals as we go through federal and state approvals that were required on the transaction to be confident that at this point that we will be able to close it before we get to the end of the year. We\u2019re obviously working as hard as we can to close it as quickly as we can and to the extent that we clear all of the hurdles we will give you an update when we clear those hurdles as to the exact timing. But for now we\u2019re confident we will have it closed by the time we get to January 1st which is why we included in the outlook.","Simon Flannery","On the guidance any concerns around some of the California obviously you just beat the infrastructure \u2013 is that any hindrance here or do you think you can still work with what the current status there?","Jay Brown","We will be able to work with the current status there, so it doesn\u2019t give us any concerns about our ability to deliver on the timelines that we provided.","Simon Flannery","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Niknam from Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Niknam","Hi guys, thank you for taking the questions. Just two if I could, one of the competitive front around small cells, I know in the past you talked about pretty strong win rates, just curious whether you have seen any change in terms of competitive dynamics there.","And then secondly, more broadly I guess around fiber, if you could maybe shed some more light particularly around how those segments and some of the various recent acquisitions are operating on just sort of a new structure within Crown Castle. And wondering maybe if you can give us a little more color on the real step up you expect in fiber from 25 million to 45 million within your guidance? Thanks.","Jay Brown","Sure. On the win rates for small cells they continue to about what we believe is about half of the total activities that\u2019s going in the market which is consistent to the last few quarters at least maybe the last year or so. And we continue to see some more market dynamics in terms of the carrier self performing some portion of that building around fiber and prices. And then us winning about half of those opportunities, we continue to believe based on the market dynamics that the prices where the infrastructure can be shared that\u2019s the most cost effective model and that continues to be playing out in our win rate.","On the fiber segment I would describe that as, our base to fiber has gotten larger and so our growth in revenue has continued to increase product mix again as I mentioned in my comments still focused on large enterprises, educational facilities, healthcare providers where we\u2019re doing multi-location and a high capacity of bandwidth that\u2019s required. As we\u2019ve increased the asset base and grown the number of miles of fiber that we have we\u2019re increasing the revenue associated.","Daniel Schlanger","And generally this is performing very much in-line with what we expected when we did the acquisitions. So this is \u2013 the outlook that we provided for 2018 is much to what we would have expected at this point.","Matthew Niknam","Got it, thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin","Thanks. So Jay you spent a lot of time talking about 5G and a number of the used cases and bandwidth required and so forth and I wonder perhaps does it make sense to talk a little bit about [Paper IO] in that context and kind of your thoughts around that investment and activity? Thank you.","Jay Brown","Paper IO is a company that provides many datacenters at the edge of the network which is an important component of \u2013 in a 5G of reducing the latency, we made a relatively small investment last year in paper that as in early stage of deployment. We\u2019ve used them in a number of trials that we\u2019ve done with more hard traditional customers as well as other customers that we believe will likely be meaningful customers to us overtime. I would describe that as an opportunity that we think will leverage our real estate assets over a long period of time, the tower sites that we have today, we believe will likely be hubs environment in a sea ran environment and those tower, our towers will become increasingly important as the market develops towards sea ran in a 5G environment. So it's more of a trial small investment that gives us an opportunity to get some insight into the way people are thinking about the importance of moving computing power to the very edge of the network.","Jonathan Atkin","So how soon do you think it might be, is it quarter, years or just no comment at this point in terms of when you might start to utilize your will assets and monetize them in that type of manner?","Jay Brown","I would describe it in the broad broadest sense, our aim over time is to gain as much revenue and cash flow off of the assets that we own and as I described in my comments we believe towers are important to that, small cells are important to that and fiber is the connective tissue that connects both towers and small cells and we are looking at every opportunity we can to drive revenue growth and cash flow growth across those assets. Some of the things that we look are near term that we are comfortable underwriting investments based on.","As I mentioned in my comments we underwrote all of the investments that we made based on 4G applications and what we currently see consumers using today but we also have a view that there's more than just current applications to come. I would describe mobile edge computing as one of the areas that we believe has the potential to provide upsides to our revenue cash flow growth as well as returns and extends the runway of growth from the infrastructure over a long period of time. So it's just one of many opportunities that are \u2013 that is directly tied as I mentioned in my comments to the deployment of 5G. So if not near-term it's not going to show up in the 18 and likely probably not 19 results. It's a longer dated activity that we are keeping our eye on and positioning ourselves to benefit from.","Jonathan Atkin","And on small cell is there any way you kind of ballpark these increments?","Jay Brown","Jon, you are breaking up for your question. Can you ask it again?","Daniel Schlanger","Hi Gina, let's move onto the next question and then we can put John back in the queue.","Operator","Okay. Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks very much and good morning folks. Two questions if I may, if we think about the sort of the site listing activity of a macro side I mean it seems like you're continually see healthy activity levels you have obviously mentioned that FirstNet is not included in your outlook. Can you talk to us about what type of initiatives you're seeing from the operators at the moment that's giving you sort of that improved activity levels at this point. I know you can't talk about carrier specific initiatives but just holistically is this a reaction to some of the unlimited data plan that we seen in the marketplace. Any color on that would be helpful?","Jay Brown","We are seeing each of the carriers work on increasing both the capacity of the network and speed of the networks so we are seeing combination of new co-locations where they are densifying the network through self splitting as well as going back on sites that are already on and amending their existing installations to provide additional spectrum band in some cases or additional capacity in the network. So it's similar to what we seen in the past just frankly more of it.","Amir Rozwadowski","That's very helpful and then if we can shift gears over to the fiber and small cell side clearly you guys have bolstered your fiber footprint and that's driving additional growth initiatives going forward. How do we think about sort of your current fiber footprint, I mean if we think Jay about sort of how you are thinking about the longer-term evolution owning this sort of connectivity tissue, there does seem to be other areas where you could potentially bolster the footprint in order to position the company for that longer-term densification initiatives? Are there thought process about other inorganic activities building additional fiber? How should we think about sort of those initiatives going forward?","Jay Brown","Couple of things I would say about that Amir. First of all the pipeline that we have in the notes to be constructed in some cases we are building additional fiber. The vast majority of that fiber build as I mentioned in my earlier comments about 70% of the total notes relate to places where we are building additional fiber. That additional fiber build is primarily in those top 25 markets in the U.S. so we are getting a more dense portfolio of assets in the top 25 markets primarily from what we are constructing in terms of fiber.","On the inorganic side Lightower is obviously a very sizable transaction and it's going to take us some time to digest that and integrate it into the portfolio so you should look for us to do anything of scale in the near term as we focus on integrating that asset and beginning to expand the returns on the assets as we articulated when we did it. We certainly believe there are significant revenue synergies across both sets of assets both the fiber that we bring to the transaction that has not been utilized to its fullest opportunity for fiber solutions as well as the fiber that they bring to the two companies where they've not been utilized to the fullest extent from the small cell side. So we see revenue synergies there and we are going to be focused on gaining those revenue synergies because we think it's the best way to drive the returns on the assets over a long period of time. So over time we may turn our eyes back towards looking at opportunities to acquire assets. Those will need to go through the same filter that we put Lightower and FiberNet and will call other transactions through but we got a believe that over the long term it has the ability to increase and grow our dividend and be additive to our growth rate and that the assets have the opportunity to add significant small cells on them in order to drive those returns.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks very much for the incremental color.","Operator","And we will take the next question from Philip Cusick from JP Morgan. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to get more color on the piecing of the revenue for each of the segments for the growth in towers, small cells and fire solutions should be steady through the year or is it more backend loaded and they might differ by category?","Jay Brown","Richard they are similar to pass the business is backend loaded if you go through the course of these any year. So roughly probably about 55% 60% of the growth would be in the second half of the year and about 40% to 45% would be in the first half of the year. Obviously the results as they play out you bet only speaking to the small incremental change so if you think about \u2013 if you did it in totality the year is pretty evenly loaded but if you're just looking at the incremental growth you would see someone in the neighborhood of about 55% to 60% of the incremental growth in the back half of the year.","Daniel Schlanger","And that's already baked into how we provided the outlook. So we think that we are on EBITDA and AFFO and takes that to the next.","Unidentified Analyst","And then on the churn side it looks like the non-acquired node churns are going to be higher this year that just of getting back to a normal level of activity now that the acquired node churn is gone or is there something else going on there?","Jay Brown","I think the churn is flat basically on a nominal basis which on a bigger base of business is actually lower year-over-year. So we are seeing that the churn profile is what we would expect it to be on towers and small cells for the non-consolidation portion of our churn.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it and then final question that escalated the dollar numbers pretty much the same year-over-year but masterpieces is bigger is that because the asset base of some of the acquisitions don't have escalators and or is there something else going on there that the escalator is actually coming down for other parts of the business.","Jay Brown","No the escalator is not coming down. It's going consistently what has been historically. There is a portion of it where we had a holistic MLA roll off in 16 that had a lot over effect that so it continued in the 17 and therefore did come down a little bit in the 18 but that was already understood I think by everybody in part of what is the normal escalator is now what we think going forward but you're right there is some portion of it were we are bringing in businesses that don't typically have escalators on the fiber solutions which as we add that revenue and pull down at our percentage basis but we are seeing very similar trends in pricing and the escalator in the core business and then towers and small cell side.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson.","Nick Del Deo","Hey thanks for taking my questions. First can you quantify your expectations for changes in the amortization prepaid rents in 18 versus 17 and how much can that contributes to your 2018 recent forecast by segment?","Jay Brown","The prepaid rent is going to be in the neighborhood of growth the same way it was from 16 to 17, so it's consistent and so we think the trends that we laid out in terms of the new leasing activities across towers and small cell and fiber are very representative of what is whether you include or I exclude the prepaid rent the way we think about it thought that it's all cash. It just depends on when we get that cash. And so we are making investments over the long-term that are generating good cash on cash return which is the way we think about business. So we think that those the numbers that I talked about earlier in terms of new leasing activity or what we think are the new leasing growth in the business.","Daniel Schlanger","And as the reason is not stepping up because the small cell installs are kind of backend loaded or only start when the side is tuned on the air.","Jay Brown","What you said is turn but I would say that reason is not increasing. I think that overall the business it is increasing just not anything that would change the trajectory or the growth that we talked about.","Nick Del Deo","Maybe one more if I can, if I remember correctly, in your Q1 call you said it was your expectation that most of your small cell backlog would get turned up in the second half of 18 with some fall in the 2019, does that remain the case or has it been pushed back some? I might be reading too much into it but in some of your earlier comment you seem to have suggested your small cell growth in 2018 is more functional of the words than you got in 2016 not necessarily 2017?","Jay Brown","Yes Nick, I think when we talked about the big step up earlier this year, we said it was 2019 not 2018. We thought it as being as being a 2019 event. So our view on timing of when we will turn these nodes on has not changed from we thought about previously, we are seeing obviously an increase in small cell revenue growth that's the function of what we want in 2016 which was a step up from the activity that we saw in 2015.","Nick Del Deo","Okay. Got it. Thanks for your color.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company. ","Colby Synesael","Thank you. Two questions if I may, the first question I was hoping if you could provide some color on 2018 discretionary CapEx and if so you are able to break out what's coming from Lightower versus the standalone business? And then secondly you are spending $20 million to $40 million in 18 on integration. I was wondering give you a little bit of color on what's being done, have each of the \u2013 you have done a lot of fiber acquisition over the last year. Is your intention now to from the technical perspectives integrate those so for example combining billing systems, combining the OSS just talk about what's been done thus far and what the intention is 2018 would be helpful? Thank you.","Jay Brown","Sure Colby. Discretionary CapEx we anticipate that the discretionary CapEx in Lightower is around what has historically been $300 million range. The business will be a step up from 17 because of the big growth in the small cells that we are putting on air. So we anticipate overall discretionary CapEx to be up $200 million to $300 million I would say, 18 over 17.","Colby Synesael","I am sorry. So that sounds $300 million for Lightower in that \u2013","Jay Brown","And then on a base business another 200 or 300 because of the small cell that we are putting on air. On the integration what we are planning on doing is integrating all of the fiber solutions companies we have bought recently into the new operating structure that we announced not too long ago with Jim Young and we would anticipate trying to put it all on a platform and same operating platform and management style and the timing of that happening is still unclear because we haven't got into we haven't closed on Lightower to have enough of those conversations but the overall goal is to run that as one business that we can get the most out of the expertise that we got with the Lightower team along with the expertise we already have in place and then providing asset base across the US as oppose to pockets but we think there will be a lot of revenue synergy that we can get from putting all those things together which is Jay was talking about earlier was really the driver behind Lightower transaction, get access to the fiber and then drive additional revenue across that fiber.","Colby Synesael","So the $20 million to $40 million will go towards that in 2018 but in terms of when that project actually gets completed and we start to see the synergies whether it's revenue or OpEx that's still PBD?","Jay Brown","Well, to be clear we have not announced any synergies on the OpEx side, but the revenue synergies will be to be determined. They are not baked into our outlook so we didn't put these small cell on Lightowers fiber but we put any revenues synergies on the fiber outside of light tower footprint. ","Colby Synesael","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer.","Timothy Horan","Thanks guys. On the pricing on small cell and fiber is that a change or is that been fairly consistent over the last couple years are you seeing any improvements there?","Jay Brown","Tim the pricing on both small cell and fiber tuition is consistent with what we've seen in past years.","Timothy Horan","Great and how about for carrier demand? I think it has been a little bit concentrated in the past in terms of the carriers over the point of small cells. Is that pretty broad's spread out at this point?","Jay Brown","We have seen the demand across all of the carriers and what I would describe as maybe a change from the past has been the market they have focused on prior to the conversation that we started having at the beginning of this year where we saw significant increase in the number of nodes that we were getting from carriers I would have described the vast majority of our activity coming close to probably 90% of the activity occurring in the top 10 markets in the U.S. and really focus on the top five market specifically. And what we've seen over the last 12 months is that has moved outside of the top 5 - 10 markets to the top 25 market. So the increase in volume has followed with multiple carriers, but really function of the number of markets that are being focused on and the overall quantum of nodes being deployed.","Timothy Horan","Great and then lastly it looks like soft bank is looking to partner into the U.S. market wireless infrastructure market. Do you think there is an opportunity for you guys to partner with them? Do you see them as kind of being more competitive going forward?","Jay Brown","I think there is, we are always open to having partnership conversation with folks and I saw their announcement earlier this week and I think it affirms the great returns that are in our business so I am not surprised that a firm like Linley would desire to come into the U.S. market given the returns that we've been able to demonstrate over a long period of time and further and so I think they find the returns and opportunities per capital to work is attractive and that's why they are willing to put funds into it. So not surprising and would be open to have a partnership conversation if they wanted to.","Timothy Horan","Thank you. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Rollins from Citi.","Michael Rollins","Hi thanks for taking the questions. First if you get us help level set so if you take the midpoint of your organic growth guidance for 2018 can you split that percentage growth rate and help us with what the comparable tower number would be versus the small cell fiber growth rate and then I will follow-up with the second question if I could.","Daniel Schlanger","So Mike I think what we try to do given the new leasing activity we will split it up. So $205 million new leasing activity and we said we are going to it's about $110 million from towers, about $55 million from small cells and about $45 million from fiber and that should give you a pretty good sense of where we are overall and those \u2013 like Jay was mentioning earlier those have each increased over 2017 so we see increasing growth across each of our businesses.","Michael Rollins","Right so what would be \u2013","Jay Brown","I think we would say Mike maybe one of the way to think about it is we've increased the organic leasing activity on a consolidated basis that's up several \u2013 that's up about 40 basis points about 1% over 2017 activity that we saw is organic leasing going to 6% in 2018. It was unchanged in 2017.","Michael Rollins","Right. So we and if you take that \u2013 is that six the total business so if you wanted to look at towers as a growth rate and small cells as a growth rate what would comparative be for those two pieces?","Daniel Schlanger","Yes so small cells is growing as we talked about in the high teens percentages year-over-year and towers is still in the 5% to 6% range as it has been growing a little bit but like Jay was mentioning a lot of that because the base of the business and towers is so much of the base that in order for the whole thing to growth hat much towers has to be accelerating on top.","Michael Rollins","Okay. So five to six is the range for towers to think about for 2018?","Daniel Schlanger","Sure.","Michael Rollins","And just a follow-up when we look at the revenue bridge that you provide there's a difference in the way that you look at new leasing for towers versus new leasing for small cells in that towers my understanding is you don't include the builder suits, but in fiber you are including the builder suits what would the growth rate in fiber look like if you didn't include the builder suits?","Daniel Schlanger","As going back to what Jay was talking about earlier, about 70% of what we are building in small cells and fiber is anchor builds and we anticipate those are for both current growth and in future growth to come but as we put on more and more of these nodes and get more and more co-locations a lot of it will come through that 30% of co-location. It's just the bigger numbers are also including the bigger anchor built. So the number would be lower if we didn't include the 70%. We just look at it as this is part of our business going forward. This is part of what we are doing and it's really not part of the business of the towers to build the suit at this point. So it's just a difference in how we think about the business. There are small cell businesses in the investment and growth phase and we are including both the capital in the revenues associated with that.","Michael Rollins","Well, last question when you are selling co-location whether it's in tower or small cells what percentage of the deals are bundling the two services together versus kind of like ala carte search rings. Is there a measure we should be tracking on that basis?","Daniel Schlanger","Mike the folks at the carriers are looking at the use of both macro side and small cell. So it's the same group inside of the carrier. So when we are having conversations with them there is a conversation about both. When you get down to when things actually get signed and done, the nature of those two it's very different. So from a small cell standpoint, there is a significant amount of RF engineering and design that goes into how our carriers utilize those assets. There is far less of that on a traditional tower site where it's leasing at in essence of a spot on the map. So the conversations are happening with the same people at the carriers. I wouldn't describe it as a bundling because it's not a cookie-cutter solution on the small cell side. So we got to have a more robust conversation regarding small cell than we need to have on the tower side.","Michael Rollins","Thanks very much. ","Operator","And we will take the next question from Walter Piecyk from BTIG.","Walter Piecyk","Thanks. So I am just going to go back to couple of earlier answers, did you say when the deal closes there will be or won't be an incremental dividend increase?","Daniel Schlanger","There will not be.","Walter Piecyk","Got it. Thank you. And then on the prepaid rent as far as looking 2018 similar growth rates if you look at 2017 it looks like you are pacing at 18% growth so based on your prepaid grow 18% in 2018 that's in, I guess what you would consider reported organic growth so for excluding \u2013","Daniel Schlanger","So the prepaid rent is running by similar dollar amount from 17 to 18 than it did from 16 to 17.","Walter Piecyk","Similar dollar amount, 240 right that\u2019s fine but -- so if you are aiming up at 240 for prepaid for the year then you are looking like 280 for 2018.","Daniel Schlanger","We take this conversation offline and have it where we can talk about numbers more specifically as to we can make sure that the question you are asking is being answered appropriately. It's hard to follow all the numbers you are trying to get to in this type of form. Can we just talk about it after the call?","Walter Piecyk","It just relates to the growth rates you guys are talking about as far you\u2019re going, but okay. ","Daniel Schlanger","I am not trying to -- question if you really wanted to be answered here it's just really hard to follow 240 I don't know what you are talking about so if you like we can go \u2013","Walter Piecyk","These are numbers you report whatever I can go with it offline and it's in your press release but whatever. I guess just give us an update on any of the trial that you have talked in the past from nontraditional wireless providers? How is it going how they proceed, how they ended and if you think that they can contribute anything to revenue in 2018?","Daniel Schlanger","Yes we will talk on the trials we have done. I would describe this is more \u2013 they are opportunities for us to learn and understand how the networks are being deployed, I made the comments earlier about edge computing and some of things that we have done with Safer and other components of the real estate we have done some of those with fiber. As we have done those they are designed more to learn. They are generally relatively small in terms of dollar amount so they are not going to affect our 2018 results. They're much more of learning opportunities for us to understand how the market is developing and what's going to be necessary in C ran 5G and as we get into things like Internet of Things and all the connected devices.","Walter Piecyk","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS.","Batya Levi","Thank you. One question on the pipeline for the small cell node build, do you had mentioned that you had about 25,000 in the beginning of the year for the next 18 to 24 months. How does that figure look right now and if we get the federal regulatory for month attachment do you think that you can beat the delivery of the pipeline?","Jay Brown","Yes, the pipeline is up and we continue to win new nodes. It's not a meaningful step so as we think about the G&A as Dan mentioned in his comments around the cost structure we think we sized the cost structure to be able to handle the level of activity to the extent that we see a step up meaningfully from where we are currently. We will come back and give you an update on that.","Second question was around the federal legislation speeding up of time. With the federal legislation and frankly even the state legislation is helpful is it gives clarity of the outcome. Small cell towers are forever going to have the necessity of us working closely with the local municipality to work through planning and zoning and requirements. So we don't anticipate over the long period of time that the legislative experts are going to meaningfully speed up the activity but they will give greater clarity to both the municipality to the carriers then to ourselves as an infrastructure provider of the path of deploying that infrastructure. So to the extent we see federal legislation and we are working towards that or state legislation I think it gives greater clarity but I wouldn't necessarily guide you to assume that our timeline where we talked about two years to get nodes on air that gets shorten meaningfully. If after the facts that it does we will come back and update you on that but our working assumption is that the two-year time frame is likely to be about what it's going to be even if we do get new legislation.","Batya Levi","Got it and one follow-up on the new leasing activity. 190 to 200 million that you laid out that 220 laid out that also organic based. Correct but it doesn't include new growth coming from Lightower. Okay.","Daniel Schlanger","That's true. All the Lightower are held on to the right in the acquisition chart.","Batya Levi","And in terms of your expectations for Lightower next year can you give us a sense of in terms of the mainly the activity growth versus churn how you expect the transition to show up next year?","Daniel Schlanger","Yes so what we talked about when we talked about the transaction to begin with is light tower has grown the revenue in the high single digits per year and since we anticipate that to continue and if the churn rates will be included in that and those have also been in the high single digits on a percentage basis so those remain in line with what we continue to believe.","Batya Levi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Spencer Kurn from New Street Research.","Spencer Kurn","Hey guys thanks. I wanted to talk about your small cell backlogs. So you have been aggressively rolling out fiber, but it seems like two of your main customers have also been making more meaningful push throughout their own fiber this year. Have the dynamic shifted, have we typed any shift in dynamics of your sort of pipeline in the future or how do you sort of see both of these dynamics playing out over the next several years?","Daniel Schlanger","Spencer we haven't seen any change in the dynamic. What we have seen is the change in the quantum of activity which is up meaningfully in 2017 from what we have seen in past years. Our win rate has remained about the same winning about half of the activity in the market. I continue to believe that you're going to see the carriers self perform some portion of the deployment of small cells and fiber and the network. I think we will see other providers of shared infrastructure model in the market that will provide some portion of that activity and then we certainly expect to continue to provide a meaningful portion of it.","Similar to what we seen on towers where there is tower builds or small cells I think in the places where the shared infrastructure model is available and makes sense from a return standpoint you'll see provider such as ourselves going to put capital in because of the economics and the returns of it being shared. There are going to be other places though where there may not be a shared model. We may not have an interest in participating in it and in those places I think you're likely to see some other unlikely self performed by the carriers where fiber is going to be needed and we just we can't justify the economics and the likely returns there and so we don't participate.","Spencer Kurn","Got it.","Jay Brown","Go ahead Spence.","Daniel Schlanger","Wrap it up. You can wrap it up sir.","Jay Brown","We have time for one more question.","Jay Brown","Spencer you have one more we will take \u2013 if you had a follow-up go ahead.","Spencer Kurn","I just wanted to \u2013 sorry I just clarify the so the message is either your carrier customers I guess aren't where you're there, doesn\u2019t sound like they are deploying fiber in similar markets and then also even though you are capturing 50% of win rate today, that might go down but the overall magnitude of volume is so great that even if you're losing share modestly your backlog should still continue to ramp for next couple of years.","Daniel Schlanger","Yes, I think with regards to the market themselves some of the markets are the same. They just may not be in the same areas of those markets. So we could be in same markets, it's not in the same area inside of the market and longer term based on where we believe the world is going I think that total number of small cells to be deployed and therefore the fiber to be required very well could result in our win rate coming down over time but the actual amount of activity that we have in front of us in the revenue growth is associated with that could continue to increase even though our win rate is coming down.","So I believe the number of small cells that are going to be needed in the market as we move towards the 5G environment are significant enough that they are going to need to be multiple different providers in the market in order to provide the kind of capital required to do that.","Spencer Kurn","Got it thanks again.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Brandon Nispel from Keybanc Capital Markets.","Brandon Nispel"," Hey thanks for squeezing me in. I guess in the market where you have the small cell systems in place what's the ratio that you are seeing in terms of number of small cells to macro towers today and where do you think that could go in one to two year period. And then on the CapEx that you guys called out in the first quarter I think it was $1.2 billion, can you remind us where you are in that build process and how many route miles of fiber you're planning on building? Thanks.","Daniel Schlanger","On the first question it would be very, very small the ratio of small cells to tower. What we typically see and so it's not something that that we would look at Brandon may be a better way to think about it is if we think about building about a mile of fiber we will see roughly 2 small cell, 2 to 2.5 small cell per mile of fiber. It's about the density of small cells that they are deploying across the market is a pretty good guess of that but if you would take the quantum of towers in marketing and compare that to the small cells it would be highly weighted towards towers.","Daniel Schlanger","On the 1.2 billion what we're talking about on that is we \u2013 so now we had an addition of about 25,000 nodes to our pipeline. It was going to take about $1.2 billion to get those on air like Jay said, I was going to 2019 that is part of the increase in capital that we are discussing earlier from 2017 to 18. We believe we will still have some of that to spend in 2019 but we are in the midst of spending that money currently.","Jay Brown","I would like to thank everyday for joining the call this morning. Obviously we are excited about how the business is performing and certainly optimistic as we go into 2018 based on things increased revenue activity across all of our businesses and then lastly I just like to echo something that Dan mentioned earlier in the call I would really like to express my appreciation to our employees who have worked incredibly hard over the last, through the last couple of months dealing with some really significant hurricanes. They have done a terrific job delivering for customers and we certainly appreciate how hard they have worked hard to get networks back on air and to maintain the assets. So, thanks to all our folks, thanks everybody for joining this morning.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Son Nguyen, VP Finance and IR. Please go ahead, sir.","Son Nguyen","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results. With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland, Crown Castle\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown, Crown Castle\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors sections of the company\u2019s SEC filings.","Our statements are made as of today January 28, 2016, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. In addition, today\u2019s call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the Supplemental Information package in the Investors section of the company\u2019s website at crowncastle.com.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Brown","Thanks, Son, and good morning everyone. As you saw from our release yesterday, the fourth quarter was another great quarter, bringing 2015 to a strong close and positioning us to raise our full-year 2016 outlook.","For the full-year 2015, AFFO per share of $4.30 was up 8%, compared to 2014. And our increased midpoint for full-year 2016 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.68 represents a 9% increase compared to 2015. In addition, to delivering great results and extending our track record of execution, 2015 was marked by several significant accomplishments.","During 2015 we achieved an investment grade credit ratings from each of S&P and Fitch Ratings. Also during the year, we redeployed capital from the divestiture of our former Australian subsidiary to further grow and strengthen our leadership position in wireless infrastructure in the U.S. which we believe is the most attractive market for wireless investment.","Today with our portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers and 16,000 miles of fiber supported small cell deployment, we are able to provide wireless carriers comprehensive solutions across the country as they continue to upgrade and enhance their networks to the increasing demand for mobile data.","Shifting to the fourth quarter results in Slide 4, site rental revenue grew 9% year-over-year from $723 million to $785 million, an increase of $62 million. The $62 million increase is comprised of $49 million of organic site rental revenue growth, less $17 million in adjustments for straight-line accounting associated with contracted fixed rate tenant escalation, plus $30 million in contributions from acquisitions, which primarily consisted of Sunesys and other adjustment. The organic site rental revenue growth of $49 million represents growth of 7% year-over-year, comprised of approximately 10% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalation, net of approximately 3% from tenant non-renewals.","Moving to Slide 5, our fourth quarter results for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided fourth quarter 2015 outlook.","Turning to investment activities as shown on Slide 6, during the fourth quarter we invested $251 million in capital expenditures, of which $29 million was sustaining capital expenditures and $222 million was discretionary investment. Included in our discretionary investments is approximately $23 million for land purchases.","Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business, as we seek to control our largest operating expense and produce stable and growing cash flow over time.","Today, three quarters of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own, or control for more than 20 years. Where we have ground leases, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years. Of the remaining discretionary investment, we invested a $199 million in revenue-generating capital expenditures, consisting of $90 million on existing sites and $109 million on the construction of new sites, primarily small cell construction activity.","Small cells continue to perform ahead of expectation and currently generate 12% of total site rental revenues and 11% of total site rental gross margin. Excluding the benefit from our recent acquisition of Sunesys, small cell site rental revenues grew approximately 30% year-over-year. Today our small cell networks consist of approximately 17,000 nodes on or under construction, supported by 16,000 miles of fiber. Of the 17,000 nodes, approximately 12,000 of the nodes are on air with the other, approximately 5,000 nodes under construction and expected to be completed over the next 12 months to 24 months.","Continuing on the financing activities, during the quarter we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share or $295 million in the aggregate.","For the full-year 2016, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend in aggregate of $3.345 per common share. Additionally, in January we closed from a $5.5 billion Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Proceeds from the New Facility, together with cash on hand, were used to repay our previous Senior Secured Credit Facility.","As of January 26, we had $1.6 billion of availability under our five-year revolver. As a result of the refinancing our senior unsecured notes were upgraded by S&P to investment grade. Even more impactful than lowering the cost of debt we believe that an investment grade capital structure will ultimately drive down our cost of equity. Equally as important, we believe having access to a deeper pool of capital will result in a more stable, long-term cash flows and increase flexibility to pursue discretionary growth opportunity.","Moving on to the full-year 2016 on Slide 7, we have increased our expectations at the midpoint for site rental revenues by $10 million, site rental gross margins by $7 million, and adjusted EBITDA by $12 million and AFFO by a $11 million. The increase in the outlook reflects the strong results from the fourth quarter, our continuing belief that 2016 leasing activity will be similar to 2015 and the timing benefit related to tenant non-renewals occurring later than previously expected.","It is important to note that our overall expectations for the number of tenant non-renewals and aggregates, has remained unchanged. For more detailed information regarding our current book of contracted tenant leases including our expectations for non-renewals, those are available in our supplemental information package.","At the AFFO per share line, the updated midpoint of our full-year 2016 outlook resulted 9% growth year-over-year compared to 2015, increasing from $4.30 per share to $4.68 per share. Like 2015, 2016 is shaping up to be another great year. We believe the essential elements for long-term shareholder value creation are as attractive as they\u2019ve ever been. We continue to see stable and consistent leasing activity from our carrier customers. We have a runway of attractive discretionary investment opportunities, primarily in the form of small cells to enhance and grow our business. And we have an opportunity to manage the cost of debt and lower the cost of equity as we transition to an investment grade balance sheet. All of this gives us confidence in maintaining our long-term goal of delivering AFFO per share and dividend per share growth of 6% to 7% on an annual basis.","Before turning the call over to Ben, I\u2019d like to take just a moment to discuss the announced succession plan. I\u2019m honored and excited to have the opportunity to lead the Crown Castle team. I have had the privilege of working with Ben over the last 17 years and he has been a great friend and mentor to me. Over the last eight years, through Ben\u2019s leadership as CEO, we have grown the business significantly. Increasing AFFO per share from $1.66 to $4.30, and have successfully doubled the size of our tower portfolio, established ourselves as the leader in small cell and strengthened our balance sheet, positioning us better than ever to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead.","I will benefit greatly in my new roles, I\u2019m being surrounded by a very talented and experienced executive team that has been instrumental in all of these accomplishments. Together with the rest of the Crown Castle Team, we are looking forward to continuing to execute on our strategy of driving long-term shareholder returns through disciplined capital allocation, dividend growth and delivering for our customers.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ben.","Ben Moreland","Thanks, Jay, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning, extra early. I\u2019ll touch on our succession plan in a moment. First, I\u2019d like to comment on 2015 results and what lies ahead. In short we had a great year, exceeding our expectations throughout the year and executing on strategic actions through the sale of our Australian subsidiary and the purchase of the Sunesys fiber assets that really sets us up well to win in the future. I want to thank my colleagues at Crown Castle for their hard work in delivering on our commitments in 2015.","Now on to the future. As Jay just mentioned, we believe we have the essential elements for long-term shareholder value creation are as attractive as ever. I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes to further elaborate on Jay\u2019s comments regarding each of these elements. These included a continued, healthy and sustained leasing environment over the next several years, a long runway of investment opportunities that we expect will drive high quality long-term growth and all the while maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing risk appropriately to drive down the cost of capital.","First on leasing, we believe that we\u2019re in the midst of a multi-year wireless investment cycle that will result in same level of leasing activity similar to what we have experienced in 2014 and 2015, and that is what we expect to see in 2016. For 2016, we\u2019re expecting approximately $170 in new leasing activity, of which \u2013 $115 million will come from tower leasing. The $115 million in tower leasing represents the space of adding approximately one tenant equivalent over a 10-year period on our 40,000 towers, or a tenth of a tenant per year per tower, which is approximately our average pace of annual leasing over the last seven years.","Importantly, through those seven years, we\u2019ve been through a number of different macro economic cycles and covered several different wireless investment cycles in terms of technology, level of engagement by carrier customers in different environments. Given the underlying long-term perspective \u2013 positive fundamentals from the continued increase in mobile data consumption, we believe that this pace of leasing is a reasonable expectation for our future growth.","Industry research projects mobile data to increase seven-fold between 2014 and 2019 a compounded annual growth rate of 47% or roughly doubling every two years. Recently some of the wireless carriers have reported mobile data growth even higher in the range of 60% to 75% per year growth during 2015. Against this backdrop, we expect the carriers to continue to invest on a consistent basis to maintain and improve network quality, which is the competitive necessity as carriers seek to retain existing customers, attract new customers, and monetize their networks through the deployment \u2013 development of new revenue streams such as over-the-top video and telematics.","As a shared wireless infrastructure provider, Crown Castle stands ready to assist wireless carriers in this endeavor by providing them with quick and cost effective access to our wireless infrastructure as they seek to upgrade and enhance their networks.","With our tower portfolio and small cell expertise, we have the unique capability to deliver across all means of shared infrastructure to meet the network needs of our carrier customers. Additionally, the runway for our growth is further supported by the amount of spectrum, but is expected to be deployed over the next several years, including the spectrum from last year\u2019s AWS-3 auction, the spectrum from this year\u2019s anticipated broadcast incentive auction and the spectrum currently held by the carriers and others such as a DISH and FirstNet.","Turning to capital allocation, when we evaluate various investment alternatives we have whether its small cell share purchases or acquisitions, our goal is to drive long-term growth in AFFO per share and dividend per share. By this measure we are very excited by our recent and ongoing investment in small cells. Today our $3 billion investment in small cells generates a yield of approximately 8%, inclusive of our initial $1 billion investment in NextG, the acquisition we did in 2012 with an initial yield of approximately 3% to 4% and our continued Greenfield investments.","We are underwriting new small cell builds with anticipated initial yields of 6% to 8% on the anchor tenant, where we believe we have the opportunity to drive yields higher through co-location. But the second tenant expected to achieve a low-to-mid teens yields and the expectation of further yield accretion, when we add third and fourth tenant overtime.","On this point, in addition to the anchor tenant, we are seeing strong co-location demand on our small cell networks. We have focused our small cell efforts in the top 25 markets and believe that these early systems will be some of the most attractive locations in the future, given their franchise value.","Just like towers, the need for network densification is driving small cell growth. Given the challenges in the carrier space and bringing more capacity to many urban and suburban geographies, we need to get closer to the subscribers and focus on reusing spectrum more efficiently, carriers returning to small cells as a critical tool to improve their networks. With a very similar business and economic model as our tower business, we see a long runway of attractive investment opportunities in small cells.","Shifting to the balance sheet and risk profile, we view our dividend as a growing annuity paid to shareholders, where we effectively pass through the cash flows we generate from providing the U.S. wireless carriers access to mission critical infrastructure. Our goal is to protect and grow the dividend stream overtime.","Our dividend is supported by long-term, recurring, contracted leases that we have in place, which currently represent approximately $20 billion in future contracted rent payments, plus future growth from contracted rent escalators and a continuing wireless investments being made that I previously mentioned. From this foundation, we are focused on managing, financial and operating risk, as we allocate capital and grow the business.","On the balance sheet side, we believe in maintaining an investment grade balance sheet should provide us with access to a deeper and more stable pool of capital, reducing risk through our cash flows and providing us with an increased flexibility to pursue potential investment opportunities, both of which are supportive of the secure and growing dividend. This same perspective drives our capital allocation decisions as we continue to believe that the U.S. market provides us with the most attractive, risk adjusted return opportunities.","Bottom line with a sustained level of leasing that we expect to continue over the next several years, the small cell opportunities we see ahead of us, the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our business. We believe we can continue to deliver 6% to 7% AFFO per share and dividend growth per share. Further, we believe our expected growth rate combined with our current dividend yield of approximately 4.3%, represents a very attractive long-term total return profile for share holders.","Finally, I\u2019d like to speak to our CEO succession plan that we announced last night. I began contemplating this and subsequently engaged the board in this conversation sometime ago after reflecting on a number of considerations that led me to conclude that 2016 was the right time to begin this transition.","First, as we\u2019ve discussed on this call, the company is incredibly well-positioned for this transition. Having accomplished a number of strategic objectives that I believe are important to set us up for the next generation, and market leadership and value creation. Including on this list \u2013 included on this list would be the assemblage of our unrivalled tower portfolio, the sale of our Australian business, the acquisition of Sunesys, and leadership in the exciting small cell arena, and the strengthened balance sheet, with the achievement of the investment grade rating late last year.","Second, Jay is ready, ready to step up. We\u2019ve worked together for 17 years since the early days of Crown Castle and he has been an integral part of all we have accomplished. He has the trust and respect of the board, the executive team, and the organization, as well as the investment community. I\u2019m very fortunate to have him as a successor and have absolute confidence that he is the right leader to lead the organization into this next chapter of success. Most importantly though, Jay will be leading a team of seasoned professionals who are very good at executing for customers across all our assets, both towers and small cells.","Finally, on a personal level, it\u2019s been an unbelievable privilege to lead Crown as CEO these last eight years. I have always found it valuable from time to time to push myself out of my comfort zone in search of new challenges. Many years ago, I lost my dad to a heart attack when he was only 47. In 2014, my wife had a breast cancer scare and fortunate was caught early and through surgery has resulted in a full recovery.","With our kids out of the house now our once structured lives have changed. It is with all these considerations and the reminder that life is short, that I sense this is the right time to initiate this move out of my comfort zone. I look forward to pursuing many new challenges, some personal and some professional. I also look forward to my continuing investment and involvement with Crown Castle in this new capacity, ensuring leadership continuity as Executive Vice Chairman. I am proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished and through the succession plan, I\u2019m highly confident this team will continue to reward shareholders, customers and employees for choosing Crown Castle.","Thank you to all of you on this call who have supported me and this management team over the years. I look forward to our continued association. And with that operator, I\u2019d be happy to turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from David Barden with Bank of America.","David Barden","Hey guys, thanks Ben. You know this is not the last quarter we\u2019re going to chance to talk, but thanks for all that and the contributions. And Jay congrats on the job. I\u2019m looking forward to continue to work with both of you guys. Kind of focusing on the business is the kind of look ahead I guess I\u2019ve got a couple of questions. One just on the obvious, with respect to kind of all the noise coming out of Sprint with respect to their network architecture, we don\u2019t have to talk about Sprint necessarily as to say, there\u2019s a carrier out there that\u2019s looking to explore new more efficient ways to build a network and it seems that they are looking to reevaluate their renewal schedule on tower leases as we go forward. I was wondering if you can kind of talk about, what if anything you see ahead for that strategy.","And then second, Jay a year ago, we were sitting here and I think the outlook was for new site leasing activity of maybe 5% and now we\u2019re sitting here looking at actually 6%, a better outlook for this year over the course of last year that outlook actually went up by about a percentage point. So what are the factors that you see, maybe evolving in 2016 that could do to this year\u2019s guidance, what happened to last year\u2019s guidance in terms of walking it up the curve over the course of the year? Thanks.","Ben Moreland","Sure Dave, hi this is Ben. First of all, without addressing Sprint specifically what I\u2019d like to talk about is the fact that, three of the four carriers have reported thus far and I think all of them in various ways have confirmed the need for macro sites being an integral part of their network now and in future, and that shouldn\u2019t be surprising any of us that are close to the business.","Macro sites i.e. towers remain the most attractive and cost effective way to cover a given geography with the spectrum that they own. That said, there are certainly hybrid sites and head net [ph] architectures that we participate in and many people do. That are going to augment the capacity of the networks going forward and that\u2019s the whole small cell underlay approach. And frankly sites that look like crosses between macro sites and small cells, dark fiber fed and ultimately that sort of what CRAN architecture starts to look like overtime.","When you think about our business fundamentally, it\u2019s a capital intensive business. Goes with the lowest cost of capital, tend to win and when you introduced on top of that the notion of shared economics i.e. the carriers only pay for the proportion of the asset that they need. It\u2019s an incredibly compelling model and it\u2019s one that, I think, is going to continue to work as it has for the last 20 years for the indefinite future.","So when carriers work on new deployments and new architectures with certainly an appropriate view to save cost, we\u2019re going to be right there with them at every step of the way. And I can tell you that we\u2019re working with all four carriers in that regard to utilize our cost of capital and the sharing model to be an integral part of their solution going forward. And so I think it\u2019s been helpful for the last couple of weeks that three out of four carriers have confirmed that macro tower sites are an integral part of their model going forward. That\u2019s not surprising to us. But I think this hybrid-type network going forward, is going to be very important and we\u2019re incredibly well positioned with assets and capability to take advantage of that.","But when you hear us talk about the cost of capital, it\u2019s not simply just to lower the cost on the balance sheet, of our interest expense, it is very much to the most competitive company out there that can deploy capital assets on behalf of these carriers and make it very efficiently for them. And so that\u2019s something we\u2019re spending a lot of time on it, and executive team and I\u2019m very comfortable with what we see in front of us.","Jay Brown","Dave and your second question, last year the 2015 increase in guidance over the course of the year about half of that was driven from an increase in leasing activity and about half of that was driven from lower non-renewals than what we had expected going into the year. And as we look at our guidance for 2016, we held that elevated level of leasing activities throughout the full calendar year 2016 such that leasing activity, we think this year will match that of 2015.","As there are potential upside there, I\u2019d point to the fact that typically in the business we have about six months to eight months of visibility \u2013 from the time we have an application coming from a carrier to the time it\u2019s actually revenue producing. So we have a real good idea as to where new tenant leasing is going to be through at least the first half of the year or maybe dead-end of the third quarter.","So to the extent that there was additional leasing activity over the course of year, that\u2019s honestly more likely to impact our run rates going into 2017 then it is to be that meaningful to result in 2016.","David Barden","Got it. All right, thank you very much guys.","Operator","We go next to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.","Ric Prentiss","Thanks, good morning guys. First I like all the comments congrats to Jay and Ben it\u2019s been a great ride long time together in the tower space for us and looking back at my notes, I think Crown is up 4X since 17 years ago. So congrats to both of you guys.","Ben Moreland","Thank you. ","Jay Brown","Thanks. ","Ric Prentiss","First question, I\u2019ve got is if a carrier does decide not to renew their lease, what triggers there? And do they have to remove the equipment and how much could that cost?","Ben Moreland","Hence on the contract Ric, typically our contracts require them to remove the equipment and restore site, what we and we\u2019ve gone through that many times with these non-renewals, that Jay has talked about and we\u2019ve experienced with the next [indiscernible]. What we\u2019ve often done though is essentially negotiate a final payment if you will, what was commonly referred to in the industry as pay and walk fee and that could be anywhere from sort of $30,000 to $50,000 per site depending on what\u2019s out there and the negotiations, but that\u2019s generally what occurs. And so more often than not we\u2019ll negotiate a final payment, that\u2019s typically the market convention.","Ric Prentiss","Makes sense. Also this quarter we saw a pop-up in the SG&A line, can you talk a little bit about what is occurring there and can we think of that maybe as a revenue driver longer-term?","Jay Brown","Yes, the SG&A pop-up, a bit of that would be related to having Sunesys for all three months of the quarter Ric. And then the other part of it the business outperformed our bonus level for across the employee base for the full-year 2015 would have been above kind of our targeted level as we raised outlook throughout the course of the year and delivered and even exceed it in the fourth quarter. I think if you look at calendar year 2016, we think the run rate is basically unchanged from full-year 2015. So as we talked about on previous call, we think that there\u2019s virtually no cost increase at the GAAP line on the tower side or on the SG&A side for calendar year 2016, and that would be based on the current level of activity that we see in small cells, ex cetera.","We\u2019ll obviously have some operating costs in small cells as we deployed brand new systems. But for most part on the tower side we think costs are flat and on the SG&A we think those costs are flat in 2016 to 2015.","Ric Prentiss","That make sense. And then on Sunesys, you\u2019d talked in the past about some extension maybe that could be done half of those existing fiber that Sunesys brought in. Update us a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in that extension mode?","Ben Moreland","Sure. The rationale behind the 10,000 miles of fiber providing great bargains are Sunesys it would give is a great head start on small cell deployments and that\u2019s exactly what it is. But it\u2019s a head start, it\u2019s not a perfect footprint and so as you referenced, we\u2019re constantly working to improve that our network, just as we do with existing Crown fiber, where we get a new engagement and maybe there\u2019s, as I\u2019ve described before there\u2019s always overlap.","So when you think of a tower co-location which is 100% co-location on existing site, co-location or an additional deployment on a Sunesys piece of fiber, or Crown fiber is always a hybrid. So there\u2019s always a percentage of overlap and a percentage of new typically. But in examples may be otherwise like Manhattan where there was pretty full overlap. So that\u2019s working well. It drives our increasing created yield on the asset.","As I mentioned in my remarks we\u2019re up to about 8% on the embedded capital like to date. And so as we\u2019re building additional, either additional laterals or accommodating co-locations, it\u2019s essentially driving up that yield overtime. And we\u2019re going to have better metrics for you in the coming quarters because I know this has got a lot of moving parts to it. And we\u2019re going to come out with that for everyone to help their modeling later in the year.","What we focus on as a management team is ultimately the yield on the invested capital. That cuts through all the metrics whether it\u2019s tenants per node, or nodes per mile, or revenue per mile. And so we\u2019re going to help everybody with that later in the year so that we can all be clear, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re giving you these sort of run rate yields, it\u2019s validating for ourselves as well that we\u2019re continuing to see accretive investments in that space.","Ric Prentiss","Great, thanks guys. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs [ph].","Brett Feldman","Thanks, and also congrats to you guys, really exciting news. As we think about where you\u2019re deploying capital, you sort of listed a couple of potential areas of discretionary investment. I might have missed it but I don\u2019t think you actually include towers on the list. I\u2019m curious whether you feel like the portfolio towers that you have today is essentially the portfolio you\u2019ll be operating and generating returns off of for the foreseeable future.","And then just as an extension you talked about the importance of small cells and how you\u2019ve invested in that. And as you see your carriers kind of evolve, how they\u2019re thinking about deploying venture networks, do you feel like the outdoor business that you have in the top 25 markets today is really what you need or do you see opportunities to create partnerships or make investments in other areas to further accelerate your positioning in that market? Thanks.","Ben Moreland","Sure, Brett. First of all, I didn\u2019t mean to slide towers at all. We bought 17,000 sites in the last, I guess, three years that we\u2019re looking for more tenants. So those towers we acquired from AT&T and T-Mobile most recently are very attractive co-location candidates. And probably, not probably absolutely represent the biggest value creation opportunity we have in the company. That is to co-locate on an existing tower and we\u2019re quite happy with that going forward.","The fact is that the carriers had essentially sold the vast majority of their site. There\u2019s some small portfolios out there. And it has been somewhat aggregated by the three large carry tower companies. So I don\u2019t see anything large on the horizon out there. It\u2019s certainly not a requirement for us to create significant value as I mentioned the organic growth is what drives value around here.","But I would also highlight, go back to 2001 and, 2000 and 1999, when essentially the carriers sold all their sites initially and then we went through a whole another wave of that some 15 years later. So we do think there\u2019ll be a need for more tower sites overtime as cell sites continue to shrink and density requirements continue to increase. There\u2019s nothing significant out there today and we are certainly advancing our leadership position on this newer architecture around small cells as we talked about.","On the outdoor business for small cells, while we are about 90% focused in the top 25 markets, we\u2019re constantly looking at opportunities outside the 25 markets. And so your question, I think, goes to sort of how big could this be? And the answer is, we don\u2019t really know, but it looks like it could be sort of a whole another tower business. It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s expensive, it takes a long time to build these systems, but at the same time we are focused on what we think our franchise locations in something of a land grab that reminds us a lot of the early days of the tower business and so we\u2019re focusing our efforts in the top 25 markets, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be limited to that. In fact I know it\u2019s not, because we\u2019re looking at opportunities occasionally outside those markets and looks like it\u2019s got a long, long runway.","Brett Feldman","And that\u2019s primarily outdoor opportunities, I mean it just seems like there\u2019s a lot different types of small cell solutions, there\u2019s indoor solutions and rooftops, and I\u2019m just wondering whether those areas are peaking your interest as well?","Ben Moreland","Well we have an indoor business and we do quite well with it, where we choose to play we\u2019ve done a lot of sports arenas, things like that. I think overtime you\u2019re going to see multi tenant office buildings, but there are alternative solutions available to the landlords and tenants, when you get into a multi tenant facility, that don\u2019t necessarily lend themselves to a neutral host owner like ourselves. A tenant in an office building can set up their own system or an office building can own their system, there\u2019s lot of different variations. And then there\u2019s a limitation in the marketplace still as to what the carriers will ultimately elect to pay for in terms of the rent.","As we\u2019ve said forever and we all know this, there\u2019s more need in the market for densification and network and there are hours in the day or capital that the carriers can invest. So there\u2019s a rational prioritization going on. I think you\u2019re certainly seeing this extend to healthcare facilities now. And so we\u2019re certainly looking at the indoor building business where there when we find it attractive. But it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as large as the outdoor business.","Brett Feldman","Okay. Thanks for that color.","Ben Moreland","Okay.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Michael Rollins with Citi","Michael Rollins","Good morning and thanks to ask the questions, two if I could. Your first observation that you add more nodes on to relatively flat amount of fiber mile, is that a trend that should continue and how does that affect your return on capital opportunity from that business overtime?","And then secondly, I\u2019m curious what you\u2019re seeing on the propagation side for small cells? And how would you compare the radius of a small cell in your expense versus the macro? And are there changes in technology that\u2019s going to affect the relationship over time? Thanks.","Ben Moreland","On your first question Mike, you are pointing out a good observation there. You\u2019re right, miles of fiber were relatively flat and we added nodes against those fibers miles which is exactly colocation. I mean that\u2019s the business we are in and why we\u2019re interested and like the tower business and why we like the small cell business. You have an asset investment against which you add additional recurring revenue and that drives the long-term yield on that invested capital. And that\u2019s the model we\u2019re seeing play out. As Ben and I referenced in our comments, we\u2019ve seen really attractive lease-up [ph] activity on the fiber that we own today and that\u2019s driving additional nodes against set number of miles of fiber. We\u2019re going to see that as well as continue into make investment as we build new systems and that\u2019s the driver of our activity at the moment.","On the second question, the propagation characteristics of small cells, there\u2019s no simple answer to that question or one-size-fits-all answer to that question. Its designed based on what the carriers desire. And so you can go into a given area and find a small cell every 200 yards where they are trying to increase the density of their network. At other places you\u2019ll see them spaced a little further than that. So there\u2019s no easy answer to say that the propagation of a small cell, it has to do with what spectrum may deploy across that small cell, how much power they use. So it can vary. I would say in a typical urban environment, you\u2019re going to cover about a block to two blocks of area when you deploy \u2013 when the carriers deploy small cells. And we\u2019ll see them put up nodes about every other block would be a relatively normal deployment in a dense urban area.","If you look across the entire portfolio on an outdoor basis where we\u2019re typically when we\u2019re building a new system for someone, we\u2019ll be somewhere between 2 nodes and 2.5 nodes per mile of fiber on the initial deployment. So that gives you some idea of what we see and obviously there can be some pretty wide swings depending on whether or not we\u2019re doing central business district or doing something a little bit outside of the most densely populated areas of the city.","Michael Rollins","Thanks very much.","Ben Moreland","Okay.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Richard Joe","Hi, this is Richard Joe for Phil. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit more on a small cells, we wanted to get a sense of the competition is like small cells, how many RFPs are competitive and how is the pricing held up?","Ben Moreland","Yes, hi Richard it\u2019s Ben. It\u2019s very competitive and look we\u2019re the leader in the space and we believe we have more capability for what we turn key deployments which all in building systems locating antennas on fiber that we build. But at the same time, there are other very capable competitors out there and we see competition in the marketplace. It goes back to my original comments about cost to capital matters in this business. And so that\u2019s something that we focus on.","Not going to get really into the specifics around the market, a lot of these systems are conducted through an RFP process initially, but at the same time what matters most to carriers obviously is the ability of the award winner to execute. And so we have seen opportunities come back to us on occasion, where the awardee may have had some challenges in the market. What matters most to carriers if they have a need for small cells is execution, meeting your milestones, getting on the air, so that they can accomplish the capacity enhancements that they are trying to do on their network.","So I think it\u2019s [indiscernible] I will say on that, it\u2019s a highly competitive market these days.","Richard Joe","Great. And then a quick follow-up in terms of your guidance, should we think of this small cell business just ramping through the year or is this going to be more back-end loaded as the bills kind pile up, so to speak.","Jay Brown","On both the towers and small cell side the year is the bit back-end loaded, it\u2019s about 40% of the activity in the first half of the year and about 60% in the second half of the year.","Richard Joe","Great, thank you.","Jay Brown","You bet.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jonathan Atkin, RBC.","Jonathan Atkin","Yes, so I have a question about the push out of the non-renewals and wondering which projects that refers to is it WiMax, or iDEN or one of two CDMA decommissions that\u2019s been happening? And then just generally kind of your macro tower business, wondering what new developments are seen in your pipeline as it pertains to things like AWS-3, overlays or macro site densification or any and then I guess I have a quick follow-up on small cells. Thanks.","Ben Moreland","Yes. On the first question, the push at around churn, we hesitate to comment specifically on what carriers are doing. I think I\u2019ll pass on that, it comes from several sources John, its not one single source and we updated actually probably have seen in the supplement our expectation for churn for the next several years and that\u2019s in aggregate. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re seeing anything at this point I would point out is changing our overall view of the non-renewals. I think we\u2019ve been pretty specific in the past about the amount of consolidation churn in non-renewals and what was driving that. And our underlying assumptions are basically intact for that today.","The second question on the tower side, we\u2019re seeing carriers do all kinds of things on the macro side. There\u2019s been simplification [ph] activities there\u2019s amendment that\u2019s adding new technology, they\u2019re supporting additional spectrum that we\u2019ve seen and the mix of both amendments and new cell and brand new cell sites in 2016 is pretty similar to what we saw in 2015. So we\u2019re not seeing any trends here that I would point to it as changes from what we saw in 2015.","Jay Brown","Just to add to that. John, just real quick to add that as we\u2019ve pursued the small cell business we\u2019ve talked about on this call and remain very enthusiastic about the opportunity, again the first thing a carrier does is add densification, is macro tower sites. And everywhere we\u2019re building small cells there are macro tower coverages already there. So if you were to stand on the street corner where we have a deployment, you would already have a macro site covering, keyword covering that geography. And so we\u2019re building small cell networks essentially and underlay approach in to add capacity to these networks. But certainly the macro tower site is what happens first and that\u2019s continuing to be what we see on the tower side.","Jonathan Atkin","And then I guess segwaying into the small cell is there a different as of demand that are seen in terms of which carriers are coming on to your infrastructure? And then I guess related to that and related to what Mike was asking as well, is the nodes you expect to have this year, how much would be kind of a long existing fiber routes that have been activated with your infrastructure second or third tenancies if you will along the same route versus new laterals that haven\u2019t been activated with your data infrastructure?","Ben Moreland","Go ahead, Jay.","Jay Brown","I was to about say on the first question, when we go into any given year there\u2019s an expectation we have around ranges for each of the carriers. And I wouldn\u2019t point to anything in calendar year 2016 that looks that much different than what we saw in 2015. We\u2019re seeing activity on both the macro side, as well as small cells from all four of the operators. We saw that throughout 2015 and we would expect the same thing in 2016.","On the mix of leasing in small cells, it\u2019s about a 75% mix of where we\u2019re deploying brand new systems in places that we did not previously have small cell systems and about of the leasing activity would be coming from co-locations on existing systems.","Jonathan Atkin","And then finally on the CFO search, any particular criteria that you are looking for in terms of the background of the individual you\u2019re looking to hire?","Ben Moreland","Well based on some initial conversations, I think we can attract extremely seasoned and qualified candidates that we\u2019re very optimistic there this spring, having a great new addition to the team and more to come on that.","Jonathan Atkin","Thanks, good luck.","Ben Moreland","Thanks, John.","Operator","We will take our next question from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much, and good morning. Simply want to echo the comments Ben, wish you the best of luck as you look to make, what I suspect we all, hope will be an exciting transition for you and your family.","Ben Moreland","Thanks.","Amir Rozwadowski","In terms of questions, I\u2019ve two, if I may. On the first, you mentioned some of the upcoming spectrum that seems to be coming to market I mean obviously there have been selected carriers who\u2019ve talked about the opportunity set in terms of providing additional bandwidth with deployment of fellow spectrum. But there have also been discussions about how networks are dense enough and how additional capacity.","And I\u2019m just trying to sort of triangulate in terms of the opportunities that for you folks, I mean do you see those types of carriers looking to densify their networks? How should we think about the potential amendment opportunities going forward with things like AWS-3 in terms of providing support for the longer term runway?","Ben Moreland","Sure, and I think what you\u2019re referring to is Amir is the inherent trade-off that is between spectrum and densification i.e. to the extent you have more spectrum you can do more with your existing sites and within to lay the need to densify in a particular area if you otherwise didn\u2019t have spectrum. And that\u2019s true, and yet what we see is kind of all the above.","So as the carriers come in and launch new spectrum, to get maximum efficiency out of that very expensive spectrum, they\u2019re typically adding more equipment to the site, to the existing site. That just makes sense. The cost of that incremental amendment on a tower is nothing compared to getting the maximum value out of the spectrum in that particular geography. And that\u2019s what is driving a lot of our amendment activity across all of the carriers and as has for years. I don\u2019t see that changing.","But in addition to that, you\u2019re not going to cover the capacity requirements simply by adding spectrum to existing site. It\u2019s mathematically impossible you can\u2019t get the capacity requirements that are required. And so what happens is, in addition to adding that spectrum on existing sites, you\u2019re then seeing small cells added in an underlay approach which gives them multiples of that spectrum, capacity, because they\u2019re then reusing that spectrum in that geography and unloading, effectively unloading the capacity challenge on the macro side.","So you\u2019re going to see both, it\u2019s exactly what\u2019s driving our business today. The carriers are obviously being very rational about how do they prioritize their spend and they\u2019re looking at spectrum auctions and having to pay for the spectrum up front. And then how do they maximize that capacity overtime. And then various carriers, they are in various stages of that today whether that\u2019s cell site densification or macro site amendment. But all of that drives our business and it\u2019s something that we think is going to continue for a long, long time.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much. And then dovetailing on to small cells, it seems as though the growth has been a bit higher than expected, but of course it also seems like we\u2019re still at the very early stages of adoption, particularly when we think about sort of a neutral hosting business model. I mean, there has been some chatter in the marketplace with folks discussing opportunities to densify their networks going at it alone in terms of utilizing certain technologies or potentially possible rights of access or microwave backhaul or however you want to look at the combination of different opportunities. How do you sort of compare and contrast the opportunities that you folks have utilizing assets such as Sunesys or some of this land grab that you had mentioned versus carriers looking to potentially densify their network via small cells on their own sort of strategy?","Ben Moreland","Well, I think you\u2019re going to see sort of all the above and it\u2019s not new if you think about it. The wireless carriers essentially rebuilt the tower portfolio on their own balance sheet, since we as an industry acquired in the early 2000s and then elected to monetize it overtime in the last three years. I think carriers will from time to time experiment with lots of different methods to add capacities to their network, that\u2019s not new. It goes back to the earlier comment and there\u2019s a lot of different technology variations, I think, it\u2019s generally accepted that fiber connectivity for small cells and towers ultimately through dark fiber connectivity provides the most flexibility and the most capacity for a given location.","And so I think you\u2019re going to see overtime that fiber, whether you\u2019re talking about fiber-to-the-cell or fiber to the small cell, is a necessary element long-term to accomplish what they need. And it goes back to earlier comments on this call around cost of capital and the sharing model. Certainly it\u2019s possible for carriers to work and build their own systems and certainly free to do that and operate under the same constraints that we do around permitting, and zoning, and rights away and things like that. But to the extent they can avail themselves of a lower cost of capital, allow themselves to put their capital back to work in their primary business and we pass along some of that shared economics to them in that construct, that\u2019s going to make a lot of sense as it has for the last 20 years. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re pursuing.","Amir Rozwadowski","Excellent. Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Jay Brown","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery","Great, thanks very much. Ben and Jay congrats and good luck on your next move. Ben I wonder if you just talk a little bit about your new roll, I guess you\u2019re going to have a real focus on strategy. How do you see spending your time, and what are the real areas that you think you\u2019re going to be able to do dive deeper into with your new responsibilities?","And then sort of following-up from the last question for Verizon has talked about, a lot about 5G with trials coming up in the next month or two. Micro waves is going to be \u2013 frequencies are going be deployed there. Have you had much conversations with companies and with the equipment companies about the opportunities there and what that might mean, over say the next five or ten years? And we saw fixed wireless launched yesterday. So it does look like there\u2019s other technologies which are really starting to appear on the horizon here. If you could talk to that, that would be great?","Ben Moreland","Sure. First of all on the role Simon, we\u2019re filling out the list, but it keeps getting more items on it. I think initially, I\u2019m going to certainly continue to spend time on industry matters, whether that\u2019s your PCI or NAREIT. I\u2019m on the board of both organizations and we\u2019re making some good progress there in the interest of our company, as well as the broader industry. And I expect to continue in the capacity.","And then also I would expect to continue to work the executive team on matters of strategy, capital allocations, some of the discussions we\u2019ve had on the call. But would anticipate that given the longevity and tenure of the team, this executive team, and Jay in particular having worked together for 17 years and can finish each others [indiscernible], I do not think, we\u2019re going to have a difference of opinion very often on strategy. So it\u2019s really going to be a to the board and to industry matters that I think are increasingly important for us. As we look to continue to have the ability to deploy wireless infrastructure in a very efficient way across the country and just for those on this call that is not getting any easier, and so it\u2019s something that I\u2019m pretty focused on.","Simon Flannery","Any\u2026","Jay Brown","Go on\u2026","Simon Flannery","Any movement from NAREIT on sort of index inclusion?","Jay Brown","Nothing definitive yet, we will wait until August, and we have our new GICS code and see how that goes.","Simon Flannery","Okay. Thank you.","Ben Moreland","Simon on your second question, I think you can roll back the clock and see that as the carriers have migrated technology, that those have almost always been aimed at improving the consumer experience which is generally code for faster access to data network. And those have always resulted in additional need for network density. And I think regardless of \u2013 you rattled off a few opportunities that are on the horizon. And we\u2019re seeing carriers behave and think about the network planning whether we\u2019re talking to them about macro sites or small cells in a very similar way that it\u2019s going to result in additional network density being required and we think that\u2019s great for our opportunity, our opportunity as we deploy capital and see additional yield on the capital that we\u2019ve already deployed.","Simon Flannery","Right, thank you. ","Operator","Our last question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael","Great, thank you for fitting me in and to both of you congrats with your newer opportunities.","Ben Moreland","Thanks, Colby.","Colby Synesael","First up I wanted to kind of just levels of expectations around Sunesys. So can you just remind us how fast Sunesys grew in 2015? And then what the implied growth rate is off of the $105 million which you guided for 2016? I\u2019d appreciate that. Sunesys contributed $42 million to you in 2015. But I\u2019m just trying to get the year-over-year comparisons.","And then just talking more about small cell, you mentioned your focus on 25 markets and obviously looking beyond that, in those 25 markets roughly how many of those are you \u2013 that where you\u2019re comfortable with the amount of fiber that you have?","And really what I\u2019m getting at is, what\u2019s the likelihood of you going and doing another Sunesys like acquisition in 2016, how important is that to you when you think of strategy in areas you\u2019re focusing on for 2016? If that acquisition you were to do was to come with a larger percentage of enterprise or wholesale or is that definitely not small cell like business in terms of how they\u2019re using that fiber. Is that a business you\u2019re increasingly getting more comfortable getting into as we go forward, so that you\u2019re no longer just a small cell fiber provider but really something much more broader than that. Thanks.","Ben Moreland","Sure. Thanks for the question, Colby. On the first question when we did the Sunesys acquisition I know initially when we announced that we weren\u2019t sure exactly what the timing of the closing was going to be. The revenue growth year-over-year is a couple of million dollars. So the guidance that we gave you was what we were expecting in 2016. And really your two questions are fairly closely tied together. When we look at fiber in these markets and the opportunities that we\u2019re seeing more broadly than just Sunesys and whether that\u2019s expanding our portfolio on the top 25 market or as Ben referenced earlier if we\u2019re looking outside of the top 25 markets, our aim is to own fiber that is supported by the wireless carriers.","That\u2019s our core business and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. And so when we look at opportunities for fiber, that\u2019s what we have in mind, of what can we do with that fiber ultimately to drive yield on the capital invested. And we think that yield is going to be primarily driven through investment by the wireless carriers and I was adding nodes to those or in some cases doing fiber-to-the-cell.","There may be some acquisitions in the future, frankly as we talked about when we did the Sunesys acquisition we think that asset is really unique, it was dark fiber in major metro markets in the U.S. And while we have found a few tuck-in acquisitions like the one we did two years ago in the Baltimore, Washington area. Those are relatively rare. So we\u2019re not thinking about this as getting into per se the fiber business or expanding into the fiber business.","Over time, we may find opportunities to add additional yield through recurring revenue sources across the fiber that we own. Because of the location of the fiber it\u2019s in urban areas where there\u2019s a lot of density of population. And so we may find opportunities to add additional revenue and drive returns. But our focus both on the investment side as well as where we\u2019re focusing our sales effort is around supporting our wireless carrier customers. That\u2019s what we really want to do and what we want to be. ","So that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see us invest capital and focus our time and effort both in the near-term and what we believe currently will be the long-term strategy of the firm. ","Colby Synesael","And just to clarify when you said Sunesys expectations you grew a couple of million, are you saying that the 105 guidance for 2016 is effectively a couple of million higher than what Sunesys did as a whole in 2015?","Ben Moreland","That\u2019s correct. If we obviously we did not own Sunesys for the entire 2015 period. But that\u2019s what it grew year-over-year. ","Colby Synesael","That\u2019s great. Thank you. ","Ben Moreland","You bet.","Colby Synesael","Okay.","Ben Moreland","Well I appreciate everybody\u2019s time on call this morning. Thanks for the questions I know there was a long lived cheer and there are several folks who probably did not get to. We\u2019re around today so feel free to pick up the phone and call us or you can reach up Son Nguyen. And we\u2019re happy to get your questions. And look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation."],"6217":["Crown Castle International Corp.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Son Nguyen. Please go ahead.","Son Nguyen - Vice President-Corporate Finance & IR Officer","Thank you, Hannah, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we reveal our third quarter 2015 results. With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.","To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors sections of the company's SEC filings.","Our statements today are made as of October 22, 2015, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. In addition, today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the Supplemental Information package in the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Thanks, Son, and good morning everyone. As you can see from our third quarter results, we continue to execute at a consistently high level, exceeding the high end of our previously provided third quarter outlook, which allowed us to raise the outlook for the full year.","At the midpoint, our updated full year 2015 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.30 is up 8% compared to 2014. Similarly, for 2016 we are also expecting to deliver 8% growth in AFFO per share, up from $4.30 per share in 2015 to $4.66 per share in 2016. Further, our board has approved a dividend increase in line with our expected growth in 2016 AFFO per share, increasing the quarterly dividend by 8% from $3.28 per share to $3.54 per share on an annualized basis.","The increase in our common stock dividend reflects our commitment to delivering attractive, long-term total returns for our shareholders by growing the dividend over time. The strength of our business model, quality of our portfolio and cash flows and our strong balance sheet give us the confidence to commit to returning a significant portion of capital to shareholders in the form of a dividend, and at the same time, maintaining the flexibility to invest in growth opportunities that we believe will enhance long-term growth in AFFO and dividends per share.","Turning to third quarter results on slide 4, site rental revenue grew 7% year-over-year from $718 million to $765 million, an increase of $47 million. The $47 million increase is comprised of $16 million from the Sunesys acquisition, which closed during the quarter, and $43 million of organic rental revenue growth, net of $12 million in straight-line and other adjustments. The organic site rental revenue growth of $43 million represents growth of 6% year-over-year, comprised of approximately 10% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalations, net of approximately 4% from tenant non-renewals.","Moving to slide 5, our third quarter results for site rental revenue gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO exceeded the high end of our previously provided third quarter 2015 outlook, which did not include the Sunesys acquisition. Even after stripping out the contribution from Sunesys, which contributed $11 million in site rental gross margin during the quarter, we would have exceeded the high end of our outlook.","Turning to investment activities, as shown on slide 6, during the third quarter we invested $237 million in capital expenditures. These capital expenditures included $31 million in sustaining capital expenditures and $16 million in land purchases. Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business, as we look to control our largest operating expense and produce stable and growing cash flow over time.","Today, nearly 40% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own, and approximately three-quarters on land we own or lease for more than 20 years. Where we have ground leases, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years. Additional information regarding the land beneath our towers is available in our Supplemental Information package posted in the Investors section of our website.","Of the remaining capital expenditures, we invested $190 million in revenue-generating capital expenditures, consisting of $92 million on existing sites and $98 million on the construction of new sites, primarily small cell construction activity.","As previously mentioned, during the quarter we also closed on the Sunesys acquisition. Sunesys owns or has the rights to nearly 10,000 miles of fiber in major metro markets across the U.S., where we already have a small cell presence today and would expect to see meaningful amount of small cell activity in the future. Prior to the Sunesys acquisition, we owned or had rights to approximately 7,000 miles of fiber that supported 15,000 small cell nodes and growing. The addition of Sunesys' well located, high-quality fiber footprint more than doubles our fiber footprint available to support our small cell networks.","Year-to-date, excluding Sunesys, small cell site rental revenue has grown approximately 30%. While towers will continue to be the most efficient and cost-effective way for carriers to deploy their networks, we expect carriers to make investments in small cells to enhance their macro network by bringing cell sites closer to mobile subscribers, supplementing wireless coverage and capacity provided by a tower at a height of 100 to 150 feet that covers an eighth to a half a mile, with small cells deployed at a height of 20 to 30 feet on a traffic light that may cover a city block. We believe small cells represent the natural progression of network densification and cell splitting by the carriers as they contend with consumer demand for mobile data.","Shifting to financing activities, during the quarter we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.82 per share, or $274 million in aggregate. Further, we continue to maintain our long-term target leverage ratio of four to five times as we remain focused on achieving an investment-grade credit rating.","Moving on to full year 2015 outlook on slide 7, we have increased our expectations at the midpoint for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO \u2013 $60 million, $37 million, and $23 million, respectively. On a per-share basis, our updated 2015 outlook provides for AFFO per share growth of 8% year-over-year compared to 2014, increasing from $3.97 per share to $4.30 per share.","The increase in our 2015 outlook includes contribution from Sunesys of $40 million in site rental revenues and $30 million in site rental gross margin. The increase in the outlook also reflects the strong results from the third quarter, an increase in our expectations for leasing activity for the remainder of the year, and our expectations that a portion of tenant non-renewal previously expected to occur in 2015 will take place in 2016.","It is important to note that our overall expectations for the number of tenant non-renewals in aggregate remained unchanged. For 2016, at the midpoint of our outlook, we expect AFFO per share growth of 8% driven by the continued strength in leasing activity, the contribution of the Sunesys acquisition, and improving operating leverage in our business. On a normalized basis, adjusting for Australia and Sunesys, AFFO growth in 2016 would be between 6.5% and 7%, or towards the high end of our long-term AFFO growth target.","Moving from left to right on slide 8, our expectations for growth of approximately $150 million in site rental revenues is comprised of new leasing activity, or incremental revenue from new tenant installations and amendments to existing tenant leases, of approximately $170 million, consisting of tower leasing of approximately $115 million and small cell leasing of approximately $55 million.","The approximately $115 million in new leasing contribution from tower leasing is consistent with our long-term expectation of adding approximately one tenant-equivalent over 10 years across our portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers, or a tenth of a tenant per tower per year. To put that tenth of a tenant into perspective, over the last six years our annual leasing activity has ranged between 0.09 and 0.13 tenants per tower. Our organic growth is also supported by annual contracted tenant escalators on our towers and small cell leases of approximately 3%, which we expect will contribute approximately $95 million in growth during 2016.","Growth from new leasing activity and tenant escalation is expected to be offset by tenant non-renewals of approximately $105 million, to arrive at organic site rental revenue growth of $160 million or 6% growth year-over-year. As we've previously disclosed, the expectations for tenant non-renewals during 2016 is higher than our historical 1% to 2% annual non-renewal rate, due to elevated non-renewals from the decommissioning of a portion of the Leap, Metro and Clearwire networks. Site rental revenue growth during 2016 also benefits from year-over-year incremental contribution from the Sunesys acquisition of approximately $60 million.","More detailed information regarding our current book of contracted tenant leases, including the impact of straight-line accounting and expectations for non-renewals, is available in our Supplemental Information package.","Turning to slide 9, I want to spend a moment to walk you through the approximately $130 million of growth in AFFO from 2015 to 2016. Starting on the left-hand side, we have organic site rental revenue growth of approximately $160 million, offset by $35 million increase in normal, ongoing, operating and G&A expenses. The $35 million increase in expenses compared to the $160 million in organic site rental revenue growth drives incremental margins of approximately 80%, illustrating the improving operating leverage in our business.","For 2016, our expectations for network services gross margin is $230 million to $250 million, compared to our 2015 expectations of $280 million to $285 million. The decline in network services gross margin of approximately $40 million is attributable primarily to equipment decommissioning fees generated in 2015, which we do not expect to occur in 2016.","Additionally, 2016 AFFO growth benefits from a reduction in sustaining CapEx of approximately $25 million and other adjustments of approximately $20 million, which includes the incremental contribution from Sunesys. The approximately $130 million in expected growth in AFFO translates to approximately 8% growth in AFFO per share.","As Ben will discuss, we continue to believe that our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, with a particular focus on delivering high-quality dividend stream and disciplined capital allocation focused on long-term high-quality growth, will drive significant shareholder value over time.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Benjamin.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jay, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning. As you heard from Jay's remarks, based on our increased 2015 outlook, we expect to finish 2015 on a strong note and we look to continue this momentum moving into 2016. Consistent with the goal we communicated a year ago to deliver 6% to 7% annual AFFO per share growth organically, our 2016 outlook for AFFO per share provides for 8% growth at the midpoint, inclusive of about 150 basis points of benefit from the sale of our Australian subsidiary and acquisition of Sunesys. A year ago, we also stated our intention to deliver dividend growth in line with our expected growth in AFFO per share, and I'm pleased to announce that our board has approved an 8% increase in our stock dividend from $3.28 to $3.54 on an annualized basis.","Since we increased our dividend payout a year ago, we have closed the yield differential between the RMZ REIT Index by 50 basis points, outperformed the S&P 500 and RMZ year-to-date, and made good progress attracting the incremental long-term investor. With the latest dividend increase, we are continuing to build on our track record of delivering attractive total returns to shareholders. From 2015 to 2016, our total return expectations are 12%, comprised of the current 4% dividend yield and 8% growth in dividend.","Looking out beyond 2016, we remain confident in our long-term goal of generating 6% to 7% AFFO growth organically. Combined with the current dividend yield of 4%, we believe the long-term total return opportunity of 10% to 11% should be very compelling to investors, given the contracted nature of our business.","In fact, we believe a significant catalyst exists as we continue to deliver on expectations and differentiate Crown Castle from its peers in terms of capital allocation and strategic profile. Compared to the best-in-class REITs with dividend yields in the high 2%s to low 3% range, our dividend yield north of 4% suggests we have an opportunity to help investors appreciate the unique combination of high-quality yield and growth that we represent as an investment.","Further, out of 425 dividend-paying companies in the S&P 500, Crown Castle has the 383rd highest dividend yield, putting us in the bottom 10 percentile of dividend payers. While it's up to the market and investors to ultimately determine valuation, I believe there are several compelling points to the Crown Castle story that make the case for a lower dividend yield, and with it, a higher valuation.","First is the quality of our business model and long-term positive industry tailwinds. As has been true since the early days of the wireless industry, network quality continues to be the market differentiator for carrier success, driving continued long-term investments by the carriers. As such, we believe we are in a multi-year densification cycle that continuously requires all four major U.S. wireless carriers to make significant investments to improve and enhance their networks in order to meet consumer demand for mobile broadband, in order to remain competitive.","It's also clear that as network capacity and speed increases, new applications and services, such as mobile video, the connected car, and more broadly the Internet of Things, are developed the promising new avenues for carriers to monetize their network investments.","Our results to date and our expectations for the balance of 2015 and 2016 further reinforce our view, and demonstrate how well positioned we believe we are to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us. For some context, and highlighting the opportunity the carriers have in front of them, the growth in mobile data traffic in the U.S. from 2016 to 2017 is expected to equal all the mobile data traffic that was carried on cellular networks in 2014.","Mobile data is expected to double every two years through 2019, the furthest date that Cisco forecasts. In fact, earlier this week on Verizon's earnings call, they mentioned they've seen a 75% growth year-over-year in mobile data usage across their subscribers. As a shared wireless infrastructure provider, we benefit from growing demand for mobile broadband as carriers access our infrastructure to provide service for their subscribers.","Underlying the shared infrastructure model is our ability to generate returns by leveraging our fixed investment and operating expenses over multiple tenants, with each tenant benefiting from the capital-efficient model we present. In turn, our value proposition to the carriers is that we provide them with the quickest and most cost-effective access to infrastructure and real estate as they deploy and upgrade their networks.","As a case in point, we were encouraged by the roadmap that FirstNet has established to seek industry partners in a public-private partnership to facilitate a nationwide public safety network deployment, potentially in 2017. Although still very early, we believe our shared infrastructure portfolio will play a meaningful role in the efficient deployment of this network.","This brings me to my second point. We believe that the portfolio we have built and invested in over the last 20 years uniquely positions us to play a critical role in helping carriers with their network needs. In particular, over the last several years we have focused our investments in the U.S., with the acquisitions of T-Mobile and AT&T towers and continued investments in the small cell business, based on the thesis that there is a long runway of investments that need to be made in the U.S. by wireless carriers, and a consumer base that will support it.","Today, our portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers and 15,000 small cell nodes supported by 16,000 miles of fiber makes us the only company that can deliver at scale and provide comprehensive wireless solutions across the U.S. for carriers. Our towers are well located, with three-quarters of our portfolio in the top 100 markets, and have a long runway for additional organic growth with only two tenants per tower on average, suggesting a significant amount of leasing opportunity is yet to come.","On the small cell front, we are capitalizing on our leadership position to secure some of the best assets where we believe there will be a long-term franchise value that will drive future co-location, upgrade, and co-location opportunities similar to the early days of the tower industry 20 years ago. With small cells, we believe we are skating to where the puck is headed, as the theme of network densification continues into the future, and in so doing, extend our runway of growth and further reinforcing our leadership position in U.S. wireless infrastructure.","Together, the strength of our business model and the quality of our assets translates into a growing high-quality, long-term recurring cash flow stream. Today our average tenant lease term is about seven years, and is backed by committed contractual lease payments of $20 billion, which provides stable and predictable contracted cash flows supporting our dividend payout.","As we look to grow the dividend in the future, we benefit from contracted tenant lease escalators, which provide half of our stated goal of organic 6% to 7% growth in AFFO per share. As it relates to the other half, given the need for continued investments by our carriers \u2013 customers, and the quality of our portfolio, we believe that we can achieve our stated goal of growth through leasing on our portfolio of towers and small cells.","Said another way, including the dividend, approximately three quarters of our expected total return goal in already contracted in any given year. Quality of our cash flows is further highlighted by the focus in the U.S., where we benefit from what we believe is an attractive operating and investing environment that has a degree of visibility and long runway of growth without foreign currency exposure that can impact returns.","Our goal as a management team is to provide our investors with the most compelling risk-adjusted long-term total shareholder returns, as measured by dividend growth over time. To close, we are very pleased to be in a position to raise our outlook and dividend by 8% as we approach 2016, which reflects the quality of our assets, the expertise of our team, and positive fundamentals of the U.S. wireless industry from which we benefit.","And with that, operator, I'd be happy to turn the call over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our first question from David Barden with Bank of America.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks. Nice results out this morning. I would say that the big conversation that we were having last night after the print was really trying to think about next year's growth. So, in the first quarter to the second quarter, we saw about $6 million of sequential site leasing and management revenue. In the third quarter, backing out Sunesys, it was probably $12 million. In the fourth quarter, backing out Sunesys again, the implication is you're looking for $8 million. And then if I annualize the fourth quarter and look at 2016, the implication is that you're only going to be getting $4 million of incremental revenue to get to the midpoint of the future guidance. And so, I don't think people think that the industry is slowing down. But if you could kind of help us figure out how we get from still robust growth to what appears to be a rapidly decelerating sequential revenue growth guide, it would be super helpful.","And then, just the second question would be \u2013 and maybe it's related, is relative to 2015, it looks like the straight-line revenue is coming down a lot. And if you could kind of address what contracts, or kind of what is the driver of that function, it'd be great. Thanks so much.","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Sure, Dave. On the first question, anytime I think you go quarterly sequential changes in revenue, particularly in the periods where we've had the disposition of Australia and then as you think about us rolling into Sunesys, that may be a little distracting to look at it quarter-to-quarter on that.","I would point you to full year. And our underlying assumption in terms of tenant activity, as I mentioned in my comments, is right around the tenth of a tenant that we would expect to add in 2016. We're expecting basically that same level of leasing activity in 2015.","And one of the ways that you could point to it, outside of talking about it in terms of tenant adds per tower, is our underlying assumption is that on the tower side, we'll have about $115 million of tower leasing growth from 2015 to 2016, and virtually that same number from 2014 to 2015. So the assumption we're giving you here for the outlook in 2016 driving the top line number, our view is that we're basically holding that assumption the same in 2015 and 2016, and would expect the year to kind of play out that way based on the total activity we can see to date.","In the second question, the straight-line revenue number that you see decreasing, in essence what you see is the non-cash portion of that straight line revenue decreasing. And the reason for that is the annual cash escalator that's embedded in our leases. And so, we would expect that number to continue to decrease, and you can roughly approximate that number by taking our adjusted organic site rental revenue and then looking at the escalator of roughly about 3%. And absent any changes, and obviously there's always changes because we're assuming additional revenue adds next year, but absent those changes, that number's going to go down by the equivalent of about 3% on an annual basis.","So, straight-line's decreasing in essence because of the cash escalator that we have embedded in those leases. We would expect that number to continue to decrease to about 2017, 2018, at which point we would expect cash revenue received from tenants to actually exceed our GAAP revenue. So I think the trend line that you're seeing in that is something that we would expect to continue for the foreseeable future.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And, Jay, if I could just follow-up real quick. Obviously we started out this year pretty soft, and we've been seeing in your \u2013 as you kind of waterfall the numbers for us, it's been about 5.3% and then 5.9%, and now in this quarter 6.4% organic site leasing revenue growth, and yet you're still next year guiding to kind of the same absolute dollar number of revenue, irrespective of the fact that the revenue growth has been accelerating this year. Are you trying to point to some specific deceleration in one of the growth drivers that's been leading to the accelerating revenue year-to-date, or is this just trying to be conservative?","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","I think, Dave, as we went into calendar year 2015, our working assumption was that tower revenue growth was going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of about $90 million to $100 million of new leasing activity, be that from brand new leases as well as amendments. And as we've gone through the balance of 2015, we've actually increased that assumption by about 10% to 15% roughly, to get to the $115 million of expectation. And then we're going to hold that into our 2016 guide, based on the activity that we would expect to continue from the carriers throughout 2016.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Jay.","Operator","And next we'll go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. Good morning. I'm just continuing on that theme about the 2016 guidance. You were talking about the activity you've seen. Clearly, this year we had two carriers very active and two carriers pretty quiet. Are you getting any sense that we can go to a more balanced environment in 2016, or is it just too early for you to actually bake that into your guidance? So could there be some upside as, I guess, say Sprint got some financing or AT&T resumes their sort of normal level of capital spending?","And then, I do see you're suggesting services gross margin down $40 million, and with some of that related to the decommissioning coming down. How much of the $40 million is the decommissioning versus just another level \u2013 a lower level of activity being assumed going forward? Thanks.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Hey, Simon, it's Ben. I'll take you back a few years, and for many of us on this call, I think you remember this. We used to really refrain from speaking with really any specificity around carrier deployment plans. And over the last couple of years, we've sort of relaxed that standard, and probably spoken a little bit too much occasionally around specific carrier deployment plans. And as a result, I've been asked by a few of our friends and customers if we would refrain from talking about their specific plans, and let them do their own talking about their deployment plans. And I think that's a perfectly reasonable request, and frankly a pretty good reminder of the way we used to do things.","So, unfortunately, the way I'm going to answer your question, you may not be completely satisfied with, but when we give you the $115 million of tower rental growth \u2013 again, consistent to 2015 \u2013 that takes into account everything that we expect to see out of the combination of all four carriers, as we know it, as we sit here in late October of the prior year.","And as you certainly note, because you've modeled the company very thoroughly, if we saw a tick-up inside the year next year from a particular carrier or two, that would have a relatively small financial impact inside that year, obviously being more impactful into 2017. But all within the range of this sort of range that Jay gave you in his prepared remarks of kind of up or down 20% is sort of what we've seen back for the last seven years. And that up or down 20% goes back to when all four carriers were building out LTE, to a time when maybe they were a little bit slower. And that up or down 20% would be about 1% change in AFFO per share growth.","So, I think we've given you all the detail you need, and particularly in the supplement , we'll show you quarter-to-quarter changes in revenue from the carriers so you can certainly see it on a trailing basis, sort of who's doing what. But I'm really going to try to not really speak about specific terms of sort of who's doing what in the marketplace because it's certainly \u2013 a lot of that is proprietary information.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. But your basic message is, you're currently modeling about a similar level of activity?","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","The carriers ...","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That is the absolute message, is that we're modeling off of the activity we've seen in this year, which is \u2013 as Jay suggested, has ramped through the year and we are seeing application volume sort of ramp as we come in to the fourth quarter, and that is all taken into account in our expectations. And again, we try to stay with whole numbers, because you lose a few percentage points, a few basis points on the larger base every year, when you're just looking at percentages.","And then on your service gross margin question, down $40 million, yeah, that's one-timers that occurred in 2015 around pay-and-walk fees and a few other things that we don't expect to repeat in 2016. So importantly, our sort of core service contribution in the 240 to 250 range is the core contribution we're seeing this year. So we're looking at it to be comparable to 2015.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And next we'll go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Two things. One, to follow up on David's question, and not any particular carrier, but it seems like it's been about five years since you signed some of the MLAs that we've talked extensively about in the past. Do any of those expire in 2016? And how should we think about the GAAP and cash impact as those roll off?","And then second, Ben, can you follow up on your comments about FirstNet? And just expand on the opportunity here and how you see the architecture of shared versus proprietary network that they're planning?","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Phil, on your first question, the structures that we had signed up with the carriers where they were committing to a certain level of leasing and going ahead and paying us for that in advance of actually putting equipment on the towers, those have virtually completely been used up at this point. So I think we talked about, going into 2015, we were expecting somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10% of the activity in total on amendments that would have already been provided for and we're already being paid for in the structure of those agreements.","Today, virtually every lease we have where the carriers are putting additional equipment on the tower is adding additional site rental revenue to the mix. So we're really past that stage at this point. And as we think about the 2016 activity, we're not really factoring in any amendments that would not bring additional site rental revenue.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Phil, on your comment around FirstNet, look, I'm encouraged. The webinar earlier \u2013 the webcast earlier, a few days ago, indicated for me a pretty clear road map of time lines and dates to launch a deployment here, in the way that we've always felt like is the most efficient. And from their point of view, I think they've suggested that it will only consume about 5% of the spectral capacity of their spectrum on any given day, and so that's a tremendous opportunity for the industry to use that remaining spectrum, high-quality spectrum.","And as a result, there's going to be a fairly complicated and yet unknown RFP process to go through exactly what will a carrier or a collection of carriers by market, maybe splitting it out, pay for it, and what's it's worth to them? And that part is not clear and still very complicated, and I think presents a fair amount of uncertainty still. But I do believe they're on the right track of looking at a shared network that will likely be hosted across one or multiple carriers' networks, which we certainly can accommodate and expect to participate in and use our infrastructure to do so in a very efficient way.","So, I think in previous calls we basically said we don't have any clear direction. I think we now have some clear direction about where they're headed, and that's encouraging, albeit it's probably not financially material into, really into 2018, because if you're probably starting on deployments mid-2017, wouldn't have any real financial consequence probably until you get into 2018. But we're encouraged.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next we'll go to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, guys. One quick follow-up to Phil's. Jay, not just the MLAs, but you guys mentioned how you bought T-Mobile towers and AT&T towers. I think there was some reserved space or future space in those deals as well. So, MLAs and M&As, you guys are pretty much through any free space, if you will?","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","That's correct, Ric. My answer would apply to both situations.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then I want to dig a little deeper on Sunesys and small cells, if I could, so I apologize for going a little deeper dive. On Sunesys, I think you were guiding to about $75 million in gross margins and $60 million or so in EBITDA after G&A. When the deal was announced, you thought the first year of Sunesys, gross margins might be more $80 million to $85 million and EBITDA might be more $60 million to $65 million. So, what has happened in Sunesys, given that we closed the deal early and a little lower number for calendar 2016?","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Yeah, Ric, it just has to do with the way they classified direct operating expenses and G&A, as compared to the way we would do it. So when we got in and started to figure out how we would reflect the results of the business, we did it consistent with the way we would look at towers, and reflected some of those expenses in different categories. So the net number is unchanged. We just \u2013 we moved some of the expenses from direct operating expenses and G&A in order to match the way we think about it on the tower side, to be consistent.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And you've mentioned where you hoped that there's some meaningful ability to get small cells on top of it? It looks like the guidance is still kind of business as usual at Sunesys, as far as their legacy. Have you assumed any small cell extra growth onto that asset?","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, Ric, the way we're thinking about the Sunesys asset today is really inventory, and I'd be thrilled to come on the call in a couple of quarters and tell you that the activity has ramped beyond what we're seeing today, but the way we think about it is, we just bought inventory and it's a cost advantage and a speed advantage for deployment of the pipeline that we currently see and what we expect.","And so, as we've said, our expectation for small cell revenue growth is about $55 million next year, consistent with what we've seen this year. By implication, you can say the pipeline looks steady. If it were to grow from there, then terrific, and that's kind of what we are pursuing. And we have a lot more inventory with which we can deploy small cells on, again on a very cost-effective basis, because we've essentially \u2013 we already own the asset, and on an expedited basis because we don't have to build it. But right now, we're not guiding to an incremental increase in revenue contribution from there today.","Now, your last question is around Sunesys specifically. I would say, having owned it a very short period of time, there's a very modest amount of revenue growth within the Sunesys traditional business, but that's not core and not something that we would spend a lot of time focusing on with you.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Makes sense. And last question is, when you look at the CapEx that you spent within the quarter, I think it was about $98 million for new builds, primarily all of it small cells, should we think about still that old rule of thumb about $100,000 per node if it's a new node? We haven't seen a lot of change in the node count, still 15,000 approximately last quarter and this quarter. We're just trying to get our model correct as far as, as you spend CapEx on the small cell, when does it roll into being nodes on the air and the revenue coming in?","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Yeah. You're right about the $100,000 per node. That's the best way to model the business, and consistent with our expectation. As we've reflected the nodes, we've shown that number as a combination of nodes under construction and those on air, and rounded it. And so you haven't seen it move, but that would just be inside of the rounding of 15,000.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And you know me, I'd love to get some more segment details on small cell as far as revenues, margins, and actually some quantity. So as you consider now, it's 11% of the business pro forma, hopefully someday we'll get some more details?","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Rick. We're continuing to look at that, and provided obviously some pretty meaningful detail in the slides that I talked about and then also in the supplement. As we're going through the process of integrating Sunesys, we're re-looking again at kind of our operating reporting relationships and the best way to operate the business, and then the best way to reflect and review the results ourselves. And that may result in us doing disclosures a little differently than what we've done historically. But we are trying as much as we can to provide you the information you need to evaluate how well the business is operating.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","We'll take just some decimal points too, probably. Anyway, thanks, guys.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. First, could you go back to the slide where you walk through different revenue drivers for 2016? And can you talk about how much of the internal growth in 2016 is generated by Sunesys versus the amount that you have in the external growth bucket?","And then the second question I had, just taking a step back on leverage, can you talk a little bit about why you think it's so important to drive towards investment grade credit metrics and try to get an investment grade credit rating? And have you modeled the alternative, if you didn't do that, maybe what your leverage or AFFO growth per share might look like in the alternative? Thanks.","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Yeah. On your first question, Mike, when we talk about the $115 million in tower leasing and the $55 million in small cell leasing, you should think about that as basically our legacy business prior to the acquisition of Sunesys. And the benefit that we'll have in Sunesys is over in the acquisition category of roughly $60 million. I assume you're referring to slide 8 in your question there. So, the way to think about that I think is pretty consistent with what we've done in 2015, similar assumptions in 2016.","On your second question around investment grade, we have spent a lot of time working on that and run the exact analysis that you articulated between remaining non-investment-grade versus investment grade. And I would say for a long period of time, Ben and I have held the view that the value creation is driven in our business over the long term by three different areas. One of those is obviously organic leasing on the assets that we already own. Secondly, by the way that we allocate capital; and today, we're obviously allocating a meaningful portion of capital to what we believe to be growth-enhancing around small cells.","And then thirdly, by reducing and taking actions that reduce the overall expected cost of equity in our business. And there are a lot of aspects of that that have implications in terms of how we operate the business. One of those, which we've obviously spent the last several years talking a lot about, is our focus on the U.S. market and our unwillingness to go to emerging markets.","And as we think about the business that we're running, it's a growing annuity of cash flow payments out of the various wireless carriers. And underlying that is obviously the credit quality and stability and predictability of those cash flows coming from those wireless operators. And our view is that over time, as the story is better understood, the understanding of that risk should necessarily reduce the overall cost of the equity.","Commensurate with that is having a balance sheet that, regardless of market conditions, has access \u2013 free access to the capital markets. And we believe the investment grade credit rating, as much as the rating is, is an indication of how we manage the balance sheet. So that in maybe less favorable times than we are currently in the capital markets, we would maintain the access and there would never be a question about whether we would be able to pay the dividend if we were in a relatively choppy capital market.","So it's a combination of factors, but we think it has implications longer term as we think about lowering the cost of the equity and driving long-term returns to shareholders.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would just add one thing, Mike, if you will. If you run out the model long term, which we have, staying levered like we used to, it makes a very insignificant difference to the overall return, and obviously increases the risk profile materially, as Jay just walked through, in times when markets are disrupted.","The other thing I would say though, just more broadly about our business, as we've all worked on this for a long time, we have a fabulous business model around shared infrastructure, where it's generally cheaper for a carrier to occupy one of our facilities and benefit from the capital efficiency of sharing than it is to do it themselves. We can sort of get double benefit out of that, to the extent our absolute cost of capital can be less than our carrier customers, where you are less reliant on co-location over time to the extent you can demonstrate over time that your absolute cost of capital is less than the carrier customers because of the nature of our cash flow being long term contracted, with escalators, out of what we believe has always been the most senior secure cash flow stream coming out of the wireless industry, which is that to operate their network.","So that's a long-term aspirational goal. I wouldn't suggest to you we're there yet, but it's something that we've had \u2013 we always take a long-term view. And I think the next sort of generation of this business will be that we will have an absolute cost of capital, including total return expectations on our equity, that's lower than our customers'. And that's a wonderful place if we can ever get there, and that's what we're pursuing.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks. Just two quick follow-ups. With regard to Sunesys, you know how you're not really trying to grow the existing business, but could you just remind us about the durability of those existing customer relationships, meaning so you maybe continue to run rate that $100 million-plus of revenue? And then you noted that there's going to be about a $35 million increase in spending. I was hoping we could get a little more detail on what's behind that.","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Sure. We think the revenues are very durable. The growth rate there in escalations roughly is about 3% on an annual basis. So, we would expect to see some uplift there. And then contracted terms is about five years. So a little less than what we see on the tower side, but still, nonetheless, pretty long term in nature.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And on the increase in spending you're expecting next year?","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You mean expense growth? Is that what you're asking?","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, the expense growth, yes.","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Yeah. That's a little less than 3%. If you look at total direct operating expenses and G&A, it's about 2.8% increase in expenses year-over-year, excluding obviously what we're bringing on from Sunesys.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Is some of that related to the small cell business, or is it just the normal inflation in costs?","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Yeah, normal inflation in costs. We would see that across the business.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And, I guess, I will just ask one quick follow-up along that. I mean, how do you feel about the spending growth around the small cell business? You had noted previously that the spending was growing more rapidly than, say, the rest of your overhead expense as you were growing the business. I mean, at what point are we going to start to see that level off and maybe get a bit more operating leverage from the growth in your Dash revenues?","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Brett, you're seeing that today, which is kind of the point I made in my prepared remarks about the 80% incremental margins. For the last several years as we were really building out the overall infrastructure for small cells, as well as integrating the large tower acquisitions that we did, we saw spending on increasing span of control and management level folks, in addition to the more operating level jobs that we put in place in order to operate those assets, and so our incremental margins came down from what we've seen historically.","As we think about 2016 though, we think about it in a much more normalized basis as, again, from an operating cost standpoint, that coming down much more in line with what we've seen historically in the business, just under 3%, and therefore, the incremental margins that we see on the incremental revenue being put into the business is coming out at about 80%.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Two lines of questioning. You mentioned I think in response to Simon that you're seeing some increase in application volume. I was wondering if we could just kind of parse through that. So, is that fairly even across all four carriers? Are you seeing one or two carriers potentially carrying the torch there? Also -- but you don't have to tell us which ones! Also, I was trying to get a sense, amendments versus new sites. And then also, has that really been a steady ramp through 2015, or are you seeing some form of slight inflection?","And then just the other line of questioning had to do with the acquired churn. We saw in the supplemental that it's assumed to be up in 2016 and 2017 versus what you previously had last quarter. Is that simply some of the pushout that you described, or is there an actual absolute change in the acquired churn that you're now expecting? Thanks.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Hey, Colby, it's Ben. Yeah, the churn is no change in the total. It's just sliding from 2015 to 2016, unfortunately, and a little bit into 2017. So obviously we'd rather get it done sooner than later, but it moves a little bit. And it was our best guess when we originally gave you that number.","And then in terms of activity, I'll just sort of stick with what I said before. Look, we've got application volume up in the second half of this year. I'm pleased to see what I'm looking at for fourth quarter. But again, I want to tell you that that's in our expectations for 2016. So that $115 million we're giving you is our best view today of what we're looking at. And again, earlier on in the call, even if we started to beat that number, again, 20% up would be technically about 0.5% in the first year, and a full percent or a little more than a full percent in the second year.","So, I really think it's a less than productive discussion to go down the path of who's doing kind of what to whom, when we tell you that we've got it all in there, and we'll tell you on a trailing basis exactly by quarter who's doing what in terms of total revenue, so you can kind of see it.","And beyond that, I'll really direct it back to our four carrier customers to talk about their specific deployment activity.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","And just one follow-up to that. Any color, though, on whether it's more amendments versus new sites?","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Pretty similar in what we expect in 2016 to what we've seen in 2015. And I think last quarter we talked about this a little bit, and we talked about the fact that it's returned to a more normalized level, where we're in a neighborhood of about 40% or so of amendments and about 60% from new leases. I don't see anything really changing. It obviously moves around a little bit quarter-to-quarter depending on what work we're working on for which carrier, but somewhere in that neighborhood would be my working assumption for 2016.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And congrats on the quarter.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. I was interested in the small cell leasing growth that you're expecting next year, and is most of that going to continue to be anchor tenant growth, or is there any signs of interests and hopes that you could get additional tenancies in the next couple of quarters on that infrastructure? And then more broadly talking about fiber assets, I just wondered if there's an opportunity to modify unused fibers that you wouldn't need in the normal course of your small cell expansions? Thanks.","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Jon, on your first question, the activity we're seeing today, about 75% is related to new builds, and I'm talking specifically to small cells. About 75% is where we're building new systems, and about 25% is lease-up on existing systems, and that would be similar to our assumptions for 2016 that that rate will continue.","The other thing I would point to, broadly, is if we look at the level of lease-up activity and compare that to what we're seeing in towers, we're seeing lease-up on small cells occur at a rate faster than that of towers today, across all the small cell networks that we've built. We're about a tenant and a half roughly across those existing systems. And obviously, we've not owned them or built them that long ago.","So making the comparison that I made earlier in the conversation in my prepared remarks about adding about 0.1 tenant per tower per year, or one tenant over a 10-year basis, we're ahead of that as you think about the tenancy adds.","The other way to think about it is, how are we doing on a yield basis, if you think about the annual recurring cash flow coming off of small cells compared to the total net capital that we put into them. We're building systems, as you've heard us talk about, initial yield of about 6% to 7%. And today, the yields across the entire book of business, considering all of the capital that we've spent, including the amount of capital we just spent on the Sunesys acquisition that came in at about 6% initial yield, the whole book of business is now at about 8.5% yield.","So, we have meaningfully increased the yield on those assets, and that's driven almost entirely by the additional lease-up that we've seen on those systems that we've built. So, obviously, we're encouraged about how well the co-location has gone. Some of you may have seen the system that we built in Philadelphia recently. That system went on air, it was a system that we've been working on for about a year or a year and a half or so. It went on air in a densely populated area that got some recent press coverage, went on air with three tenants on it, day one. Obviously that's not our underwriting assumption and it doesn't happen every time, but we're starting to see more and more of the carriers want to co-locate and lease up these systems that are being built in phenomenal areas around the country.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then, Jon, on your comment about monetizing unused fiber. That's absolutely something we're looking at. We couldn't put that in guidance yet. But in terms, there's two ways to do that. One would be to contract with third parties, other providers who might want to use it, as we did with Sunesys before we owned them. Or, alternatively, the Sunesys sales force gets turned loose on our fiber that we own, where we can add monetization through additional contracts on that fiber.","We're looking at both of those things. We'll probably pursue them both, as that's just prudent to get the return out of the investment. I wouldn't say that's certainly not meaningful in the numbers as we look at and having owned it a couple of months, but it's an opportunity for us nonetheless. Not the core business and not why we did the transaction, but it's revenue and margin none the same that I think we can go out and get.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. And good morning, folks.","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Hey, Amir","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wanted to build upon the prior question in terms of co-location opportunities when it comes to small cells. There has been some debate among some of the carriers in terms of the strategy at which they are going to deploy small cells, at least some of the commentary that we've been hearing in terms of their strategy.","As you sit today, it does sound like the opportunity set for a certain number of carriers seems to be improving. How should we think about the longer term opportunity? Do you think that some of these technologies are viable over the longer term? Is there going to be a hybrid approach towards some of those small cell deployments, whereby you'll still be able to capture your fair share of co-location opportunities? We'd love to hear your thoughts on that.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Amir, this is Ben. I think we've already seen an evolution in some of the technologies, with some carriers wanting a lit service, what we would think of as a small-cell application versus a dark service \u2013 a full turnkey dark service, which is a distributed antenna system, sort of a switch, which the majority of what we have today, and still what we're still deploying today.","So think that will happen over time, depending on what particular issue the carriers are trying to address in that location. From where we look at it today, though, we're getting long-term contracts where we're starting with a very healthy initial yield, as Jay just walked you through, and co-location opportunities that are today tracking north ahead of where a traditional sort of tower acquisition would be, and we're doing it in areas where, as you've seen some of the maps, 90% of the activity is in the top 25 markets in the U.S. that we think are frankly beachfront real estate for purposes of these systems, just like we did when we acquired tower portfolios 15 years ago.","So, we think it's a terrific long-term objective, but it's location-specific. I mean, there are places where carriers have needs where we've been a little sheepish about going, honestly, because they've been second- and third-tier markets where one particular carrier might have had a need, but it's harder to underwrite when that second or third carrier would have a similar need. And that's just like the tower business by the way.","So, we're being pretty careful about where we deploy the capital. And so far, to move the needle as we've moved it, as Jay just walked through, on almost $3 billion of life-to-date capital spend in that business, tracking at about an 8.5% yield today suggests we're on the right path. It is still very early days. We are going to have the capability \u2013 we already have the capability, and I think we'll continue to enhance it to accommodate whatever level of architecture or technology the carrier wants to deploy.","And it's very clear that backhaul connected to fiber on net is the preferred approach to a durable system that provides sort of scalability in terms of backhaul. And that's what we provide. And so, we're thrilled to death and going about as hard as we can go right now, as we have said before.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. And if I may, one follow-up question, I know we've talked about technology disruption in the industry for some time now, and there's always been percolating conversations around Wi-Fi dislocation and stuff along those lines. Recent news suggests that there is someone of significant heft that may be looking to deploy a service over the near to midterm. How do you think about that in terms of the reality of investment and potential disruption for your market, if that was to come to fruition?","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I rely on our history, honestly, and I rely on our carrier customers' view of this topic, which is, we already have more than half of wireless traffic or data on Wi-Fi networks today, and it's a very efficient offload strategy that we all benefit from as consumers. And I think that the wireless carriers with licensed spectrum would have a very hard time supporting all of that if there wasn't an efficient offload strategy. And I think that's going to continue.","Verizon talked about it on their call, though. They don't think that's necessarily the path for them going down with licensed spectrum to be able to control the network and the network quality. But I think we as consumers have a view that when you jump off of your contracted carrier network and you get on Wi-Fi, wherever you happen to be, I don't think you have the same expectation of service. And maybe that's a benefit ultimately to the carriers over time.","But in order to accommodate the growth in data services that we're all seeing, and we see it in the press every single day with new applications and devices, our view is that it's going to take all commerce. It's going to take towers first and foremost, that we, again, have a belief that we will have every tenant on every tower over the long term. We think there's absolutely no reason \u2013 unless there's obviously a competing site, which as you know is very rare in the tower business \u2013 that you wouldn't have all four carriers on every tower over time, almost by definition. Obviously we don't give you that in our 2016 guidance, but that's our long-term thesis.","Behind that comes then the small cell architecture, where as we've talked about it now for a couple of years, the benefit of the small cell capacity offload is, what it's essentially doing, it's dealing with a hot spot where there's a capacity issue in an urban environment. It's also unloading a macro site and making it more efficient. We think it takes that, in scale, and we think there will be hundreds of thousands of nodes over time.","And then on top of that, just to finish out your question, absolutely agree there'll be Wi-Fi capability as there is today. Perhaps we all as consumers will accept a lower threshold of service in a stationary environment, not a mobile environment. But we think it takes all of the above to accommodate the Internet, the broadband Internet usage that we're all seeing in the connected devices, and obviously mobile video.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for taking the questions.","Operator","And next we'll go to Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Tim K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Just a couple of follow-ups. FirstNet, do you think it can be material, kind of the 120 basis points increase of revenue growth over time? And secondly, on AT&T, it sounds like the reserve capacity got used up a little bit faster than you were expecting. I think definitely faster than what the company was expecting. And I just have one follow-up. Thanks.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Tim. On the FirstNet revenue contribution, I don't know how to model that yet. It's just too early. I don't know who is going to be the winner of the RFP and exactly what the economics are. I think for purposes of your thinking, certainly to the extent it's a discrete application on a tower, that would look like a co-location. And I think they've said upwards of 40,000 sites that they need. We support that and look at what they're trying to accomplish, it sounds reasonable to potentially a little bit low. To the extent it's a shared application where they're going to co-locate, it looks more like an amendment, which we're certainly able to price, and it would an efficient use of the structural capacity on the tower and be very quick to deploy.","But I can't \u2013 I don't want to sit here and tell you what that mix is going to be yet. I just \u2013 there's no way to know at this stage. And with respect to sort of where we are on AT&T and that particular portfolio, I think Jay's comments I'll just probably leave alone. That's probably about as far as we ought to go.","Tim K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. And then on the small cell side, are you seeing any new competitors coming in to that market, or maybe just as you get more and more experience, your thoughts on the barriers to entry? Thanks.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. As I've said before, I think there will be more competitors over time. It's an enormous market, when you start thinking of geographies at the per-city-block level, there's a lot, a lot to get done. And certainly, we can't do it all, and we see other competitors in the market and others that are gaining capabilities. And I think that will happen over time. We're getting long-term contracted terms to amortize the investment.","And in terms of the barriers to entry, this is purpose-built fiber. And particularly, with what we're doing today, it's a very high consumer of strands, purpose-built back to a hub location. It's not easily replicated. And so we're very confident that once you get an installed base and it's serving the need of that particular carrier, again, on an efficient basis, we think it's a very sticky business. Not too worried about the long-term barriers to entry here.","Tim K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. Thank you very much. I think most of my questions have been answered, but maybe I'll hit this. How do you think about \u2013 you mentioned Cisco continuing to talk about mobile data doubling each year through 2019. As you think about how the carriers are going to try to handle that, how do you guys go about modeling that into your assumptions going forward? I realized you're only giving out 2016 at this point, but your thoughts on that would be helpful. Thanks.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. You know, Michael, we sort of view this one year at a time. I just gave you on the previous question kind of my long-term view on why we bought all these towers and why we think those are still the most attractive and efficient way for carriers to add capacity in a market, and then as we've talked about, pleased with what we're seeing on the small cell site as a complement to that.","I think it's very clear, we all have underestimated, probably forever, what the demand would be on the wireless networks, and then what we would need to provide as infrastructure. What I look carefully at \u2013 and I think this is going to be interesting to watch, and Verizon talked about it a little bit on their call \u2013 is opportunities to start monetizing the network in a different way than what we all traditionally would think of as sort of subscriber, sort of monthly payments.","And so, if you want to know kind of what we're watching, that's interesting to us as they generate new revenue streams as a way to further monetize the network. And I realize today that's financially immaterial, but I think that that will ultimately drive the incremental investment in the networks that, obviously, we benefit from.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Then a, one last one. I think a few months ago you said in 2016 you're assuming a mix of about 40% amendments and 60% leases for 2016. If I'm correct on that, can you remind us what 2015 is, and I believe you said that lease ups are up. So, should I assume if 2016 is increased at that 60% for leases over 2015, are you at a 70% run rate kind of as a catch-up right now? How can we think about that right now?","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Yeah. Michael, the expectation for 2015 is honestly pretty similar to that of 2016, so it may move a few percentage points between new leases and amendments, but I didn't mean to imply that we were seeing a big move in the type of applications or the type of activity. Our assumption for 2016 is pretty similar, both in terms of gross dollars as well as the mix.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay, great. Sorry, I ran out of questions. I figured I'd give it a shot. Thanks.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's all right. We're running past time for everybody, sorry about that. Trying to get everybody in.","Operator","Next we'll go to Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I may. First, on the leverage side, I'm seeing that leverage ticked up a little bit quarter-over-quarter, and maybe that's because we don't have a full quarter of Sunesys in here to reflect on the EBITDA that you've paid for. But could you give us a little bit of perspective of how we get down to four to five times leverage over the next whatever period of time it's going to take?","And then the second question, I just want to circle back on sort of how we could think about revenue-generating CapEx as we go forward. My bad, I didn't do a good job of modeling that this quarter. But would it be fair to maybe think about the $55 million of incremental small cell leasing you're going to get next year? I think, Jay, you said 75% of that is going to be sort of on new systems, so take three quarters of that and then sort of gross it up based on your initial yields of 6% to 7%?","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Yeah. On your first question, Jonathan \u2013 thanks for the questions. On your first question around Sunesys, you're right about how to do the leverage calculation. It ticked up a little bit just because we did not have a full quarter of Sunesys in that calculation. We would expect to get down to the four to five times over time through growth in EBITDA. We're not making an assumption that we're going to allocate capital towards paying down debt, but rather just growth in the business as we've laid out kind of our growth forecast. So we think the main growth in the business is going to drive that leverage ratio down over time.","On the second question, yes, that is the right way to think about CapEx, as you articulated. We think it's going to be about the same as 2015. And as you think about initial yields on invested capital, that would play out real closely to our guide and flow through of the growth in revenues flowing down to the EBITDA line.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC","All right. Thanks so much.","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","You bet.","Operator","Next we'll go to Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thank you. A couple of follow-ups. Throughout this year you saw a delay in the renewal activity, and it's pushed out to next year. I was wondering if you are having any conversation with the carriers today to potentially capture that churn for next year in maybe new MLAs that you could sign with them.","And then a follow-up on the CapEx side, can you talk about why maintenance CapEx is coming down next year, and how should we think about maintenance CapEx for the macro sites versus small cells? Thank you.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. In terms of specific conversations around renewals and MLAs, I'd tell you there's sort of nothing significant going on at the moment that merits commenting on, and the churn forecast, as we've laid out in the supplement, is sort or our best estimate of kind of where that's going.","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","On the second question around maintenance CapEx, it's primarily coming down because we saw during 2015 a meaningful portion of that maintenance CapEx being associated with additional office facilities as we were increasing the employment base for integrating the various assets that we've acquired recently. And so that's the reason for the reduction of about $25 million.","If you think about that reduction to where we're giving guidance for 2016, I would tell you about a third of that is corporate related roughly, and then the remaining balance would be on revenue-generating, both towers and small cells. That's probably \u2013 as you think about modeling it long term though, I would use 2016 as the run rate assumption, and absent any meaningful acquisitions that we do, that's probably a pretty good run rate for forecasting purposes.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Is the maintenance CapEx for small cells a bit higher than macro?","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP",">: No, it's actually a little bit lower. If you were thinking about it as a percent of revenues, which is probably the best way to think about it, it would actually be a little bit lower. Most of the maintenance, if you think about maintenance, would be in the direct operating expenses on the small cell side.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP",">: You bet.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Matt Heinz with Stifel.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. So, we certainly appreciated the opportunity to go into your Philly small cell network about a month ago, and definitely thought that that was \u2013 the three-tenant network was kind of illustrative of the longer-term potential of the business. But I was hoping you could just help us understand the competitive differentiation of your turnkey platform versus others in the market that may be more of just an on-net fiber oriented provider, or just a pure service provider without the fiber?","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Matt. And thanks for the comment on the Philly system. We were quite pleased with that. The majority of the work we're doing today is what we would call sort of full turnkey build out, where we're building the nodes and the fiber, as we talked about. There are some of our carrier customers, though, in fact different by market depending on what their individual capabilities are in a particular market, that are wanting to do some of that installation themselves, and essentially just contract with us for the fiber, on the same long-term contracted basis that we've talked about. And we're okay with that.","I mean, we're in business to monetize the investment and get a yield off co-location. And we'll accommodate however they want to go through it. We believe over time it will become more apparent that we have sort of unique expertise in what is continuing to be a challenging implementation and construction environment. It's not easy to do this stuff, and we've probably got the biggest team in the country doing this today. But clearly, there are different markets where different carriers want to undertake some of this themselves, and that's completely fine. And to the extent we can be helpful and let them utilize our component, being the fiber, we will do that. So that's kind of how the dynamic is shaping up in the market, and either way works for us.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then maybe just one follow-up on the small cells. I think we have a pretty good understanding now of what the up-front CapEx and returns look like. But I was hoping to get a better sense of what the ongoing capital intensity is, and maybe the useful life of the carrier equipment on the nodes, kind of in comparison to the traditional tower business?","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Sure. Initially, when we've built one on these systems, the operating expenses represent about 40% of the initial revenues. So, it's about 60% margins out of the gate there. As I mentioned in an earlier question on CapEx, there's very little ongoing maintenance CapEx associated with these systems. Most of the maintenance, if you think about it that way, would be embedded in that 40% of operating cost.","Over the longer term, the asset that we typically own in small cells would be the fiber asset. Most of that, as Ben mentioned earlier, is dark fiber. And then the other asset that we would own on the various locations where the tenants are putting their equipment, we would own a cabinet, often referred to as like a shroud, at the location, and the carriers would put the electronics inside of that cabinet or shroud.","We have seen already in the early days of the business the carriers come back and upgrade their electronics over time, but re-utilized the cabinet. So there's a pretty good parallel to what we see at the tower sites, in terms of reusing the infrastructure, the cabinets, if you will, or the shelters, and just upgrading the electronics inside. So we don't anticipate a meaningful amount of future CapEx or useful life degradation of the assets that we own. The carriers, we would expect over time to continue to put the capital in to replace their electronics and upgrade, very similar to what they do on the tower side.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Mike McCormack with Jefferies.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Not to beat the table too hard on the small cell stuff, but just getting a sense from you guys, if you would, on what you're seeing out there sort of on the ground as that gets deployed, as far as speed to market, is it pacing the way the carriers anticipated it would? And maybe any complexities or hurdles they've had to overcome in building that out?","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Mike. It's never fast enough. I'd be quick to speak for our carrier customers and say that they would tell us it's never fast enough. So that's the struggle we have every day, is that when they show up and engage us to build a system or co-locate on a system, it needs to be done sort of tomorrow. And the challenge we all have is that it's all new ground. It's new ground for us in certain markets, it's new ground for the carriers, they haven't done this themselves before either. And we're working through the various permitting and zoning and construction time lines that are required there.","So, I'd say we're getting better. We've done more than anybody in the marketplace, and we are certainly getting better and finding ways to gain days back in that cycle. But it's still, some of it is outside of our control. And to that end, we're continuing to work with municipalities and other jurisdictions to continue to gain access and the right of way as quickly as we possibly can.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","I mean, is that just sort of a blocking and tackling, building-by-building type of thing, Ben, or is it more widespread where you can do it and figure how...","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It depends on the jurisdiction, honestly. A lot of it is construction services, some markets are harder than others depending upon their affinity for wireless service, honestly, and whether or not they want to be supportive of additional wireless capacity in their market or not. And it's why we, a couple of years ago, three years ago, we got federal legislation, 6409 out of congress to help us mandate co-location on towers. It's incredible that that had to be a federal law, but it is.","And so, we're still dealing with some of that even at the micro level for small cells, and it's hard to understand why a community wouldn't want to promote wireless broadband in their community. But we're continuing to encounter that, and it's just something that's part of the business and we work through it.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.","Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just to take a step back, I was hoping you could articulate how you get from AFFO per share of 8% growth next year to your long-term targets of 6% to 7%. When I run some calculations, it looks like revenue growth should accelerate by about 100 basis points into 2017 and 2018 just from churn at PCS, LEAP and ClearWire ending. So, any color you can sort of provide on the puts and takes as to your long-term forecast would be really helpful.","Jay A. Brown - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Sure, Spencer. Appreciate the question. As we think about the 8% growth that we have going into 2016, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we expect about 1.5% of that is coming from the acquisition that we did in Sunesys. So on an organic basis, if you will, or a normalized basis, we've got about 6.5% to 6.6% growth coming out of the business.","You're right to note from the supplements that we've provided that churn comes down, and what we attempted to do when we set the long-term target of 6% to 7% AFFO per share growth rate, we tried to, as best we could, look at the landscape of all the things that could go positively for us, as well as negatively, into that number, and give you an all-in robust view of what would happen at the AFFO per share.","And our best estimates would include that runoff of churn, which we're certainly expecting, a non-renewal that you're illuminating. But we're also, as we think about interest rates in the business, we're running that model assuming the forward interest rate curve. So, we would assume that there will be some negative impact as rates rise over time, and that would, in essence, offset some of the benefits that we would expect to see over time from the non-renewals.","So, we're trying to, as best we can, give you an all-in view, a robust view as we think about modeling the business ourselves and running our corporate model. And so, there's some of that impact. There is one other thing that you should think about as you're modeling 2017, and think about the growth rate from 2016 to 2017. The preferred instrument that we did a couple of years back, that actually converts, mandatorily converts to equity at the end of 2016. That has a drag on growth and AFFO per share of about 100 basis points. So as the dividend goes away, if you will, which we're including currently as a deduction to AFFO, and then the shares go into the denominator of the number of shares outstanding, if you will.","So, that probably will help you bridge a little bit, and maybe some of the puts and takes you should think about to match your forecast closer to what we're thinking about long term.","Spencer H. Kurn - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we have time for maybe one more question this morning.","Operator","Okay. We'll go to Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thanks. I just wanted to go back to Amir's question, I think that was last hour. Your answer was extremely bullish on data growth. It's actually similar to what Malone has talked about, as far as we're going to need cell sites and small cells and Wi-Fi, everything. So I guess the question is, have you talked to the cable operators or Google about accessing your fiber for their Wi-Fi hotspots? I mean, it's a version of a small cell itself. I wonder if that dialogue has begun. Because if you believe in that future, which you guys obviously do, and I think others do as well, shouldn't those conversations be happening about now?","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Walter, all I'll say is we've talked to a lot of people about our fiber, and it's gotten attention from a lot of folks that we've got a significant amount of metro fiber holdings now, exactly in the places where you, as you've identified, people are going to want it. That goes back to the monetization of fiber question, and absolutely something we're looking at. I can't put anything in guidance today, and I'm not going to use any proper names about exactly who we're speaking to. But that's something over time that I think there's a revenue opportunity, and we've got...","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","But it's reasonable to assume that those dialogues are \u2013 I mean, I'm not asking you whether...","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it is. It is.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Yes. Okay. And then just one other question on \u2013 yeah. And one other question on small cells. If you think about the wireless \u2013 the four wireless operators, if there's upside next year in your small cell business specifically, do you suspect that it's going to be more from an existing guy getting more aggressive, or that that business model will extend to the operators that maybe are not as embracing of small cells?","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd say both. I'd say both.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's what happens.","W. Benjamin Moreland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, listen. We really wore everybody out this morning, and I appreciate those that have hung on the call. We wanted to make sure we got to everybody. Very much appreciate you joining us today. We're thrilled to death about this sort of first anniversary of raising the dividend as we have, 8% here today, which is very significant as we continue to differentiate our business model and our objectives going forward. We think it's a very compelling story, and we'll talk to you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."]}}
