[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Erickson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Erickson, you may begin.","David Erickson","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our third quarter 2014 financial results. During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today's call are: Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Scott Ullem, CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, our expectations regarding sales, gross profit margin, earnings per share, SG&A, R&D, interest expense, taxes, free cash flow and foreign currency impacts. These statements also include our current expectations for the timing, status and expected outcomes of our clinical trials, regulatory compliance, submissions and approvals, as well as expectations regarding industry growth, portfolio adjustments, conversions, new products, competitive positions and reimbursement.","These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Although we believe them to be reasonable, these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or experiences to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences may be found in our press release, our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and our other SEC filings, which are available on our website at edwards.com.","Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying, excluding special items and adjusted for special items, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release and on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem","Thank you, David. This quarter, we are pleased with the results in all product groups and regions, with strong double-digit overall sales growth. This was highlighted by transcatheter heart valve sales that exceeded our expectations driven by the strong adoption of this therapy. In Europe, the U.S. and Japan, the launches of SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN XT are strengthening our global leadership position and allowing a greater number of patients to benefit from this life-saving therapy.","Also during the quarter, we began implementing several adjustments to our portfolio, driven by our strategic planning process. These include: Combining the operations of our Cardiac Surgery Systems and Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product lines; the redeployment of glucose monitoring resources into our Enhanced Surgical Recovery initiative; as well as increasing investment in advanced structural heart opportunities.","Now turning to the quarterly specifics. Total adjusted sales were $589 million, representing an underlying growth rate of 19%. In transcatheter valves, underlying global sales grew 44% driven by strong growth in all regions. U.S. sales accounted for approximately half of our total THV sales. U.S. and Europe sales exceeded our expectations as adoption grew faster than we anticipated and our new product launches reinforced our leadership position. Our global average selling price was unchanged from a year ago.","Outside the U.S., THV sales grew 42% on an underlying basis, once again driven by strong market growth in Europe. SAPIEN 3 is now representing more than 75% of our European THV sales, gained ground across the region and continues to enjoy very positive clinician feedback. Clinicians have rapidly converted to SAPIEN 3, and we expect it to be available in all of our sites by the end of the year. Although the impact of newer competitors in Europe was limited again this quarter, we are continuing to see a modest pickup in their penetration. In Japan, THV sales in the quarter grew to $11 million. While clinicians there are enthusiastic about our SAPIEN XT valve, the procedural success remains very high. The site certification process is gaining the pace of adoption in the near term. We continue to expect SAPIEN XT sales in Japan to be between $40 million and $50 million for 2014, and believe the opportunity for transcatheter technology for these patients is very attractive.","In the U.S., underlying THV sales were $126 million for the quarter, including $10 million from royalties and excluding the benefit of a net $17 million sales return reserve reversal. This represents an underlying growth rate of 46% compared to the $86 million reported last year. Included in this quarter's results were lower clinical sales than we recorded in the second quarter and approximately $16 million of negative impact from net stocking. The number of TAVR procedures in the U.S. grew more rapidly than we expected. Additionally, our performance was driven by the adoption of our lower-profile SAPIEN XT and strong demand for our larger 29-millimeter valve. By the end of the quarter, we had shipped SAPIEN XT to all of our sites and expect conversion to be largely completed by year-end. We remain on track with our previously stated goal to add 45 to 65 new sites during 2014.","On the reimbursement front, 2 new DRGs for all endovascular valve replacement procedures, including TAVR, went into effect on October 1. In adopting the new code, CMS acknowledged that TAVR patients are different from typical surgical valve patients, and the new DRGs will more accurately reflect the level of hospital resources required. Our modeling suggests this change will result in an improvement in TAVR hospital economics.","Enrollment in our U.S. SAPIEN 3 trial of 1,000 intermediate-risk patients was completed last month. As a reminder, we completed enrollment of the high-risk trial in January of this year, which has a 1 year end point. Based on our estimates, we're planning for a first approval of SAPIEN 3 in 2016. At the same time, we're actively engaging with FDA to discuss ways to bring our latest technology to patients more quickly. We are also discussing with FDA a limited continued access protocol for SAPIEN 3. We'll provide updates on our SAPIEN time lines at our Investor Conference in December.","In summary, we are very pleased with our global THV sales performance, which exceeded our expectations. Going forward, we believe current market growth rates are not sustainable and expect competitive activity will increase. Given the expected reduction in U.S. clinical sales and the recent FX headwinds in the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted sales dollars to be roughly comparable to the third quarter. We now expect our full year 2014 underlying THV sales growth rate to be around 25%.","Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Sales were $203 million, up 6% on an underlying basis. Solid unit growth was seen across all regions, and product mix drove a slightly higher overall ASP. Globally, surgical valve sales grew 7%, led by unit growth of our premium valves. We believe that global surgical valve procedures continue to grow in the low single digits this quarter.","In Europe, strong unit growth was driven by building clinician interest in INTUITY Elite, our minimally invasive valve platform. And in Japan, our growth rate has rebounded following competitive introductions over the past few years.","At the recent European cardiac surgery meeting, there were multiple presentations on the INTUITY valve platform, which included 3-year data from the TRITON CE mark trial, clinical data from the foundation registry of 512 patients and follow-up on the randomized cadence MIS series. These data demonstrated differentiated clinical performance, increased rates of minimally invasive surgery and improved patient outcomes. We believe this investment in INTUITY evidence will continue to support the growing adoption of this platform around the world. In the U.S., we are on track to complete patient enrollment in our TRANSFORM Trial for INTUITY Elite by the end of the year. As a reminder, we report our Cardiac Surgery Systems or CSS product line in the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group.","In our Utah-based CSS operations, we've taken actions to enhance our long-term performance, and those are impacting our near-term results. We continue to aggressively focus resources on addressing the items identified in the warning letter, and the extensive CSS remediation efforts are proceeding on track. And additionally, as part of this action, we're planning to exit nonstrategic products, representing annual sales of $10 million to $20 million.","Separately, we made the strategic decision to integrate the operations of our surgical heart valve and CSS product lines. We are focusing our investments in surgical structural heart therapies that combine an implant, MIS products and training that we can support with clinical evidence. We believe this combination will better serve patients, strengthen our surgeon partnerships and extend our leadership. The integration is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Combined, we expect these actions to have a modest negative impact on the top line over the next year, with some expense savings from operational efficiencies, offset by increased investments in our quality organization and advanced structural heart projects. These are long-term strategic adjustments to better position us to deliver new therapies for structural heart patients.","In summary, despite the disruption on -- in our CSS product line, we're continuing to experience strength in our surgical valve product line, and still expect underlying sales growth for the total product group to be at the low end of our previous 4% to 7% range in 2014.","Turning to the Critical Care product group. Total sales for the quarter grew 4.5% on an underlying basis to $137 million. Sales performance was solid across the board, and we again experienced double-digit ESR product sales growth globally. As a reminder, ESR, or Enhanced Surgical Recovery, is designed to enhance patient outcomes and facilitate shorter hospital stays resulting from better monitoring and fluid management. These ESR products include both minimally and noninvasive monitoring sensors such as FloTrac and ClearSight.","ESR is a significant opportunity that we are well positioned to lead, and we believe it will help even more patients, and grow our Critical Care franchise. This rapidly evolving space requires investment and innovation, so we have recently made the difficult decision to refocus resources from our continuous glucose monitoring program to ESR. Although we've been successful in developing and commercializing our GlucoClear technology, there was still a significant effort needed to change clinical practice.","Separately, as you may have heard, Carlyn Solomon, our corporate Vice President of Critical Care, has made the personal decision to leave Edwards to pursue another opportunity. We respect his decision and express our sincere thanks to Carlyn for his many contributions as a valued member of our executive leadership team, and we wish him the very best in the future endeavors. We are actively engaged in identifying a successor.","To summarize our Critical Care product line, we are pleased with a strong results to date and continuing adoption of ESR products. Therefore, we continue to expect underlying sales growth in Critical Care to be at the high end of our previous 3% to 6% range. We're continuing to make progress on our FORTIS transcatheter mitral program. Heart teams in 4 countries have been trained in our -- on our technology, and 11 patients have been treated to date. In addition to the compassionate use patients, we're continuing our first in-human experience in a European and Canadian multicenter, protocol-driven prospective study. The purpose of this study is to continue our feasibility work in patients who are at high risk for surgery, and to enhance our understanding about patient selection.","Although the journey to commercialization may be a long one, and durable success will not be known without significantly more experience, we continue to believe transcatheter technologies can help address the large need among patients with mitral valve disease and expect clinical results to be reported at future medical meetings. And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott B. Ullem","Thanks, Mike. Third quarter adjusted sales of $589 million exceeded the top end of our guidance range by about 3% and represented 19% underlying growth over last year. Our strong sales performance in transcatheter valves drove non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.80, which was above the top end of our guidance. This represented 14% growth over the prior year, which includes increased incentive compensation associated with the higher sales and increased expenses associated with the portfolio adjustments Mike just mentioned. I'll cover the detail behind these top line and bottom line results and then share guidance for the balance of the year.","Edwards reported GAAP sales in the third quarter of $607 million. Our adjusted sales of $589 million exclude the benefit associated with the transcatheter valve sales return reserve reversal. The next generation product exchanges are almost completed in the U.S. and in Europe, and we expect to reverse the remaining $4 million of net reserve in the fourth quarter. The sales return reserve schedule on our Investor Relations website has been updated to reflect this quarter's results.","For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 72.3% compared to 74.1% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven primarily by a 160 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, and also 140 basis points of higher costs associated with our CSS operations in Utah. This reduction was partially offset by a more profitable product mix. For the fourth quarter, we expect our gross profit margin, excluding special items, to be approximately 74% as the impact of foreign exchange mitigates.","Second quarter selling, general and administrative expenses were $222 million or 37.7% of adjusted sales, compared to $178 million in the prior year. The largest components of the increase were driven by our transcatheter valve sales performance, including larger accruals for sales commissions and incentive compensation, which primarily impacts SG&A expense. Incentive compensation also impacts, to a lesser extent, our cost of sales and research and development expenses.","For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 37% and 38% of sales. We continue to aggressively invest in research and development, and spending in the third quarter was $88 million or 14.9% of adjusted sales, compared to $84 million in the prior year period. This increase was primarily the result of additional investments in aortic and mitral valve programs. We expect fourth quarter R&D investments as a percent of sales to be comparable to the third quarter.","During the third quarter, we recorded 3 adjustments to our GAAP results, which reduced our net income by $7.6 million as follows: first, the impact of the THV Sales Return Reserve benefited our GAAP net income by $11.6 million. Consistent with prior quarters, we excluded this impact from our non-GAAP net income; second, we excluded from our non-GAAP results the cost associated with the write-down of assets related to our glucose program. $2 million of these costs are included in our cost of sales, and $3 million were reflected as a special charge; and third, consistent with prior quarters, we excluded $900,000 of intellectual property litigation expense from our non-GAAP results. A complete reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP net income was included in our press release.","Net interest expense for the quarter increased from the prior year to $2.5 million, primarily as a result of our $600 million issuance of 5-year notes last October. For the full year 2014, we continue to expect net interest expense to be at the low end of our $12 million to $15 million range. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 21.6%, down from 23.0% in the prior year. This quarter's favorable rate resulted primarily from an improvement in our European tax position, partially offset by higher sales of transcatheter valves in the U.S. We expect our rate will drop to approximately 16% in the fourth quarter, assuming renewal of the federal research and development tax credit.","FX rates had a negligible impact on sales compared to the prior year. Compared to our prior guidance, FX rates had an approximate $0.01 impact on earnings per share. Given the weakening of the yen and the euro, at current rates, there will be additional foreign exchange drag on sales in the fourth quarter of approximately $15 million.","Free cash flow generated during the quarter was a negative $6 million, which included a $159 million tax payment related to the prior quarter's litigation settlement. We define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities of $12 million, less capital spending of $18 million.","Excluding the tax impacts of the prior quarter's litigation settlement payment and of our contribution to the Edwards Lifesciences fund, free cash flow was $139 million. For 2014, excluding special items, we now expect free cash flow to be at the high end of our previous range of $325 million to $425 million.","Turning to our sales and earnings guidance. As Mike mentioned earlier, given our strong performance in transcatheter valves, we now expect sales in this product group to exceed the high end of our previous range of $830 million to $900 million, and total company sales to exceed the high end of our previous range of $2.05 billion to $2.25 billion. For the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy group, we continue to expect sales of $810 million to $850 million. And in the Critical Care product group, we continue to expect sales of $535 million to $575 million.","We estimate fourth quarter diluted shares outstanding to be between 109 million and 110 million. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we project total sales to be between $575 million and $615 million, which reflects the additional expected foreign exchange headwinds. We expect diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be between $0.89 and $0.95, which increases our full year guidance for the diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to a range of $3.33 to $3.39. And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks, Scott. Our strong year-to-date results reinforce our conviction in our focused innovation strategy and point to a bright future for Edwards Lifesciences. Although competition is intensifying, we believe our pipeline of new products positions us well to drive solid organic sales growth and help clinicians address critical unmet patient needs. We are encouraged the new therapies, supported by compelling evidence, are still being adopted even in this challenging health care climate. And with that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David Erickson","Thank you, Mike. Before we open up for questions, I would like to remind you to RSVP for our 2014 investor conference on Monday, December 8, in New York. This event will include updates on our new technologies as well as our outlook for 2015. More information and a registration form are available on our website. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted just to start with maybe your helping us with any detail you can provide on how things have changed in the transcatheter valve market over the past, call it, 10 months. When we started at your Analyst Meeting last December, I think you painted a fairly conservative or, some might say, bleak picture for your business as well as the overall market and over the course of the year, things have gone better. So can you maybe just help us understand specifically what has changed in the market and in your own business on a year-to-date basis?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks David, good question. I think back at the Investor Conference, we acknowledged that we thought that there would be a pretty good growth rate in transcatheter heart valves globally. I want to say we projected a 25% to 30% growth rate for the market. But we said, it was going to be a difficult year to call, because we had a new competitor in the U.S. We had new competitors coming in to Europe and at the same time, we had product launches coming from Edwards, and that led to a very broad range of outcomes. As things have played out, probably the thing that's most significant is that we find the markets growing faster than we anticipated. It's growing faster in Europe than we thought, it's growing faster in the U.S. than we thought. And you couple that with what I feel are very successful launches of SAPIEN 3 in Europe and SAPIEN XT in the U.S., and that's really resulted in a performance better than we expected.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then as you think about the comment on both on the call and in the press release about the new competition coming, it's, I think very reasonable for all of us to understand why growth at the level you put up this quarter is not likely sustainable. But that sort of begs to reason that a lot of what we thought might have been onetime in nature, this year, whether there's trialing of new products, or a bounce back in a certain market. And what gets this market going again from here, and sort of reinforces the longer-term view in that 2014 wasn't just an easy bounce-back year?","Michael A. Mussallem","Well, I think the growth of the market sort of speaks for itself. As I said, I feel like it's growing faster than we had originally anticipated, so this isn't just versus a weak comparison. The market is, it's really growing. And I think there's a number of reasons why the market is growing faster than we originally anticipated, but it is. So the competition is coming. There's no doubt about that. We expect that to intensify, but this quarter was not really one that was one-timers that drove this. This is underlying market growth and good performance by our product groups.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then maybe last one for me. Just thinking about how that translates then down the income statement. Scott, I understand that the specifics around incentive comp and the better sales. But what does it take to restore operating leverage to the model, whereby we can get back to a point where EBIT is growing faster than revenue, call it, on an annual basis?","Michael A. Mussallem","Well, thanks, David. We have to let others ask questions after this, then.","Scott B. Ullem","Okay, David, this is something we're looking very hard at. Obviously, as we getting ready for our December conference in New York, we'll tell you more about what 2015 holds. But I can tell you that we're looking at how we can try to streamline our operations. We've got a lot of expenses running through the P&L in the third quarter, relating to CSS operations. Some of those will go away in the future. A lot of those will continue and get baked into enhancing our quality programs. But it's something that we're focused on keenly, and we'll talk more about that in December.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Advisers.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'll ask my 2 questions together here, and they're actually follow-ups on David's questions. So Mike, what is temporary about the current market growth rates? Was there pent-up demand, for example, for the 29-millimeter valve? What -- could you be more specific about what caused the sudden acceleration that we saw? And the second question is, on the new competition intensifying, could you be more specific, is it the U.S.? Is it Europe? Because you seemed to be doing very well in Europe with SAPIEN 3.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, Larry. Yes, in terms of what is lifting the market, there are a number of factors that we believe sort of have lifted the market, and we probably underestimated these. The availability of these new 18 French delivery systems have just provided for much more transfemoral delivery and that's -- and that equals, in general, a less-invasive procedure and shorter recovery times. The larger valves have been significant, and that's really contributed to volume. The improving economics, I think, has -- have been seen by our sites, and that is no longer a drag. And just, I think the confidence in the long-term outcomes continues to grow as those results get reported and they continue to the favorable. So that's sort of a high-level summary. It is possible that we are seeing a bolus of patients with 29-millimeter valves. I think we probably sold about, I think, something in the neighborhood of 1 quarter of the valves that we sold in the quarter were 29-millimeter valves. That's a little higher than we were when we were -- had the XT product in Europe, and so there may be some of that, that we're experiencing, Larry, so that's sort of the key thing. In terms of new competition, I think, we know that in the U.S., that Medtronic is still rolling out their product. They're probably in more than half of our accounts. They're still ramping up, so we, I think we're yet to feel their full effect. And we know that St. Jude has been out of the marketplace, companies like Boston Scientific and Scimed are still building up their presence. So we just expect it to generally intensify.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Mike, I wanted to follow up on your FDA comments, and I understand it's a hard question to answer. But any color, granularity, sense of optimism you could share with us incrementally on either an acceleration of the intermediate-risk label or bringing SAPIEN 3 to the U.S.? And I've got one quick follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Brooks. Really, I don't have anything to share at this point. Of course, we're optimists by nature, but we know from experience that trying to predict early FDA actions is not something that's prudent. And so we'll certainly update you at the Investor Conference of what we learn. We are in discussions with the FDA. We do ask them about accelerating the new product approvals. We are asking them about a limited continued access program, and we just don't have those answers right now.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then, just a quick one for Scott. FX, I think you gave the dollar amount, top line. Did you give the hit to EPS for Q4?","Scott B. Ullem","For Q4, the hit to EPS, we haven't talked about yet. It's difficult to predict what it's going to be, because we don't know where FX is going to go.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Wondered if I could ask, start in the U.S. and for my 2 questions, in terms of the dynamics you're seeing amongst the hospitals here, are you seeing a deeper penetration in those bigger hospitals, or are you seeing sort of a broadening of the utilization at this point?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Raj. We're really seeing it pretty broadly. It's been across the board. We are seeing increased penetration in the larger accounts, but we're also seeing it in smaller accounts. So we're sort of -- it feels like everything was going our way right now.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then within that, is there any insight into what types of patients you're seeing? Has there been this progression down the severity curve as one might expect? Or is it still largely on label at this point, do you think?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I still feel like we're very much seeing high-risk patients and that we're not seeing risk creep. When we look at the average age of patients, that continues to be in the same range as it has been in the past where it's in the 80s. That's what we've seen out of the TVT registry, so. It's still there. I think there's a, there may be different views on the part of heart teams as they're judging these patients, but now we still think we're clearly in the high-risk category. It's difficult, because I know people use, they want to use the SPS score, which is not a great risk score for transcatheter heart valve patients. And so that's still something that's evolving. You still have frailty that's part of this, so. Right now, I think, you have heart teams doing the best they can.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","If I could just squeeze one in on Europe. You mentioned this idea of competition. And I'm curious what you're seeing thus far in terms of how hospitals are adopting the technology. You're seeing hospitals primarily bringing in one large vendor, either yourselves or Medtronic, and then maybe one of the smaller ones, or is it a little more diffused than that, where they might allow both yourselves and Medtronic in, just anything in terms of how you're seeing that market develop would be helpful.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I would say the majority of our accounts have more than one supplier, and that there be a very small, I would say, I don't know, must be, and I'm guessing now that under 20% of our accounts would be exclusive Edwards, maybe less than 10%. So in general, the customers would have a choice on their shelf.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Just trying to get at the EU market growth from a different angle, while that London valve, hearing a couple of things. How much of your acceleration in Europe is Edwards' German market share gain? I'm hearing about dramatic gains there as competitors, obviously you're making some of your larger competitors -- have yet to launch a broad array of sizes. And how much of the growth in Europe has been moved to intermediate-risk patients in Europe, which seems significant?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, so a couple of things, Rick. The -- I think I mentioned in our opening comments that it -- we saw growth in -- pretty much in all countries across Europe. Of course, Germany is the largest country, and so that tends to be outsized in terms of the dollars, but the growth rate was strong in all countries. In terms of what's driving it, there's a few things. Of course, there's a growing body of evidence, and you have to believe the fact that people are being successfully treated and that, that is driving a referral base to be more positive is helpful. I also believe that the new devices further improve outcomes for patients, and that's accelerated the growth of procedures. In terms of going into the intermediate risk, I don't think that's typical. I mean, one of the things worth noting is the -- looking at the growth rate of our surgical heart valve business. It's been very nice in Europe, and so I really don't think that you're -- what you're watching here is a cannibalization effect.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And just one other follow-up on the -- your comments about combining, integrating the rest of the part of the business, and I heard your comments about building a separate structural heart company. I'm just trying to understand how we think about this longer term. Are you thinking about creating a separate structural heart company? Is that Edwards? Or are you thinking about spinning it off or selling it? Is that how we should think about the long run here? Any color would be grateful.","Michael A. Mussallem","No, I'm sorry. Maybe my comments weren't clear. So here was what I was trying to say. Reported under the surgical heart valve products group were -- are 2 individual organizations, one that did Cardiac Surgery Systems, which largely made tools that were used by clinicians. Some of them MIS tools, some of them tools we'd use doing open heart, and the other part of that would be heart valves. So we've decided to combine those 2 organizations. And what we are trying to project here is, that selling tools for minimally invasive procedures, we don't think is as good a strategy as actually being able to introduce a therapy that includes a valve and the tools and us being able to back it up with training and clinical evidence. So that's the direction we're going in, and we have some things in our advanced technology area. We're actually making investments in structural heart innovations that are promising. And so we're continuing to fund those and move those along. We certainly have an idea of keeping those inside Edwards Lifesciences, that's core to our focused strategy, and if those are successful, we'll have something to talk about. But for the most part, those are still early-stage programs at this point, and we'll update you as we make some progress. Does that make sense? Yes?","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Fair enough. Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, based on our guess, as to a Medtronic report, the market this quarter year-over-year in the U.S. could have doubled. And I guess, could you just help us think about, that the original segmentation of the surgically eligible population that fit in the NCD was really based on NCD score, or STS scores. Now it doesn't seem -- the STS score is an imperfect measure. I mean, like, how many of the -- what percent of the people, who are in fact surgically eligible do you think, really kind of fit into the NCD, given a kind of more liberal definition of high risk?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, Bruce, I know you and others are very good at modeling this. And we believe that there's a very large number of patients with severe aortic stenosis and symptoms that go untreated today, and there's a whole variety of reasons. And we believe that this transcatheter technology is broadly bringing them off the sidelines. And that, that's the single biggest thing that's going on. This is a group that traditionally had not been well studied, and we're all learning more about them right now, but I still believe that, that opportunity is very large, and that we're still in low numbers in terms of a penetration rate. We're going to learn more about it, frailty matters. Right now, it is difficult to use risk scores to try and define who's in the market and who's out of it. People that are frail, people that have had radiation and a hostile chest, they have lower risk scores, but they are perfect candidates for this therapy. That'd be a great example of that. So we're still learning and as I said, we didn't predict the growth rate this quarter either. So this is one that came as news to us.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And just switching topics. You mentioned that you're kind of moving into protocol-driven exploration of FORTIS. Do you have any feel yet, just qualitatively, which side the questions really remaining on, whether FORTIS is a workable design or really the effort going forward is really to find out which of the patients are best served by a transcatheter mitral replacement technology?","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks, Bruce, good question. And the fact is we're still on a steep, steep learning curve. We -- I think we mentioned early on in the FORTIS program, if we found something that was dramatic, we might consider just stopping the FORTIS program. But obviously, we didn't see anything dramatically negative. And we're continuing to think that it's promising, and we've had some results that have gone on for a while here. We're, so we're anxious to learn just how capable the FORTIS design is. At the same time, our initial treatment of these compassionate patients was certainly a pretty desperate group, not a good way to identify what the real applicability of this therapy is. And so right now, being able to move into a high-risk surgical population is really important to us, and we'll look forward to being able to see those results and report them to you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Clearly, all of us are trying to ascertain from your strong results just how we're going to model going forward. And also, obviously, you're not willing, at this time, to give 2015 guidance. So just -- I was wondering if I could ask you from a qualitative standpoint, as you look at the geographies, over the course of the next 18 months, U.S., Europe and Japan specifically, and think in terms of growth rates relative to where we're likely to end up this year. Looking at those 3 geographies, where do you think you'll see some growth augmentation, if you will, from growth rates going higher and perhaps in Germany, Medtronic has talked about being behind the eight ball because of the injunction earlier and suggested perhaps they'll get better in Germany next year, whether or not Europe, we should be looking at growth rates slowing down a little bit. And then the U.S. obviously, given the results today, it's tough to tell. So just wondering qualitatively, if you look at those 3 geographies over the course of the next 18 months, where do you see growth accelerate and growth decelerate, in your mind?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks Jason. First, a few qualitative comments. Overall, the fact that Europe is still growing at this stage of the game 7 years after introduction, we find pretty remarkable, and we're very pleased with that, and this is without very much indication expansion. The U.S. is obviously still adopting, and the advent of these new systems really seem to have accelerated the growth rate and the additional sizes as well. And Japan is just beginning. And again, we think that probably gets off to a slow start in general, but gains a lot of momentum. Having said that, we're not very good at predicting how this goes on a quarterly basis, and probably are better to think about this on a long-term basis. We believe that the long-term growth rate for the globe is probably in this 15% to 20% growth rate. And we think that, that is one that we still feel comfortable with. We felt that way for some time, and we believe that this will continue to evolve this way. But I hesitate to hazard a guess on what various regions are going to grow in the near term.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","That's helpful color. In the U.S., I believe pre-XT, your transapical to transfemoral mix was about 50-50. I wondering if you can correct me on that if I'm wrong. And I'm sorry if I missed it, I've been jumping between calls, but did you give that number, that mix number for Q3, and sort of now, what you might expect on a go-forward basis over the longer term in the U.S.?","Michael A. Mussallem","I missed the start of the question, Jason, were you asking about the U.S. or Europe?","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Yes, U.S., Mike, sorry.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. The U.S., right now, we feel like we've moved to about 75% transfemoral with XT. And so that means about 25% is this, is some other kinds of access. We expect this to probably continue, similar to that range based on our past experience.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Mike, sorry to harp on this market growth issue, but just curious as to why the bearish commentary when we, to your point, haven't necessarily accessed the intermediate risk patient population, even, necessarily in Europe, that's still coming on line here in the U.S., hopefully in the coming years, reimbursements improving. So, I guess, what's the right way to think about sustainable market growth if not at current rate, but what's the right level? Because we do have a lot of runway, I would think, considering intermediate risk potentially doubles the market opportunity. How do we reconcile that with the commentary today?","Michael A. Mussallem","Again, Danielle, I just get nervous about taking a specific quarter like the last one, which was just a terrific growth rate and extrapolating that. I feel like it's better to take a look at a long-term perspective, as I say, globally, this long-term, 15% to 20% perspective is a safer way to look at it. What we experienced this last quarter, we just don't think is sustainable as a market growth rate, and we do believe the competitive activity. So I'm not trying to be bearish, I'm just trying to be realistic about the outlook for Edwards.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And one follow-up, unrelated. But just on the GlucoClear program, based on the commentary today on the asset write-down, is it fair to assume that, that program is now dead? Or what's going on with that program?","Michael A. Mussallem","We're still discussing what might happen with that program. We do think it's very valuable. We accomplished a great deal. We have a commercial product, clear path to commercialization in the U.S., a CE mark in Europe, and so we're considering strategic options in that, including partnering.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Can you maybe update us on the contribution, in terms of the retraining efforts you've been undertaking with clinics, to help them speed the process of moving patients through? Is that something that's kind of ongoing? Could that kind be contributing, and is that maybe an additional driver as you broaden that? Or is that largely played out at this point?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Ben. No I -- we see a high level of variability in terms of how well specific hospitals develop their referral base. It's ongoing. But one of the things that hospitals do is they have a, they really work on their length of stay, and trying to improve their economics. But the -- but other hospitals have really invested resources in developing their referral base, and trying to get out there and educating people about the value of TAVR and to try and capture the patients that really could be helped by this therapy, but might go untreated because for some reason, that is just -- not appropriate. If we just treated people within guidelines, there would be many more patients flowing into the system. So I would say it's still a young program. It's one that's developing. I like to think that the DRG changes generally are positive and encourage hospitals to hopefully even put more resources into this.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then my follow-up is, how hard are you having to work to get clinicians on the referral side to push patients in? Is that just taking on its own kind of momentum at this point? Or is that an area where you're actively investing?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks. We probably have limited impact on really being able to do much with that. We can -- awareness is growing, but you have a pretty good handle on what's going on out there in terms of consolidations, the developing -- the development of narrow networks and so forth. And so you have more and more systems that are really trying to put their arms around groups of patients and keep them within their system, and so you got a high level of variability that's taking place out there, but Edwards does not have a major role in that -- in the development of how those patients flow.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mike, maybe just changing gears for a second here. We think about this particular quarter, you announced a divestiture, a product shutdown and actually division integration or segment integration. I guess the question I have is, is why now? It's a fair amount of transformation in light of tremendous operational excellence, so no one's going to accuse you of not walking and chewing gum. But why now? And in a business that I think everyone's been very focused on, from a transformation perspective actually has been Critical Care, and there is sort of no mention of that. So a lot of transformation, why now, and what are your thoughts on Critical Care? And I have a follow-up for Scott.","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks, David. For you and others that have been following us for a long time, you know that we have made a serious and continuous part of the way we manage our company, to actively manage our portfolio. And over the years, we've consistently walked away from things that we did not think have a bright future, and try and add things that we thought our customers would really welcome from us. And so there's been a constant transformation of the portfolio. The primary adjustments that we are making right now are -- actually one of them did touch Critical Care. We say a redeployment of resources from continuous glucose monitoring into Enhanced Surgical Recovery. That's a significant shift for us. There was a -- that's a significant amount of R&D that's going to move over. This idea of moving together, the surgical heart valve operations with the Cardiac Surgery Systems operations and taking some of the efficiencies that come from that and being able to invest in new structural heart programs is also a key part of our strategy. And we just think that those are prudent moves that build long-term value. We would be doing that just in terms of the right thing to do for the long-term growth of our company. It's kind of independent of what's going on. We're obviously enjoying a level of success that allows us to be able to fund those changes in the near term.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just quick question for Scott. I mean, Scott, the so-called focusing on the top line. It's pretty clear that the, the bull case for the Edwards top line is certainly coming into investor focus here. So the natural question here is leverage. And I'm wondering if you could talk me out of a couple of notions here. It looks like your absolute level of R&D spending is continuing -- is beginning to ebb, and you've got a significant revenue base to leverage off of, and your TAVR business is certainly going to pop through 40% as business mix heads to next year. So can you kind of talk me off of a notion why absolute R&D spending should not slow, and why margin trajectory on the gross margin side should not be higher or if not materially higher in '15 and '16, based on these trends we're seeing.","Scott B. Ullem","So R&D expenses in the quarter went to $88 million, up from $84 million. So we're going to continue to grow and invest in research and development. It's a little bit lumpy, because a big chunk of our R&D expenses is in clinical trials, and those expenses hit at various given periods. In terms of gross margins, we expect that gross margins are going to improve. The biggest driver of the volatility or shift in gross margins is foreign exchange. And obviously, that's difficult to predict. We had 160 basis point headwind in this quarter, and we think that will mitigate going forward, but we're really focused on gross margin. It's directly tied to our sense of whether we get a return on those R&D investments that we're making.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just to follow up on David's question there. I might ask it just a little bit differently. At what point do you guys think you'll be comfortable giving some longer-term guidance? And then, and the primary reason I ask is that, most MedTech companies with the kind of momentum that you're showing, ultimately do get to operating margins that are above 30%. And so, I'm wondering: one, at what point might you consider giving some long-term guidance; and two, is there some structural reason why long-term you think you might not be able to get there?","Scott B. Ullem","Look, we recognize that other companies give longer term guidance. We'll give our 1-year guidance in December. Really, at this point, it's tough to put a bead on where transcatheter heart valves are going. And so to project out further than 4 quarters is difficult for us to do with any sense of accuracy. We're a long way away from a 30% operating margin. And we are, as I said before, keenly focused on trying to get leverage out of the income statement. We think we will over time, as on a percentage basis, R&D and SG&A will come down, because the sales line will continue to grow well. But we're focused on it, but it's not going to be an immediate shift in our overall income statement profile. It ought to be over the longer term.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I'm just wondering again, it's not -- wasn't really a question about this quarter or next year, really, I'm just wondering if, for some reason, structurally you think that, that's not a level you could achieve if you continue to have success. And so maybe if you can comment on that. And then the last question I want to ask, because really just, Mike, if you just could give us a quick sense, in terms of the success in the TAVR sales outside United States. Do you think that's really entirely market? Or do you think this is maybe a quarter where you also potentially took substantial share?","Scott B. Ullem","Yes, I'll try to answer the structural question. Now look, structurally, we expect that we are going to continue to improve our operating margins. And I can't predict that we're going to get to 30% at some point down the road, but we really are trying to get leverage out of the income statement. It'll take a little while to get there, but there aren't any structural impediments to improving the profitability ratios.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, and Bob, we had a pretty terrific growth rate outside the U.S., as I mentioned. Some of that is Japan, but the bulk of that came out of Europe. The biggest lift we got was related to what we believe is the market growing faster. Mike, we have gained share -- we might have, but we really don't, aren't able to say that with any level of precision. Our largest competitor reports in an off quarter for us, so it's hard for us to be able to do the exact math on that. And now that we have multiple, smaller players as well, it gets more challenging for us to nail market shares. But yes, we believe we probably improved our competitive position in the quarter as well.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'll add to all the different words you've used to describe the quarter, but obviously very, very strong. Let me just clarify 2 items. Mike, the TFTA split that you gave earlier, was that the market in your view, or is that Edwards ?","Michael A. Mussallem","No, that was us, Mike. Thanks for the comment by the way.","Michael A. Mussallem","The 75-25 split was Edwards. I would guess that our competitor would be even higher transfemoral, but I don't -- I can't speak to that with certainty.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And then, I just wanted to pursue the money shift within -- where you're moving money out of the glucose monitoring to ESR, and you're increasing the investment in advance structural heart opportunities, and I was hoping you could help describe for us what are advanced structural heart opportunities outside of the mitral replacement device.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Well, actually, the transcatheter mitral opportunity is one of those places where we'll be increasing investment. In addition to that, we just think broadly in the area of structural heart, that technology is available to be able to treat structural heart disease with interventional or minimally invasive technologies. And this could impact any of the valve positions, and it could even move into patients that suffer from heart failure. And we're not going to be specific on what we're working on, but we have multiple programs that are in our advanced technology area, where we're pursuing opportunities, and we're hopeful that some of those come to fruition. There is some promise there, but still early.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just last question on that. So are those all internal programs, and are any of them in-humans that you could talk about?","Michael A. Mussallem","They're -- most of them are internal, but we also have some external programs. And in general, we'll keep you updated. When they tend to move into humans, you'll hear about them reported at medical meetings.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, our final question will be coming from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, one for Mike and one for Scott. Mike, just to follow up on mitral, it seems like there's some smaller competitors that seem to be starting some more formalized trials, and you're moving to a little bit of a formalized trial with your Europe and Canadian first-in-man experience. So I'm just wondering, as you look at the landscape, where do you feel you are, competitive-wise? Do you feel like you're in line with some of the smaller players that are starting more formal trials? Or do you feel like you're a little bit behind? And then, Scott, you mentioned your free cash flow for the year's going to be at the high end of the range. You are buying back stock, but you're not buying back stock aggressively. So how should we think about use of cash going forward, as your cash pile continues to build?","Michael A. Mussallem","All right, thanks, Glen, I'll answer your first question. Yes, it's a tough one to call about who's ahead at this very, very early stage. I mean, most of us all just have a small number of patients. And as you correctly noted, some of us are into some more formal studies. But those are still small studies. And so, and I think, it's -- it remains to be seen, sort of who's in front on that sort of dimension. I can tell you that Edwards Lifesciences has an intention to be the leader in transcatheter mitral technologies, but that's for us to work on and deliver.","Scott B. Ullem","And regarding the share purchase, I'll just start with cash usage in general. Our first call on cash is investing in high-returning, internal organic growth opportunities. We are -- we look at outside investments as well. External acquisition opportunities are generally small. And minority investments, joint ventures, buying intellectual property, but that's an important direction for our cash usage as well. And then share repurchase is going to be the biggest use of cash. And we're going to, over time, be an aggressive repurchaser of shares, as we have been historically. But we also want to make sure that we dollar cost average, and that we make sure we're tracking over the -- overall macroeconomic and big picture stock market moves, so that we have a chance to spread out our repurchases, and that's what we're going to plan to do.","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks, Glenn. And thanks, all, for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and David and I will welcome any additional questions by telephone. And with that, back you, David.","David Erickson","Thank you for joining us on today's call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce, Mr. David Erickson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Erickson, you may now begin.","David Erickson","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our first quarter 2014 financial results. During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and the accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A.","Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Scott Ullem, CFO.

Mussallem","Thank you, David. We're pleased to report a robust start to 2014 with first quarter results reflecting better-than-expected THV results and solid bottom line performance. This quarter, THV growth in Europe was very strong, even better than expected. This portfolio was driven by strong procedural growth and share gains with SAPIEN XT and the launch of SAPIEN 3, which is off to a great start.","In the U.S., we're still awaiting approval of SAPIEN XT, which is important, as it will provide greater options for U.S. patients who can benefit from the substantial enhancements in this proven platform. And even though we continue to expect competitive headwinds to tamper growth in 2014, we remain confident that our innovative pipeline of products will enable us to lift growth in 2015 and beyond.","Now turning to quarterly specifics. Total underlying sales grew 8% to $529 million. These results exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the THV sales return reserve, which Scott will elaborate on later.","In transcatheter valves, underlying global sales grew 14%, driven by higher-than-planned OUS sales, which accounted for approximately 60% of the total sales. THV sales in the U.S. were roughly in line with our expectations. Overall, pricing was stable.","Outside the U.S., THV sales grew 33% on an underlying basis, driven by exceptionally strong growth in Europe and the ongoing rollout of SAPIEN XT in Japan. The positive procedural growth trends in Europe that we saw in the second half of last year further strengthened so far this year, and we estimate this drove well over half of our OUS growth in the quarter.","In the first quarter in Europe, where all our latest competitive products are available, we feel it was noteworthy that SAPIEN XT continued to gain market share in accounts not yet converted to SAPIEN 3. More recent competitors still are having limited impact in the region.","Our SAPIEN 3 valve is receiving a very favorable response from clinicians. Noted for its lower profile and the ability to address paravalvular leak, SAPIEN 3 represents our best technology to date, and we believe it is helping to stimulate further market growth. With just 2 months of the launch underway, SAPIEN 3 accounted for almost 1\/3 of our OUS sales this quarter.","In Japan, we're pleased with how our launch of SAPIEN XT is progressing. In our second quarter of launch, THV sales in that country were $7 million, and we continue to expect $40 million to $50 million of SAPIEN XT sales this year.","In the U.S., underlying THV commercial and clinical sales were $78 million for the quarter, which also included a negative net stocking amount that reduced this figure by approximately 10%. While there were limited stocking sales this quarter, they were more than offset by our rapid conversion of customers to consignment. Excluding the impact of net stocking in both period, usage grew in the mid-teens year-over-year.","During the quarter, we continued to add new commercial sites and remain on track with our previously stated goal to add 45 to 65 new sites during 2014. Clinical sales were comparable to last quarter.","As evidenced in Europe, where TAVR has been available since 2007, we believe the U.S. opportunity is large and we continue to demonstrate, and will continue to demonstrate strong growth. This confidence is supported by the growing body of impressive clinical evidence, advancements in procedural technique and patient selection, as well as new devices that can expand access to more patients.","Turning to our pipeline. We are confident that we will receive FDA approval of our SAPIEN XT system this quarter, and we're prepared to launch immediately. Receiving these approval is important and it will provide greater options for patients who can benefit from the substantial enhancements of this proven platform.","Enrollment in our U.S. SAPIEN 3 trial of 1,000 intermediate risk patients is on track, to be completed by the end of the year. As a reminder, enrollment in this high-risk and inoperable arm -- enrollment in the high-risk and inoperable patient arm is complete, and we continue to estimate FDA approval for these patients in 2016.","At EuroPCR meeting next month, clinicians will present data on the early experience with SAPIEN 3. We expect these data will demonstrate a notable reduction in PV Leak, an important complication. In the earliest clinical experience, a higher-than-expected pacemaker rate was observed, which has subsequently been addressed by the valve placement technique. In our sizable commercial experience, pacemaker rates have returned to best-in-class levels.","In summary, we're pleased with our transcatheter sales results in Europe, Japan and the U.S. this quarter, and continue to believe global TAVR procedures will grow 15% to 20% annually over the longer term. We will provide updated guidance at our next earnings update, when SAPIEN XT is approved.","Turning to the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Sales were $203 million, up 4% on an underlying basis, driven by healthy unit growth, partially offset by a small ASP decline. The decline was a result of a change in regional selling mix, as pricing within each region remains stable.","In the U.S., surgical valve sales grew 6% this quarter, led by units. We believe the favorable surgical valve market trends continued this quarter with an overall -- with an increase in overall procedures in low-single digits. In addition, we believe many physicians continue to return to the paramount valve family after trying competitor products.","Earlier this month, we were pleased to receive CE Mark for our advanced INTUITY Elite valve system. We've initiated the launch in Europe. At the upcoming April 8, THV in Toronto, 3-year data from the European CE Mark train and trial will be presented. We expect OUS sales of INTUITY Elite to gain momentum as 2014 progresses.","In the U.S., we are continuing to enroll patients in our transform trial for INTUITY Elite and our COMMENCE trial studying GLX, our advanced tissue platform on aortic and Mitral Magna Ease valves. Both remain on track to be completed by the end of the year.","We're also pleased that 25-year follow-up data with our valve and the mitral position has now been published in the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery. This series of data demonstrated best-in-class valve durability in these 450 patients.","Given the solid start to the year and favorable market conditions, we continue to expect underlying sales growth of this product group to be in the 4% to 7% range in 2014, driven by additional traction of INTUITY Elite in Europe.","Turning to the clinical care product group. Total sales for the quarter was $131 million, which grew 5% on an underlying basis. Growth was driven by core hemodynamic products outside the U.S. and enhanced surgical recovery products in the U.S. As a reminder, ESR includes our minimally and noninvasive products, such as FloTrac and ClearSight.","During the quarter, we initiated the European launch of ClearSight, our integrated, noninvasive monitoring technology. We continue to believe ClearSight is an attractive product for hospitals that are looking for a noninvasive technology to monitor a greater number of patients. We continue to expect a U.S. launch of ClearSight in the third quarter of this year.","Given the strong start to the year, we expect to build on our strong leadership position and deliver underlying sales growth of 3% to 6%, aided by the growing adoption of ESR, which includes our new ClearSight product.","During the quarter, we reported that we successfully completed the first 3 human implants of our FORTIS mitral transcatheter heart valve, which were performed in February and March by the heart team at St. Thomas' hospital in London. Clinicians are treating additional patients, and we expect them to report clinical results at future medical meetings, including a late breaker presentation at EuroPCR next month.","Although durable success will not be known without significantly more experience and longer term follow up, we believe mitral valve disease is undertreated worldwide, and there's a particular need among patients, who are too high-risk to benefit from traditional surgical options.","Before we get into financials, I'd like to recap how we view the protection of intellectual property. We expect to compete primarily on the merits of our technology. For over a decade, Edwards has invested more than $1 billion in TAVR technologies. An important element to support the long-term investments needed to bring innovation to patients is the knowledge that our inventions will be honored under the law. This has prompted us to vigorously defend these inventions.","As you know, there's been a lot of recent activity on the foundational THV patents in the U.S. We've received another interim patent, term extension for the Andersen patent to May of 2015 and our request for a permanent extension to March 2016 remains under consideration at the FDA.","As has been well reported, a federal district court, in response to Medtronic's continued willful infringement, ordered a preliminary injunction. The appeals court postponed the effectiveness of this injunction pending further notice. A decision on whether the injunction was properly granted is expected in Q3. Regardless of the outcome, we remain committed to ensuring that patients continue to have access to appropriate transcatheter therapy.","Earlier in the quarter, another federal jury found Medtronic to willfully infringe a second Edwards THV patent and awarded past damages of $394 million to Edwards. This Cribier patent is valid until the end of 2017. Although the enforcement of our IP represents potential financial upside for our company, we have not included any benefit from patent litigation in our guidance.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott B. Ullem","Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. This quarter, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share grew to $0.76. Excluding the change in the treatment of intellectual property litigation, earnings per share would have been $0.04 lower. I'll take a minute to explain the accounting change.","Previously, litigation costs related to protecting Edwards intellectual property were capitalized and amortized over the life of the related IP. Beginning in 2014, to improve comparability, increase visibility and better align with industry peers, we began expensing these costs as incurred. All IP litigation expenses are reflected on a new line in our statement of operations called Intellectual Property Litigation Expense or Income. Amounts in this new line also include IP-related awards, such as the initial payment we received from Medtronic for patent infringement in the first quarter of 2013.","The timing and magnitude of these fees and awards are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from period to period. Therefore, starting this quarter, non-GAAP earnings exclude all IP litigation expenses and awards.","Regarding the full year 2014 impact of this new treatment, our original guidance assumed we would incur about $0.10 per share in litigation expenses that we will now exclude when we report adjusted earnings per share. As a result, our guidance for the year is a range around $3.10 per share under the new accounting. We posted to our website a schedule detailing the financial impact for the past 5 years.","Separately, today, we also posted on our website supplemental information detailing the quarterly impact of the sales return reserve for our transcatheter valve products. We announced last quarter that as Edwards launches SAPIEN 3 in Europe and SAPIEN XT in the U.S., we will exchange previously sold transcatheter valves for these more advanced technologies.","Accounting rules require that we record a reserve against sales of valves that we forecast will be exchanged for next-generation products in the future, and require that we reverse this reserve when we ship the replacement product.","In order to be transparent and to improve comparability of our quarterly transcatheter heart valve sales, we are providing the impact of this reserve, which in this first quarter, reduced our THV sales by a net $6 million, from $195 million to $189 million. In addition, we record a separate reserve for the cost of prior generation THV products that will not be sold. This reserve will not reverse in the future. And since it's a write-off related to the product exchange, we excluded this special expense from non-GAAP profits.","The impact of this write-off reduced our gross profit margin by approximately 200 basis points in the first quarter. And the combined impact of these 2 THV reserves reduce our GAAP EPS by $0.10 in the first quarter. Again, further details are available in a supplemental schedule on our website.","In the quarter, our GAAP gross profit margin was 72.1%, compared to 75.6% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by the approximate 200-basis-point impact from the THV product exchanges, higher manufacturing costs and weaker currencies.","For the full year 2014, we continue to expect our gross profit margin, excluding special items, to be approximately 73%, reflecting headwinds from our currency contracts in the second half of the year. First quarter selling, general and administrative expenses were $197 million, or 37.7% of sales, an increase of 8% over the prior year. This increase was driven primarily by Japan and U.S. transcatheter valve-related expenses and a larger accrual for incentive compensation.","We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 37% and 38% of sales for the full year. We are actively working to leverage our scale so that over time, revenues grow faster than expenses. We continue to aggressively invest in research and development, and spending in the quarter grew 8% to $86 million, or 16.4% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in heart valve clinical studies and transcatheter research and development projects. We expect our R&D investments to remain at approximately 16% of sales for the full year.","During the first quarter, we recorded a $7.5 million expense to settle all past and future obligations related to one of our intellectual property agreements. This special charge decreased diluted GAAP earnings per share by $0.06, and this one-time expense was excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP EPS, which totaled $0.76. Net interest expense for the quarter increased to $3.5 million, primarily as a result of our $600 million issuance of 5-year notes last October. For the full year 2014, we continue to expect net interest expense to be between $12 million and $15 million.","Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 22%. Excluding the impact from special items, our adjusted tax rate was 22.5%. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 20% to 22%, which anticipates renewal of the federal research and development tax credit in the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange rates decreased first quarter sales by $6 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our recent guidance, FX rates had less than $0.01 impact on earnings per share.","Looking forward, with the slight improvement in the yen and euro foreign exchange rates, at current rates, we now expect only a $10 million negative impact to full year sales compared to last year.","Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $125 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $139 million, less capital spending of $14 million. For 2014, excluding special items, we continue to expect free cash flow to be between $325 million and $425 million.","Turning to our 2014 guidance. For sales, we are reiterating our previous guidance for all of our product lines. Driven by our strong performance in transcatheter valves, we continue to expect full year total sales of $2.05 billion to $2.25 billion.","For the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy group, we continue to expect sales of $810 million to $850 million. In transcatheter heart valves, we expect sales of $700 million to $820 million. And in the critical care product group, we continue to expect sales of $535 million to $575 million.","As I mentioned earlier, our guidance for non-GAAP earnings per share is a range around $3.10. The increase over our previous guidance is a result of the assumed impact of the change in treatment of intellectual property litigation. As we've said, previously, we plan to return capital to shareholders by utilizing most of our budgeted 2014 free cash flow to repurchase shares early in 2014. We actually repurchased 4.4 million shares for $300 million in the first quarter, and we expect full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 108 million shares.","For the second quarter 2014, we project total sales to be between $525 million and $565 million, and diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be between $0.71 and $0.81. And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks, Scott. As the transcatheter valve procedures continue to expand and we further strengthen our competitive position with innovative new technologies, we remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity represented by transcatheter valves. Edwards remains dedicated to investing in transformational structural heart disease, therapies and Critical Care technologies for clinicians and their patients around the world. And with that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David Erickson","Thank you, Mike. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Mike, just one clarification. The mid-teens usage year-over-year for TAVI in the United States, was that for you guys or for the market?","Michael A. Mussallem","That was for us, Larry.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, I'm having trouble -- I mean, maybe it's something we can take off-line, if you don't have the numbers handy. But the $78 million for clinical and commercial, how are you getting into the mid-teens usage growth year-over-year?","Michael A. Mussallem","Well, as I think we mentioned, Larry, the clinical sales were comparable to last quarter. I think last quarter, they were around $13 million. And the net stocking was a decrease to that of approximately 10%. So if you put those together, I guess, you'd back into commercial sales that were pretty close to the same numbers as the reported sales, right? Commercial sales being in that $77 million, $78 million range.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I got it. And so the net stocking is not the $7 million U.S. reversal, that's separate reduction?","Michael A. Mussallem","Exactly, Larry. That's completely separate. The net stocking was about a 10% decrease that was separate from the reversal.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I got it. And then just for my second question then. On SAPIEN XT, do you still feel good about getting both high-risk in inoperable, as well as the 29-millimeter valve when XT is first approved?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I think we've been vocal about that in the past. We have requested the 29 millimeter and the high risk indication. But obviously, it's subject to the FDA's decision.","Operator","The next question is from Rick Wise of Stifel.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","A couple of things. When you look at Europe and the rollout of SAPIEN 3, I think I heard you say that roughly 1\/3 of your sales was SAPIEN 3. How do we think about the mix in Europe going forward? Do you expect 100% conversion to SAPIEN 3? And maybe, how long does that take?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I think, as I noted, we're about 2 months into the SAPIEN 3 launch, and what we said is about 1\/3 of our OUS sales was SAPIEN 3. So that will be actually a little higher than that in Europe. And that's -- we think that's going to go pretty fast. It'll -- might take all year for it to happen, but we largely think that when people have an option to go to SAPIEN 3, they will go there. And so that will happen. But we're just at the early stage of that. Does that answer your question?","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, yes. And Mike, you -- I think logic would have suggested that, that XT would get approval sort of midyear, you said that. But you're sounding so much more concretely confident in a second quarter approval. Is it -- can you share with us why that confidence and why you're saying it so strongly now?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, we would have hoped that we would have had it approved by now, Rick. But we are confident that we're going to receive it this quarter. I don't have anything specific to add about the process. But as you can imagine, we're pretty far along in that process at this time.","Operator","The next question is from Bruce Nudell of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, one of the things that we picked up clinically from clinical sources at ACC was speculation that given the strength of TAVI, the results as a class, that it is conceivable to have PARTNER IIa conceivably looked at on a 1-year follow up as opposed to 2 years. Is that even remotely possible?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I think I've commented on this in the past. We really -- we don't know is the short answer. We have a 2-year endpoint on that, and I will still continue for the purpose of how you do your estimations to continue to anticipate that. Obviously, if we think there's some opportunity, we'd consider that as an alternative. But I don't have anything that can provide clarification at this point, Bruce.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Fair enough. And there was a lot of back-and-forth legally. And my read of what the original judge said was that he was not -- he was considering the uses of the -- with regard to the extension, he was viewing it pretty broadly. Could you comment on that aspect of this argument as to whether or not the patent Andersen applies broadly to the general use of SAPIEN, irrespective of transdermal, irrespective of size, et cetera?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, there are a couple of things. Judge Sleet, the federal judge at the district level, he has already ruled that he believes that this is worthy of an injunction. So he's already ruled on that. That is being appealed. Separate from that, there's this process that goes on that says how long will that extension go on. And what I reported now was that we're extended until May of '15, and we have petition to go through March of '16. So does that answer your question?","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","No, I guess the counter argument was that it should be parsed just to the FDA approved indication at that instant when the patent expired. Any comment on that?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, we don't think Medtronic's arguments have much merit in that regard. And we think that Judge Sleet has already agreed with our position. This is not something that is being litigated.","Operator","The next question is from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to maybe start with a follow up just on the underlying growth in the U.S. market. I know you talked about mid-teens, and obviously, there was an estimate out there for whatever Medtronic is going to do. But I guess -- I'm wondering, can you give some perspective on where we are in kind of tapping out market potential with the current size valve on the market, meaning SAPIEN? And any sense as to how much additional potential there is from having smaller valves in the market and maybe how many patients are getting turned away for procedures now or there's insufficient tracks [ph]? Can you help us understand the potential reacceleration that could come from having 18 French devices on the market?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, yes, thanks very much, David. Broadly, even if it was just SAPIEN in the market, we think that the market would do some growing. But we think that there is some significant uptick will come from having valves that will treat patients with larger annulus. So for example, of our 29-millimeter valve were available, like what happened in Europe, we thought there was substantial uptick in market growth with that 29-millimeter valve. Separate from that is just the access issue. One of the challenges associated with the SAPIEN platform, which is our earliest generation, that's the only country that we still sell it in is this large profile. And we think when we get down to an 18 French profile, like in SAPIEN XT, that will also be an accelerator of the market. So we think that's maybe, let alone, when you get do something like SAPIEN 3.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then, I guess, there is a follow-up of that. If I throw out a number that some of the survey data that we've collected would show that 20% to 30% of patients showing up for procedures are getting turned away because of insufficient, faster access. How would you respond to a number like that?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, one of the things that we see and maybe one of ways to look at it, David, it's hard for anyone to be absolutely quantitative on this, is we're seeing over 50%. Sometimes it's close to 60% of procedures being done transapically, right now with the SAPIEN system. Once we are in Europe, well penetrated with XT that move to more of a 70-30 split. And we're watching that move again with SAPIEN 3 to some kind of higher numbers, probably in excess of 80-20, maybe even 85-15. So it gives us some kind of signal about what happens when you get these smaller delivery profiles.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. Just one quick gross margin question for Scott. I know there are a lot of moving parts here with the FX hedging lags, the contracts in the back half of the year and then manufacturing inefficiencies. Is there anyway you can help us think about what is like the underlying product gross margin of the business in the context of that 72% number you expect to report?","Scott B. Ullem","It's a good question. It's something that we've really tried to shy away from in terms of reporting product line gross profitability. And so we've been intentionally vague about it. But I'll try to give you a little bit of roadmap to at least see through the impact of this sales swap reserve. But beyond that, we just can't get any the details about what's the profitability of different SAPIEN products and surgical valves and so on.","Operator","The next question is from Raj Denhoy of Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Wondered if I could ask about the U.S. market. I don't think you gave the number of centers in the quarter, maybe if you could provide that?","Michael A. Mussallem","We've been, Raj -- I mean, thanks for the question. We're trying to get off specific center accounts. One of the things that we did say, though, is that we're on track to meet our previously stated goal of 45 to 65 new centers in the year. So we had a nice uptick in centers in the quarter that was very consistent with being able to stay within that target.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And maybe I could just ask about Europe, you gave some very positive commentary about both procedures being strong, but then also some share gains. I'm curious, if you could maybe offer some thoughts around what's happening in Europe, particularly on the procedure side? Are you seeing further expansion of transcatheter valves into surgical procedures? Is it more geographic expansion? Some detail will be helpful.","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure. I think, I noted that the growth in Europe, it seemed like it had picked up in the second half of last year. And we think Q1 was even stronger than that, stronger than we had expected. That growth rate must have moved into the mid-teens at this point. Growth seem to be spread across the continent. So many countries, pretty much all the countries, were engaged, including the south of Europe. And I -- we attribute it to a combination of sort of just the growing body of impressive clinical evidence. But also, in particular, because of S -- SAPIEN 3 is lower profile and the PV Leak solution, we think that may start to stimulate some clinicians to move a little faster than they might have in the past, although it's a little early to say that decisively.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And I know, it's again a difficult question, but you don't have a sense of where some of the more established markets, like Germany, maybe in terms of penetration at this point?","Michael A. Mussallem","No. I mean, Germany, as I think, well noted that the treatment rate in Germany is much higher than many of the other countries in Europe. But here it is, continuing to grow in double digits. So I don't know how you characterize how far along that is. It's still going.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Mills of Canaccord.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","If you don't mind, stay with Europe for a second. I'm just -- if we assume that you mentioned that second half of last year is when we start to see perhaps a bit of an acceleration to the European market. We'll anniversary that sort of towards the back end of the year. So I'm just wondering, if you can give us a sense for, over these last 3 quarters, how same -- sort of for a lack of a better term, same-store sales procedure growth has gone? And are some of our researchers suggest you are doing really well in markets that maybe you weren't in 12 to 15 months ago, in other regions in Europe and Eastern Europe, et cetera? And also, I guess, my second question stay outside of the U.S, lot of focus on the U.S., outside of U.S., in Japan. Just trying to -- I guess, on a qualitative and a quantitative basis, how is the development that market going relative to what you thought it would be at this point?","Michael A. Mussallem","Okay. Thanks, Jason. So I want to make sure that I answer your question correctly in Europe. So let me take a shot at it, and you tell me whether I've gotten there. As I noted, it was pretty broad-based in Europe. And even though we have had pretty consistent growth in a big place like Germany, the fact that countries, like France, really picked up. And that's one that has very little SAPIEN 3 at this point or within the fact that we saw Southern Europe pickup as well. That's noteworthy, and the U.K. for that matter. So you -- the picture to have the kind of growth that we experienced in Europe, it needs to be pretty broad-based, and we did see that. So it's not just in the usual suspects. It's a little broader than that. Did that -- we're still early in the launch of SAPIEN 3, with only 2 months of sales. But again, that one is going to drive more growth further on in the year. Comparisons will get tougher later on in the year so that may affect growth rate, Jason, as you correctly noted, but at the same time, we'll see if this, the SAPIEN 3 effect, has some impact on lifting the market. In Japan, it's pretty much going just the way that we thought it would go. The fact that we have $7 million worth of sales in the first quarter is very consistent with the way we think that ramp will look in ramping toward $45 million to $55 million. The addition of accounts, which we suggested would be around 4 accounts per month, is going very consistently. I don't know, I may have misstated what our growth rate was in Japan, it was $40 million to $50 million, I think, is what we projected. So does that answer your questions?","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Yes. Just going back to the first one, I guess, what I'm asking is just what -- if you could sort of break out what growth, what sorts of growth rates you are seeing from increased utilization, procedure growth, that sort of same-store sales? And then, what sort of incremental revenue you're getting from adding new centers that weren't sort of in the system this time last year?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Well, a few things. One is, we are getting -- most of the growth is coming from existing centers, there's no doubt about that. We're -- there are some new centers, I think, particularly in France, but most of it is coming from existing centers. I think, as we noted, that where -- even before we've launched S3 in the accounts, where XT is available and not SAPIEN 3, we're watching XT gain some market share. So we've also experienced that. And I guess, that probably gets at the key part of the question, Jason.","Operator","The next question is from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I was just hoping to get some color on U.S. market dynamics in the quarter. Obviously, this was your first quarter with a competitive valve on the market. And I was just wondering if you could provide any color about total market growth, so we could potentially back in the market shares here or give us sort of anything on that front to go on.","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks, Danielle. What I would say so far, it's probably gone pretty much the way we expect it. We don't give specific share assumptions, but we have that first mover advantage, and we think there's a lot of clinical preference that goes along with that. It's going to be important for us to get XT. Once that's approved, we think that's going to be important. The fact that we don't have XT right now means that we feel particularly some impact on these larger sizes. But short of that, I don't know that there's much else that is out of what you would expect.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And just if I could follow up on that, Mike, any sense of how many, and I guess, David, or someone might have touched on this earlier, how many of those larger sizes are out there and may have gotten treated in the quarter? I guess what I'm asking is, how much could market growth actually have increased because of treating a backlog of larger size patients? Or maybe not increased and the market shifted to larger sizes to work through the backlog and we could see some stabilization going forward once the larger-sized valves are worked through. Any perspective there?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. No, not really. It's really hard to say. It's a smaller percentage of patients. And again, if those were going to competitive products, we would probably have a little less insight on it as well.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And one more question. Just looking at EU, EU market growth has accelerated really nicely here. Seems like it's actually sustainable. As you see new valves hit -- next-generation valves hit the U.S. market, so XT and then eventually, hopefully, SAPIEN 3 and some competitive valves as well, do you think that, that level of growth acceleration is at all representative of what we could see the U.S.? Or is U.S. going to be just totally capped by CMS and FDA? I would love some perspective there for -- to indicate any longer-term growth here.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. So I think the fact that there are more competitors, that may have some lift. But the biggest thing about new devices, is the fact that both you have the slower -- the lower profile on the way, and I think that's very attractive, and when you have a larger annular sizes that could be treated. Those things are meaningful in terms of lifting the market. When you combine it with the fact that the evidence is just continuing to build, every time we hear presentations for the most part, it's demonstrating that it's better and better, we know that patients prefer this option. And so we think that will drive growth. And I think, we've been pretty vocal in terms of what we think that growth can do long-term. When I reflect back, it's some of these clinical trials that we've been involved in. So when people get randomized for surgery, we even find 10% of those patients off and will opt out of the trial rather than have surgery. It tells you a little bit about the mindset of these patients and their preference for catheter-based options.","Operator","The next question is from Brooks West of Piper Jaffray.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Mike, just a couple of quick ones from me. Can you remind us, what are the sizes of SAPIEN 3 that are available in Europe right now?","Michael A. Mussallem","So in Europe, the 23-millimeter, 26-millimeter and 29-millimeter is available. The 20-millimeter is still in a study. That's enrolled slowly. And we expect that, I think, sometime in 2015.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then on -- just circling back to your comments on data that might be at EuroPCR. Any more detail on maybe the size of the data sets we might see on SAPIEN 3? Or any other detail on some of the clinical experience that might be shared? And then, did you mentioned, are we going to see anything more on percutaneous mitral from you guys at PCR?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. So a couple of things. One, in terms of SAPIEN 3, I think we'll see some of the CE Mark data on SAPIEN 3. Additionally, and I'm not sure about this, we may see some data from John Webb on his experience or some of the Canadian experience on SAPIEN 3. But I think it's not going to be a huge data set at this point. But it'll give a -- it'll be a good indicator. We -- there is a late breaker presentation that's planned at EuroPCR for our FORTIS mitral valve. So that will, obviously, be a small experience at this point, but there is a plan for a presentation.","Operator","The next question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mike, can you just -- you sounded very positive, obviously, on XT and 29-millimeter. And I wonder, if you think about the ongoing legal process, how important are XT and 29-millimeter? Obviously, your ongoing negotiation with Medtronic here coming up in May, as well as the federal process? And maybe you could just help us understand, if you were to see successful in getting 29-millimeter in XT, what percent of the market of that point do you think that you treat?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. A couple of things. You know one is as it relates to the legal rulings and so forth, I think there's no doubt there's been an infringement. You've seen now jury trials, they've talked about willful infringement. That's independent of sizes. That's just taking a look at what the history is. When it comes time to actually imply an injunction, one of the things that the judge has chosen to look at is sort of trading of patent protection versus some of the safety issues, and when we don't have SAPIEN XT available, we aren't able to treat as broad a range of patients. So XT becomes more meaningful in that discussion, when you talk about limiting it. So does that end up answering the question, David?","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I might -- just specifically do you have a sense of -- if you get 29 in XT, what percent of the patients you think you treat here in the U.S.? And is that number 95%, 90%?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, a vast majority. Greater than 90%, maybe 95%. We think it's going to be a big number.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just on your mitral timing, Mike, there is another company with a first-generation mitral valve for the first human implant, can you just talk to us where you are in that program? And where we can start thinking about a CE Mark trial? Or whether you're comfortable that you sort locked the design you can move into a larger trial versus a single slide or single patient experiences?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. We're still early in this is the short answer. And you just -- it's hard to have a good feel for durable success without significantly more experience and more longer term follow-up than we have or any of the competitors at this point. So this is one that I think is going to bear watching closely, David. It's too early at this stage of the game to fully judge the value or competitiveness of any program, ours included.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So if I push you to 2015 CE Mark initiation of the trial, that's still not comfortable with that number?","Michael A. Mussallem","No, we're not. No, we think that's pretty mature to be thinking about that, David. We'll let you know if we -- if the data supports moving forward to a CE Mark.","Operator","The next question is from Glenn Novarro of RBC.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Regarding the litigation with Medtronic, Mike, you sent out a letter to doctors, and you sent it to The Street as well. And in the letter, you talked about how you've actually tried to reach out to Medtronic, and there seems to be some sort of compromise that you're willing to maybe accept. Can you maybe go through a little bit of what this compromise -- or what this olive branch was, and kind of what's next in their process?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I think we have been pretty vocal to hear that we have tried to provide some room. And we've been consistent about that, about the fact that we have not asked that there be some out right ban of core valve. When we get into these kinds of discussions, they're confidential. However, we expect that they're going to continue with respect in particular to what the district court has asked us to do, which is to work something out in conjunction with this preliminary injunction. So I'm not able to provide any more color other than that, Glenn, but hopefully it gives you a sense that we would like to reach resolution, as the judge indicated.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Was the compromise something to do with, okay, Medtronic is in 50, 60 sites in the U.S. already trained, was it to let them stay in those sites, but then no further expansion?","Michael A. Mussallem","Glenn, as you might imagine, this all happened over a matter of days. And so I think we went back and forth, and there was -- it looked like some sincere movement by both companies. But the judge really limited the number of sites. He's the one that said that, and so we are operating under his instruction.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just one quick follow-up. In Europe, when you launched SAPIEN 3, was there any stocking that was in Europe on SAPIEN 3?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, there was a little bit of stocking in SAPIEN 3, but it was very small. And I mean, very small, I don't want to say that it was probably not even -- it was just small. Maybe not even 1 million or so.","Operator","The next question is from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess just following on that, was there any stocking sales for SAPIEN XT in Japan included in that figure this quarter?","Michael A. Mussallem","No, Japan is a consignment market only.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on -- I just want to make sure I understand all the different GAAP to non-GAAP numbers. You guys are not providing any sort of sense of what the non-GAAP gross margin figure is this quarter?","Scott B. Ullem","No, we actually are. The guidance we provided, the 73% gross margin, is a non-GAAP number.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's your guidance. But did you give any for the second quarter just adjusting for all these reserves? Or is it safe to assume that the -- what you backed out as a one -- or where we have to add back in, I guess, as we back in the sales to get your pro forma number? Or then add back, I guess, whatever the profit would be to get to the 76%. I'm just having a time bridging to get back to that 76% non-GAAP number.","Scott B. Ullem","In the 76%, Kristen, tell me again how you're trying to get there? You're going to walk from GAAP, right?","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. So from the walk from GAAP you guys are adding back the reserve to the sales line item to get to your underlying results.","Scott B. Ullem","Right.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Presumably then you have a non-GAAP gross margin. Did you give the non-GAAP gross margin in your prepared remarks? You only talked to the GAAP gross margin for the first quarter?","Scott B. Ullem","Yes, we did. The non-GAAP gross -- the GAAP gross margin was 72.1%. And we said, roughly a couple of 100 basis points of that gross margin decline versus last year represents the impact of that sales return reserve. So call it, 74-plus percent gross margin, if you strip out the impact of the sales returns reserve.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Perfect, okay. And then just looking ahead, should we assume that they are error embedded within your guidance for the second quarter? Any sort of reserve adjustments, either as you, I guess, presumably get SAPIEN XT, would be then reducing that out? Or how should we just think about your guidance relative to what you're expecting on the reserve front?","Scott B. Ullem","Yes, again, all the guidance is exclusive of the reserve. The guidance completely disregards the accounting reserve activity. So the 73% gross margin that we guided to is exclusive of any reserve activity, in or out.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And your sales guidance for the second quarter, does that have any adjustment?","Scott B. Ullem","Yes, same thing. That's a non-GAAP -- that's non-GAAP sales guidance. So the GAAP number will show the ins and outs to that sales return reserve. But really, in terms of just modeling the year and the quarters, all the numbers that we've given you are non-GAAP.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just on the data front, at EuroPCR, will we see any longer term follow-up on the SAPIEN XT system? Because 2 years, I would have thought it would have been a ACC, but I'm just wondering if we will see that at EuroPCR?","Michael A. Mussallem","I do not expect to see the SAPIEN XT at EuroPCR. We would expect that there probably be some 2-year data sometime later on this year at a medical meeting, but not at EuroPCR.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Pasquale - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Chris Pasquale in here for Mike. I just want circle back on the question about the a U.S. TAVI in at this quarter, real quickly. Am I hearing you correctly, so $78 million was your reported number? And if you back out the next stocking impacts, your sales would have been more like $86 million to $87 million, is that right?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes.","Christopher T. Pasquale - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So that's up solidly year-over-year, but it compares to more like $88 million to $91 million over the last 3 quarters. Now obviously Medtronic had more of an impact this quarter, but as we step into 2Q here, the comps get more challenging. So how much confidence do you have that the market itself is not starting to fly total [ph] but just recently in a few quarters in a row on that same range?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. I don't know. It's our sense that the market is going to be stimulated by the addition of valves that are allowed to -- that can treat some larger patient annulus and also the attraction associated with smaller profiles, Chris, so we don't think it's going to be a negative trend in the market. We think it'll be the opposite.","Christopher T. Pasquale - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then on the European side of the business. I'm trying to understand some of the dynamics there and that the nice pickup in growth that you saw. How much of that would you attribute really to share gains with SAPIEN 3 and kind of 1 bucket versus a pickup in underlying market growth? And for that second bucket, to the extent that it was a contributor, what do think is driving that in the market that's more mature at this point?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. I think what we've reported was not just Europe alone, but OUS. And what we said is that over half of that growth was by -- it is just a pickup in overall procedures across the geographies, and so that's not share gain. In terms of the combination of SAPIEN 3 and XT did gain share. And I -- what I tried to note in my earlier comments that we have places where SAPIEN 3 -- it's only been -- it's early in the introduction. So it's accounted for less than 1\/3 of the OUS sales. In the -- so in addition to whatever SAPIEN 3 share might have come, which there was some, the XT was actually gaining share within the accounts where it was still isolated as the only valve available.","Christopher T. Pasquale - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So absent Japan, which obviously saw a big pickup because you weren't really there 1 year ago, in the European market, is there anything that you would attribute that pickup in underlying utilization to for the market that's had the technology available now for close to 7 years?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. It's a good question, Chris. We feel like we noted this impact had started earlier. So the second half of last year, we felt like it picked up, and Europe was going nicely, maybe some of that was the recovery in the South, but we're also are seeing it broadly across all of Europe. It really ticked up in the first quarter. And possibly that was stimulated by SAPIEN 3's entree into the market. It may have stimulated some interest. But it's still early, Chris, and it's hard to know what's driving that.","Operator","And our final question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of really quick ones here to cap off. So on the legal side, is it safe to assume that this, in your view, that this stay will last until the appeal is over?","Michael A. Mussallem","It's a really good question, Bob. Unfortunately, the appellate court didn't give us a lot of definition. They said pending further notice. And so what that means is that this is really a fluid situation that's evolving each week. It's possible that the appellate court could act before the scheduled June hearing, but we would be guessing. And we'd also anticipate that we'd be back in front of Judge Sleet on May 21. But again, a very fluid situation that's difficult to predict.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So on your comment about Q3, I mean, you're sort of putting that out there as maybe worst case or could this also extend much further into the year?","Michael A. Mussallem","Oh, well, in particular, I think the appellate court seem to indicate that they would hear this in Q3. There's a June 19 briefing that has been established and the hearing would be later. And so we're expecting that would be Q3. But again, that's kind of our best estimate, Bob.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then lastly, really quickly on the -- your request for an extension on Andersen out into March of 2016. When will we know something about that? And then also, is there a next milestone we should be thinking about relative to Cribier or any of your other patents?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, the short answer, Bob, is we don't know when we're going to have that decision. The patent office talks to FDA about it, and then we hear back. And we don't know when they're going to act on that. The Cribier patent goes to 2017, if that was a question, right?","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was just curious whenever there is some -- a new milestone in terms of the litigation around Cribier, not in terms of the Life?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. I don't know. The -- in the past, the appellate court has taken some time before that's taken place. So I have not heard of specific date, Bob. But when we have something, I'll update you on the future call. Okay, well, thanks, everybody, for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and David and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. With that, back to you, David.","David Erickson","Thank you for joining us on today's call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Erickson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Erickson, you may begin.","David Erickson","Welcome and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our first quarter 2013 financial results. During","Today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Abate, CFO.","Before I turn the call over to Mike, I'd like to remind you that during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, our expectations regarding sales and sales growth, gross profit margin, earnings per share, SG&A, R&D, taxes, free cash flow, diluted shares outstanding and foreign currency impacts. These statements also include our current expectations for the timing, status and expected outcomes of our clinical trials, regulatory submissions and approvals and reimbursement conditions, as well as expectations regarding market opportunities, the U.S. launch of SAPIEN, other new product introductions, patent matters and our pipeline. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Although we believe them to be reasonable, these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or experiences to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and excluding special items, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release.","And now I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem","Thank you, David. Our global THV sales growth of 40% was driven by the continued adoption in the U.S. Our clinical results continue to be very positive and we're making good progress on our pipeline of products designed to strengthen our leadership position. Yet global sales this quarter across all product lines were below our expectations, so we're lowering our 2013 guidance primarily to reflect the slower start to the year and an updated foreign exchange impact.","Now turning to the quarterly results. Reported sales grew 8% to $497 million. Sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was 10%. The favorable health care utilization trends we saw in Q4 did not continue in Q1. Additionally, selling days were lower this quarter and were most pronounced in Japan where we experienced the 4-day difference. In Japan -- I mean, excuse me, in Europe, sales grew 4% despite a weakened economic climate. In the U.S., total sales grew 22%.","In transcatheter heart valves, first quarter sales of $170 million were driven by the ongoing U.S. launch of SAPIEN. In the U.S., THV sales were $83 million for the quarter, which included clinical sales of $7 million and net stocking sales of $6 million. Stocking orders were less than expected as we trained fewer TA sites than anticipated. While we estimated procedures nearly tripled from a year ago and were 20% high year than the fourth quarter, they were below our expectations. Today, more than 225 sites in the U.S. offer SAPIEN to their patients. Of these sites, 180 have been trained on a transapical approach. While interest among heart teams for this important delivery option remains high, approximately 20 sites have postponed their TA training. We believe the backlog of TA patients who are awaiting therapy has now been addressed. Overall capacity is still increasing, while some sites report that they currently have capacity constraints. Importantly, clinicians have continued to maintain very high procedural success rates overall even while adopting the new TA approach. As a reminder, we'll continue to report procedural growth in the impact of net stocking in 2013. And in 2014, we expect reported sales to begin tracking procedures performed.","Overall, we believe the reimbursement for TAVR is designed to be fair on a national basis yet regional payments are highly variable. There are some hospitals that question the profitability of this procedure based on their regional reimbursement, as well as how they account for other related services and the allocation of overhead. We continue to engage with these centers to share best practices with a focus on reducing length of stay, as well as lowering procedure-related costs and complications.","Outside the U.S., THV sales grew 8% in the quarter or 7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Our units grew approximately 10% with pricing decline to slightly year-over-year similar to last quarter. Growth was strongest again in Germany, while ongoing austerity measures resulted in negative growth in Southern Europe. Our transfemoral units outside the U.S. grew significantly while non-transfemoral units declined again this quarter driven by a TF-first approach and the impact of competitive transapical products. Last month at the ACC meeting, there were a number of presentations and live cases featuring our SAPIEN technology, including to 2 important late-breaking datasets.","First, the results of our cohort A of the partner trial continue to demonstrate comparable outcomes between the treatment with Edward SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve and open heart surgery for patients at 3 years. These data indicated mortality and stroke rates were similar in 3 years, further strengthening the evidence supporting the use of TAVR in high-risk patients. And second, preliminary results from Cohort B, a PARTNER II trial, demonstrated similar 1-year outcomes and mortality at major clinical events between SAPIEN and XP yet fewer vascular events with a lower profile XT valve. While not directly comparable, we were most pleased to see improved outcomes in both SAPIEN and SAPIEN XP patients as compared with earlier trials.","Now looking at our transcatheter product pipeline. We're still enrolling patients in Cohort A, the surgical arm of our U.S. Partner II clinical study, which is evaluating our SAPIEN XT technology. We continue to expect to complete enrollment around midyear. Additionally, we anticipate submitting our PMA for Cohort B of the PARTNER II trial next week, which we anticipate leads to U.S. approval of SAPIEN XT next year. We continue to enroll patient for the CE Mark trial of our advanced SAPIEN III valve, which is delivered through a 14-French eSheath and designed to reduce paravalvular leak. This keeps us on track to receive a CE Mark and launch this product in Europe by year end.","In Europe, we're continuing to enroll at our self-expanding CENTERA valve trial and clinical experience with this novel valve will be discussed at the EuroPCR next month. Also at PCR, we anticipate a number of important presentations, including early data from our PROTAVI study, which is evaluating the process of stroke and our Embrella device, as well as updates from the source XP registry. In Japan, we continue to expect to receive both regulatory approval and reimbursement for SAPIEN XT by year end, which positions us to have the first commercially available transcatheter valve in that country.","Recently the first implantations of the new delivery system for our Helio aortic insufficiency technology were performed. This new system uses a completely transfemoral approach, making it an interventional procedure. As you may recall, earlier feasibility work with Helio required both transfemoral and transapical access. We're continuing our feasibility work with this system and expect additional clinical experience to be discussed at EuroPCR.","","With respect to our THV patent litigation with CoreValve, we collected $84 million for Medtronic in the quarter, which reflected damages for willful infringement and interest through early 2010. Later this year, we expect the Delaware District Court to address the amount of damages due to Edwards from 2010 forward, as well as our request for an injunction.","The patent office granted our request for a second interim expansion of the Anderson patent, which now extends its life to May of 2014. We expect the final decision on the patent extension to be issued during the first half of next year. And in Germany, the trial for the first of 3 new THV patent infringement cases against Medtronic Core Valve is scheduled for later this month.","In summary, U.S. THV sales are below our expectations, which we believe is primarily the result of evolving economics for some hospitals and still developing capacity of both hospitals and their heart teams. As a result, we're lowering our 2013 guidance primarily to reflect our first quarter experience. We now expect global 2013 transcatheter heart valve sales to grow 25% to 30% on an underlying basis. This would result in sales of $670 million to $750 million, which includes $350 million to $400 million of sales in the U.S.","In light of the reduced guidance, I'd like to remind you how we view the U.S. transcatheter valve opportunity. We are rapidly learning about the factors that influence adoption or continuing and we're continuing to work closely with sites. The untreated aortic stenosis population remains large and we believe a less invasive catheter-based approach remains attractive to patients and clinicians. This is especially true in light of the growing body of clinical evidence and the increasing demand in Europe even 6 years after introduction. For these reasons, our estimate of the size of the U.S. transcatheter valve opportunity for the longer-term remains unchanged.","Now turning to the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Reported sales declined 3% over last year to $198 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales were essentially unchanged compared to the prior year. This quarter's growth rate reflects a tougher comparison and was further tempered by the earlier impact from a competitor's introduction in Japan. Globally, our pricing remains stable. Late in the quarter, we received approval to sell our Magna Ease platform in China, which complements the approval of our paramount valve received late last year. This quarter, INTUITY is starting to impact our sales growth rate. We continue to make progress on our key milestones with this minimally invasive valve system. In Europe, our trials to assess the economics and benefits of INTUITY are progressing as planned and we continue to expect a CE Mark on INTUITY Elite in the third quarter. Elite is our next-generation platform with a lower profile designed to further enable small incisions. In the U.S., we recently received approval from the FDA to include INTUITY Elite in our ongoing transform IDE trial and enrollment is on track.","We continue to enroll patients at our commenced U.S. IDE trial. This trial is studying the GLX tissue on our Magna Ease platform, which now includes both our market-leading aortic and mitral valves. We now expect underlying sales growth in the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group to be between 2% and 5% in 2013 aided by the commercialization of INTUITY but tempered by the slower than expected start to the year.","Turning to the Critical Care product group. Total sales of $129 million for the quarter declined 4% over last year or remained flat excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Growth in advanced monitoring products in Europe and the U.S. was offset by a reduction of distributor inventory in China and an expectant sales decline related to the ongoing exit of our ACCESS product line. The integration of BMEYE is going well and the incorporation of our noninvasive monitoring technology into our EV1000 platform is still on track. While this technology have long-term potential, sales were negligible in the first quarter and will remain moderate until 2014 when we plan to introduce the integrated platform. We remain enthusiastic about the significant opportunity represented by our GlucoClear system and expect 2013 to be a pivotal year as we complete additional studies in Europe and attain greater clarity on the pathway toward U.S. approval. We're on track to meet our key milestones and are encouraged by the early experience. Based on the lower sales this quarter primarily resulting from our decision to reduce distributor inventories in China, we now expect full year 2013 underlying sales growth of 2% to 4% in the Critical Care product group driven by continued growth in our advanced monitoring products.","And now I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Abate","Thank you, Mike. This quarter on a GAAP basis, we achieved diluted EPS of $1.24, which benefited from the Medtronic payment and the 2012 R&D tax credit. Excluding these special items, our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.72 or 36% growth over last year. Also during the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our stock. As Mike mentioned, we have reduced our 2013 projected sales resulting in full year estimated diluted EPS excluding special items of between $3 and $3.10. For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 75.4% compared to 72.3% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven by a more profitable product mix as THV sales continue to grow and a favorable impact from FX. For full year 2013, excluding special items, our guidance remains between 74% and 76%.","First quarter SG&A expenses were $185 million or 37.3% of sales, an increase of 4.5% over the prior year. This increase is driven primarily by the U.S. medical device tax and U.S. transcatheter expenses. Given our revised sales projections, we now expect SG&A as a percentage of sales for the full year to be similar to the current rate. We continue to aggressively invest in R&D and spending in the quarter grew 16% to $80 million or 16% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of additional investments in a number of active heart valve clinical studies. We expect R&D investments to remain at this current ratio of sales for the remainder of the year. As previously announced, in the first quarter we received $84 million from Medtronic related to the damages award for infringement of the U.S. Andersen THV patent. Also, as required by GAAP, this quarter we recorded $8.4 million benefit from the 2012 Federal R&D Tax Credit. For comparison purposes in our non-GAAP results, we already reflected the benefit of the credit in the fourth quarter 2012 and, therefore, excluded it from this quarter. These 2 Special Items increased diluted EPS this quarter by $0.52. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%. Excluding the impact from our 2 special items, our tax rate was 22.4%. We now expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be at the low end of our previous 23% to 24% range.","FX rates negatively impacted first quarter sales by $8 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our recent guidance, FX rates negatively impacted EPS by $0.02. Looking forward with the changes in the yen FX rates, we now expect a $50 million negative impact of full year sales compared to last year, which compares to the $15 million negative impact we provided at our investor conference in December. Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $64 million. We defined this as cash flow from operating activities of $87 million less capital spending of $23 million. Excluding the impact of the payment from Medtronic, our free cash flow was $7 million. For 2013, excluding special items, we now expect free cash flow to be between $270 million and $310 million. During the quarter, we spent approximately $108 million on share repurchases. For modeling purposes, we now project fully diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 116 million in 2013, which is 2 million shares lower than our December guidance. At the end of the quarter, approximately 140 million was available under our existing share repurchase authorization.","Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $558 million. Total debt was $193 million. Our DSO at the end of the quarter was 56 days, a 2-day reduction from the prior quarter. Inventory turns were 1.7, a small decrease from the prior quarter.","Turning to our sales guidance for 2013. Given the lower utilization we experienced in Q1, we now expect full year total sales of $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion, which represents an approximate 10% underlying growth rate. This includes a $35 million larger penalty from foreign exchange compared to the guidance provided in December. For Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group, we now expect sales of $770 million to $810 million. In transcatheter heart valve, we now expect sales of $670 million to $750 million. And in the Critical Care product group, we now expect the sales of $530 million to $570 million. Excluding Special Items, we now expect full year 2013 diluted EPS of $3 to $3.10 for a growth rate of approximately 13%. For the second quarter, we project total sales of $500 million to $530 million and second quarter diluted EPS excluding special items to be between $0.75 and $0.79.","And with that, I'll hand it back over to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks, Tom. We remain committed to our high level of investment and our pipeline of new products for the clinicians we serve and the patients they treat. We believe this enables us to aggressively develop our innovative product lines, driving long-term growth and extending our focused leadership position in structural heart therapies and Critical Care technologies.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to David.","David Erickson","Thank you, Mike. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Mike, you intentionally, in the press release, mentioned that your U.S. market opportunity expectations hadn't changed. Obviously recognizing that similar to the debate out here on the Street, could you give us a bit more granularity as it relates to how you're sizing it? Maybe a bit more color as it relates to the current target population as you see it relative to the current technology and how that target population expands or does whatever you expect it to do as new technology comes through the FDA. And I have one follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure, Jason. I'll speak to the U.S. market because that's really where we changed the estimate for the year and be would imagine that it would cause people to wonder if we thought the opportunity was smaller. And although we thought here in the near term, here, that there may be some capacity constraints and there may be some economic conditions for some sites that might be limiting in the near term, our expectation about the treatment opportunity hasn't changed at all. We continue to be bullish. Our models are driven by the prevalence. We believe that prevalence of this disease has not changed in any way. There's 260,000 patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis that are out there and only a quarter of those patients are treated. And we believe that as this technology continues to prove itself, and we're delighted with how it's demonstrated its impact on a long-term basis, that it's going to encourage these patients that are untreated for a variety of reasons to come off it and to gain treatment, particularly since you have this attractive catheter-based option. We think there's a component of that, which is simply accounts that are still on a learning curve that are coming up, Jason. There's accounts that are developing their referral networks, still training, general cardiologists, clinicians and their patients. So there's a fair amount of that, that's still going on right now. And we think as the technology improves and as the clinicians improve their technique, that this only grows.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I'd like to follow-up on that. Then my second question I'll just ask and get back in queue. The follow-up would be, I think in the past you've identified the U.S. market, broadly speaking, it's about 100,000 patients. Relative to current SAPIEN technology, what percentage of that with the current approvals do you think you're addressing? And the follow-up question is, given the evolving economic that you discussed, Mike, is there a contemplation in the near term that perhaps there would be some pricing considerations you would be giving to various hospitals and various geographies, who obviously are -- in some sort of smaller metropolitan areas we're obviously hearing that they're having a little bit more trouble with the economics than the larger ones. So could you talk about your pricing strategies near term?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Just to be specific, I don't know where the 100,000 number came from, Jason.  When we built this, we built this out of the 260,000. We feel like with a transfemoral and the transapical approach that we still have the ability to treat most patients. The transapical became very important particularly with this -- the large French size of SAPIEN. So, no, we don't the market really limited from that perspective. In terms of pricing, you all know how expensive this is to be able to bring this technology to the market and to demonstrate all the clinical evidence that we generate. And we think our pricing continues to be fair. Of course, we'll reward high-volume centers with more attractive pricing, but I wouldn't expect any substantial changes in our pricing picture, Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted just to start with going through maybe just at the high level, if you could provide some perspective on what's really changed in your thinking about 2013. And I understand that there are some macro economic factors. But as I look at the original guidance and some of these segments, whether it's a surgical heart valve business, that business was obviously very pressured in 2012. The guidance that you originally provided for 2013 assumed a turnaround. So I guess I'm really wondering, as you look at the guidance that you provided today, how much are you banking on things getting better versus taking what you now see as reality and extrapolating that forward?","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure, I'm happy to get into it, David. Out of the change that we provided in our sales guidance, remember that a big piece of that is foreign exchange. So you can sort of set that aside. That was either $35 million from the investor conference or $30 million since the last time we talked. Separate from that, there was a component of that, that was related to Critical Care. The component that wasn't FX there was largely related to this change in our inventory in China. In heart valves, the change in addition to what we already talked about that's climate related was also related to this competitor in Japan that launched a little bit early. And the biggest single change is in the U.S. THV. That change in guidance was around $40 million. If we say that about a quarter of that already happened in the first quarter, David, this is a reflection that we're off to a slower start. And so that would be the key changes aside from the macro ones that we're explaining.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the U.S. business. I was a little bit surprised to hear the commentary regarding 20 sites canceling their TA training. My additional readout on the net stocking numbers, that you might have been transitioning to consignment faster. But it sounds like the dynamic is that you blew through the bolus of patients and TA and now sort of taking a little bit longer to get sites up and running. Is there any more detail you can provide us on why these sites are canceling and what do you think it's going to take to get them to, A, go through training; and then, B, really get up the curve in doing procedures?","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure, David, let me get into it. On the 20, I don't know that I would say they canceled, but we would say that they postponed. And we didn't expect 20 sites to postpone. There were a variety of reasons for why they did. Some would say, gee, they're waiting for their hybrid OR to be completed. Some might say that the surgical teams, for one reason or another, weren't ready to be trained. Some people cited waiting for TAo before they actually jumped into it. So there were a variety of reasons, but those 20 sites would have probably generated something in the neighborhood of $5 million or more of stocking sales, which we did not realize in the quarter.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then last, just on the R&D spending. It looked -- does look like that there was -- that you're continuing to spend at a very high level. And if you're willing to provide any further detail on what's in those numbers, that'll be helpful. And if not, when do you think we can start to see what's sort of beneath their kimono, so to speak, there?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, well, as we tried to suggest, the key component of that is we have a lot of heart valve clinical trials going on right now. And I tried to tick through an awful lot of those in the course of our commentary. Those consume more than 50% of the R&D budget for Edwards Lifesciences. So we're continuing to follow PARTNER patients. You've got PARTNER II and you've got the trials that are going on in surgical heart valves. You've got some of the other things that are related to registries. So when you add it up, it's pretty substantial. Separate from that, we've got the R&D programs that we cited in each of our businesses and what we have going in advanced technology. So the combination of those are pretty significant. We think that we're excited about the prospects of those investments generating future sales. And so we've really been hesitant to pull back on that and continue to think that that's a good investment of our funds.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Mike, let me start with a long-term question. You have Japan coming on that should help your growth 2014. But could you talk about what's going to drive your growth in 2015 and 2016 before we have the PARTNER IIa indication approved? Because I assume this year the guidance is for 10% underlying growth, but what -- how are you going to maintain that kind of growth beyond -- between 2015 and '16? And then I have one follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I wasn't prepared to actually go through that in detail, but I could take a shot at it for your -- just to answer your question, Larry. We think that the SAPIEN technology is going to continue to grow. Those referral patterns and those patients are going to continue to come off the sidelines and that's going to grow. In Europe, we should be bringing our new lower profile technologies into being and so SAPIEN 3 and CENTERA have an opportunity to lift those. In our heart valve area, we have INTUITY that should be hitting its stride and lifting the growth rate of surgical heart valves. We have an opportunity for our noninvasive technology and our glucose to be lifting our growth rates, within Critical Care, we have MIS products within our CSS product line, which should be lifting it. So we think there's a - we think we have a pretty good lineup, a pretty good -- it was noted earlier how much we have invested in R&D. We have quite a lineup of new things that have an opportunity to lift us.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. My second question, Mike, I'm sorry to sound like a broken record, but is there any color you can give us on mitral first-in-man timing?","Michael A. Mussallem","Well, I'll just reiterate what we said at the time of the investor conference, that we thought it was likely that we're able to do it first-in-man in the mitral position this year. And we haven't been deterred on that. And so given that it's April, that means that we're that much closer and we continue to express the same sentiment. This is one that I hesitate to say too much before we know because we set some pretty high internal hurdles. Before we go to a first-in-man, we want to make sure that we check all those boxes and feel comfortable about that before we do it. But we continue to feel excited about the mitral opportunity. It's a big one, it's a big one for the company, it's a big one for patients. And we're hopeful that this is going to be a year where we have a novel first-in-man.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Imron Zafar with Jefferies.","Imron Zafar - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just trying to understand the TAVI guidance a little bit better. Can you talk about volume trends that you're seeing in Cohort A patients versus Cohort B patients? And also TA versus TF delivery, was there underperformance in one segment versus the other in these categories?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, one of the things that I try to note to the extent that it's helpful is that if you strip out clinicals and you take out net stocking orders, that the actual reorder rate was about 20% higher in Q1 compared to Q4. So it gives you some sense of the ramp. You have to be a little bit careful with the split of TA and TF because you still have TA that's being bought on stocking orders. There's a little bit more TF purchases than TA this quarter although they're somewhat similar. But again, the TA was listed by the stocking orders. And also note that you have a very different split outside the U.S. where you have a lower profile SAPIEN XT device. So even though you have the split, trying to do math on that is difficult. We don't have a great handle on how many, which patients are inoperable as opposed to high risk. That tends to be a gray area and we don't really have much that we could offer up on that front. I don't know if I answered your question, but happy to take a follow-up.","Imron Zafar - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","No, that helps. And in terms of the U.S. target centers, going forward, I think last quarter you mentioned 200 new centers over the next 2 years. What's the updated target there? And is there any change in the strategy in terms of focusing more on utilization at existing centers versus more resources on adding new centers?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. We don't have a formal update on the 200 centers to be added over the next 2 years. It's still a reasonable estimate. I think we infer that, that would be about 100 this year, 100 next year. I would say the 100 this year is probably at the high end of the estimate. I don't expect it to be above that, but there's still a number of centers that want to get in. There are a few centers, maybe 1 or 2, that have cited economics for not coming in, but for the most part there continues to be strong demand. Was there another part of your question?","Imron Zafar - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes. I just wondered if there was any revisiting of the longer-term strategy of maybe focusing more on existing centers and driving utilization at those centers versus...","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, it's a great question. I would say a lot of our growth has continued to come out of existing centers with well developed patterns. And there is a steep learning curve that's going on right now in all centers. There are capacity constraints and we hear it on all kinds of shapes and sizes. So we hear some that they need to, for example, get another nurse coordinator to do patient screening. We heard from some that they need to get additional days set aside in the cath lab and the ORs. We hear from others that it's time to get a second team up. So there's a variety of those things going on, some people building hybrid ORs that aren't finished yet. So if -- there's not one single theme that I can put my finger on that says it's going to relieve the capacity constraints. Our sales teams are engaged heavily with each of their sites trying to help them through their capacity increases.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mike, I'm wondering if you can discuss U.S. volumes, U.S. SAPIEN volumes in the quarter. Were they soft throughout the quarter, things maybe better in March? Maybe some color as to how the quarter progressed.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, that's a tough one. I mean, we know how that went. It was pretty slow start to the quarter, but it's hard for us to say that it was really a steep ramp after that. So January was our softest month and we saw a pretty steady ramp after that. So I don't know if that helps provide any color, Glenn.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. No, that's fine. And then the 20 sites on TA that postponed, should we assume that they come back in the second quarter and therefore we should be modeling stocking that's closer to $10 million?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. We would expect that they would eventually get trained whether it be on TA or even to those sites that talk about TAo, our system could potentially -- well, the short answer, yes, they'd be trained. Now remember that even though we expect to have those stocking orders come in, Glenn, there is going to be some offset for consignment. And so I think when we try to provide some help on this, we thought that net stocking would be somewhat of a lift in the first part of the year and not so much in the back part. But you know what, as the business gets bigger, net stocking is going to start to become a smaller and smaller part of total sales and so it will have a diminishing impact.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But if these 20 states -- sites do get trained this quarter, we could get a lift from stocking in 2Q and then a slow ramp thereafter, is that a fair modeling assumption?","Michael A. Mussallem","Well, yes, I do think that, that's true. We should get a lift from that. But again, I'm not in a position to predict exactly how the net stocking is going to turn out, Glenn.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then one last quick question. Of the PARTNER sites, when we talk to the partner sites, they're maxed out. They're doing 8 to 10 cases a week. And clearly, where the slowing is occurring is in the non-partner site. And you talked about how some of these sites are having a hard time developing referral patterns. Is there anything Edwards can do to help these sites develop these referral patterns faster, so that the ramp could -- can reaccelerate?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. I didn't put a big emphasis on referral patterns. I think that's one that's going to have an impact on a long-term basis. I don't know how much of an impact it's really having in the near term. But to be specifically -- or to speak specifically to your question, there are several things that we're doing that we think can have long-term impact. One we mentioned before is we've engaged with the American College of Cardiology on the championing care initiative, which is really designed to train cardiologists and then ultimately general practitioners in the treatment of aortic stenosis. And there's a big need for that. The American Heart Association is developing a section on their website to actually speak to patients with aortic stenosis. That's never been there in the past. Edwards has helped launched a new patient-focus site called yournewheartvalve.com (sic) [yourheartvalve.com], which helps direct patients that are wondering what they might do about their aortic stenosis. So there are a number of things going on right now, Glenn, that I think will be helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Mike, a couple of questions, just a general one to start with. I know it can be fun to have a guidance for the U.S. Help us think why you're confident that you've got the correct range now given the understandable surprises as the new procedure gets rolled out and the complication around referrals and reimbursement, et cetera.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Rick. You could imagine when we have a very novel innovative technology like this, there are so many variables that go into the rate of adoption. And we try hard to model that. And we've got a very talented group with an awful lot of feedback. We're very close to our clinicians in our sites and do our best, but we're not able to get that just perfect. What we always try to do is share our best insight or our best knowledge. And we believe that what we're sharing right now is our most accurate picture of how we think the U.S. is going to turn out in 2013. We're fortunate that we -- we've got the first quarter under our belts. So we know that, so I would imagine there'd be less risk in it now than when we were making those estimates in December. And so we're just that much more confident this is the right level.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, but when you think about it sequentially, Mike, and I don't know if it's the right way to think about it, let's just assume clinical trial sales and net stocking are sort of -- somewhat like the first quarter. I mean, it still seems like we should see -- the math could be something like 20% sequential growth in commercial sales. Is that too aggressive a thought, do you think?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, in terms of what are the range of possibilities, there are probably -- it's fair that the range are large. Given the dynamics, what we remind ourselves, Rick, is that if each of the 200 centers that we started the quarter with just did one more case in the quarter, that would've resulted in $6 million more sales. And so we're very sensitive to slight changes in almost every variable. And so, yes, it's always possible that we do better than this, but we're sharing this guidance as what we think is the clearest picture, the way we see it today.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And just one last quick one. When does net stocking turn negative in 2013?","Michael A. Mussallem","So far we've gotten in trouble trying to predict exactly what net stocking will do because there's so many variables. We think generally that it's a positive influence in the first half and it turns negative in the second half. But again, it starts to be a smaller percentage of total, Rick, so I think it gets -- it starts diminishing as an important impact over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mike, just to kind of, I guess, follow along with Rick's question just on the confidence with 2013. I guess, how should we -- I guess I'm having a hard time reconciling kind of entering the year, having confidence in 2013, now we're kind of taking some numbers down but yet you guys are still very confident in the longer-term outlook for the technology. I recognize that there's a very large, from a prevalence perspective, amount of patients out there with aortic stenosis. But how do you just think about that dynamic but then also considering the fact that there actually are constraints as you mentioned affecting this year like economics, which probably aren't going to get better and then capacity constraints? So I guess, why not kind of change, I guess, the outlook longer term unless you expect the economics or capacity issues to really flesh out, which doesn't seem to be a likely scenario...","Michael A. Mussallem","No, no, thanks, Kristen. Yes, well, actually, maybe we have a little different view. We do think that economics improve and we do think capacity improves over time. Here you have this disease that's just a devastating disease for these patients and we're still early in the experience of these centers. They're on a learning curve. They're still building their capacity. They're far from efficient at this point. And that's growing. The economics, there's 2 components to the economics. One is the reimbursement and admittedly that changes slowly, but I would imagine that there would be changes to improve that over time. But more importantly is the cost side of this. And the cost side, this is driven by things like length of stay, like the actual procedure intensity itself, its complications. All those are improving, which should improve the economics. So we think there's a number of factors that improve over time. They are more difficult in the short term than they are in the long term.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the surgical valve business. Could you just maybe give us what the underlying rate of growth was there in the U.S., as well as outside the U.S.?","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure. Let me take a look. So the U.S. underlying rate of growth was, I think, in the low to mid-single digits, so sort of in the 3 to 5 range as a growth rate. Negative. I don't know if I said that, but that's what I wanted to make sure that you were clear. Sorry about that.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So U.S. surgical valve business was down low to mid-single digits?","Michael A. Mussallem","That's correct.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And is that because of selling days or you think just the overall market was softer or competition...","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. There was a one less sales day, which is worth about a minus 2. So a component of that was sales days, Kristen. But the market wasn't particularly robust either in our view. We don't feel like we took a share hit.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, just a couple of cleanups here. So our math just based on the numbers you gave suggest that the number of centers in the U.S. that were put -- had shifted to consignment this quarter was actually less than the number that shifted in the fourth quarter. Do you have that in front of you? Is that right?","Michael A. Mussallem","Boy, I don't know that. I can tell you, Michael, that right now I think there's about half of the centers that are somewhere going through the consignment process. But I wouldn't be able to put my finger on it because this consignment number, once somebody starts on consignment, each valve they use moves to consignment, so it gets to be variable. It's not easy to do, to back out the accounting. It's one unit at a time.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. The surgical valve commentary, the conversation you just had with Kristen. What about the view or the thesis, Mike, that the launch of TA and the focus of surgeons in the U.S. now in TA is taking them away from doing surgical valve cases and that you're seeing more cannibalization, at least early on, than what we saw in Europe?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, it's possible that that's the case. There's also some theory out there that there's an awful lot of valve trials going on in the U.S. at this point, as well, that could be tapping off some volume. So those could be factors that are influencing the surgical valve growth. Again, our pricing is solid. We don't feel like we're losing share. It's just not generating much growth right now.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. 2 other quick once. So one question I got from a lot of people between the press release and the call was, why didn't the company preannounce given the shortfall here on the top and bottom line and the change to guidance? Why did you guys sit on this until tonight?","Michael A. Mussallem","We feel like this was sort of within our -- within the norms of reporting the way we do right now, Mike. So we didn't feel like there was any need to preannounce.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then last one. Given the quarter, given your lowered growth outlook for the year, given the obviously increased questions here from the Street, has your view on acquisitions changed at all, Mike, and your appetite for doing anything that might be a larger deal?","Michael A. Mussallem","No, we're long-run guys, Mike. So when we think about acquisitions, we think about how we create long-term value. We think about what kind of things that suit Edwards. We have a very focused strategy around structural heart disease and critical care technologies. And so any acquisitions we think about are those that would provide growth particularly in those areas, where we're leaders. And so our philosophy, overall, has not changed.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But no bigger deals?","Michael A. Mussallem","We don't particularly -- our history, Mike, is to look at technology deals. We always consider a full range of options, but I can't tell you that there's really been any change in our view.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mike, in your prepared comments you were talking a little bit about European competition impacting o U.S. TAVI. Could you flesh that out a little bit more? To what extent does it impact numbers? And how is it playing through in terms of pricing in the European market?","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure. Yes, I would say for the first time we felt that competitors in the non-transfemoral competitor -- the non-transfemoral segment took some share. We estimate that maybe about 10% -- it's maybe 10% of that alternate access position, overall. So that's what it would look like. That's probably something in the order of maybe 150 units in the quarter, the bulk of those all in Germany.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And secondly, I know you talked about 20 or so sites that have postponed procedures. I'm wondering in the U.S. market, is there any dynamic of centers who were trained and performing the procedures that have decided that transapical -- I'm sorry, that TAVI is just no longer a procedure they want to offer because of economics or any other reason?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I'm not aware of anybody that has walked away and stopped doing TAVI based on economics. You asked the question earlier, too, about pricing in Europe. If I hadn't mentioned it earlier, it's continued on a similar trend what we've seen in the past, about 3% year-over-year decline principally driven by the volume discounts that we give in large centers.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just, Mike, the question I asked, the second question in terms of centers walking away, I meant for economics or any other reason. And I think you just answered it strictly on economics.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, no, I didn't mean to say that I'm aware of any centers that have walked away from TAVI, that I'm aware of.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray.","Misha Dinerman","This is actually Misha Dinerman for Brooks West. Mike, in your opening comments you noted that TA backlog has been addressed, but it sounds like the TA sites are still postponed. So I was wondering if you could comment on that a little bit.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. I guess what I was trying to refer to is in advance of the approval of Cohort A, we believe that sites were, more or less, sort of saving up their patients that didn't have good femoral access for a transapical approach. Given that we got that approval in late October of last year, we don't think those patients are still around. We think those patients have been treated. This is not the kind of disease that here we are almost 6 months later, that they would still be there. So the TA cases have gone very well. They've had a high procedural success rate. We actually wonder here whether some of the cases that'd previously be done transfemorally were maybe borderline transfemoral cases, now that there's a TA approach, actually are being done by TA.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a quick question for you. Did you -- if I missed it, forgive me. But did you give the breakout in revenues for TF versus TA in the quarter? I think you did last quarter.","Michael A. Mussallem","I think, I mentioned that in the U.S. -- in Europe, I think our mix has been running around 70% TF, 30% TAA (sic) [TA]. So I think the market might be slightly richer than that, but that's our mix at this point. What I said was that we had much more growth on the TF side and actually some decline on the TA side.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And on the sales and marketing side, as you think about the progression through the year and you gave us some guidance on the percentages, but what would it take for you to think about those spending levels differently as you go through the year, say you had another disappointing quarter on trans basis like this in the second quarter?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, we try and discipline our sales and marketing expenses. You saw even our expenses this quarter a little lower probably because of some of the incentive comp that goes along in follow sales. But our focus is on really driving the growth. We think there's a lot of unmet need out there and we try and really line up our resources to be focused on that. And then those that aren't focused on driving growth, we try and be very thoughtful and judicious about how we apply that. So the estimates that Tom offered of an SG&A rate of around 37% for the remainder of the year, we think is a pretty reasonable way to think about us in 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike and Tom, it looks like based on that $350 million to $400 million guidance and about 30-ish in clinical and 0 in net stocking, it's working out to like $320 million to $370 million in guidance for U.S. commercial sales. First, simple question, is that the right way to be thinking about it? And then given the fact that it's probably going to take time to recruit the unreferred prevalence pool of patients, should we be thinking that 2014 PARTNER I opportunity is somewhere between $400 million and $500 million?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, let me take a shot at your first question. In terms of what we're guiding to, that was everything that included clinical and net stocking. We don't know how net stocking is actually going to work out. It's not going to be a big number one way or another. And so the difference probably between our estimate and what you're trying to calculate are the clinical sales. And if you just took the clinical sales this quarter and took them times 4, it probably wouldn't be a bad estimate to use for how it might turn out for the year. I'm sure it's not perfect, but it's not a bad estimate. Does that answer that part of the question?","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And the second question really was, given the work you're going to have to do to draw out the unreferred prevalence pool, should we be thinking about the 2014-ish market potential for PARTNER I in the $400 million to $500 million range if, in fact, this year's commercial sales are somewhere between $320 million and $370 million?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. We're not ready to forecast 2014, Bruce. The things that are going on right now in addition to the work that I mentioned earlier that we're doing with the societies and so forth, there's also work going on with each individual site. And those sites are probably the most powerful generators of improving their capacity, improving their economics and working on their referral networks. And so I expect there to be progress on all those fronts, but it's too early for us to offer 2014 guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Nam with Janney.","Spencer Nam - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask you just a couple of quick questions on the center behaviors and then kind of how you guys looked at the outlook. First of all, you guys talked about 200 centers signed up as of last December and then another 200 joining the program by end of next year, 2014. With this sort of the recent activities, do you now have a different view on that, or how do you guys think about some ramp up here with the program?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. No, we don't have a different view of that. As I mentioned at the end of this quarter, we're just over 225, so we're tracking just on that rate. But this is the one that as we get more visibility, we'll let you know, but that estimate is our current reasonable estimate.","Spencer Nam - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of once the centers get trained and signed up, for example, what sort of ramp-up period do they have in terms of doing cases? It seems like the time it takes for a center from a consignment stance to fully functional, if you will, is taking a little longer than we had previously expected, is that fair?","Michael A. Mussallem","It's tough to generalize, Spencer. As you know, when they come to training, they bring some cases with them and then generally they get proctored immediately thereafter. So usually something in the neighborhood of 5 cases usually happen in pretty short order after their training. And then generally because they place stocking orders, they have a certain level of commitment to continue. But it's highly variable for a whole host of reasons, so I'm not sure that I can provide much help on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Swann.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Mike, I was hoping you could follow-up on a comment you made about reimbursement and potential improvements there and help us understand what that could mean -- what improvements you're talking about and then when we could see that, number one. And then number two, I was hoping you could comment on the potential penetration into the moderate-risk patient population, particularly after the GARY data we saw in APC and how, if at all, that changes your view of potentially penetrating that patient population?","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure. Yes, I think that there's a couple of kinds of reimbursements. There's physician reimbursement and that would get -- that's going to get readdressed. That'll be -- that happens routinely, pretty much happens on an annual basis and so that will get dressed. In terms of the overall DRG system, that that's to be slower moving. It takes some time. I think generally people think it takes a couple of years here before CMS reassesses a DRG. But over time, they try and reassess. And then so these things aren't frozen in time was my inference. In terms of the GARY registry and whether it had impact, we really have not seen any negative impact. I think one of the things that I mentioned is actually Germany itself is one of our fastest growing countries in Europe. It doesn't change our view of how attractive this is going to be for patients. If you look at the -- that have -- patients that are current surgical patients, if you look at the 3-year ACC data, which we think is far more important data than the GARY data, we found that comparing the SAPIEN valve to surgery was looking quite attractive. They were equivalent and it becomes a very interesting option for these high-risk patients. So we think that PARTNER II, which is going to get into it in a bigger way, is going to demonstrate that even greater. The early look that you had in PARTNER IIB highlights the benefits of XP and the lower profile and the improved vascular complication. So we think this just gets better for these moderate-risk patients.","Operator","We have time for one final question today. And it comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mike, just one question; one financially related for Tom. I guess, Mike, the question I keep on getting during the call was going on is some of the dynamics you're talking about on the short term, you don't get materially better in the next 6 to 12 months, but you're also very confident that the total opportunity for SAPIEN remains sort of unchanged. So is a fair way of thinking about this is it's the same total market opportunity, but maybe you get to that level of penetration or that opportunity 6 months, 12 months or 2 years later than you would have thought?","Michael A. Mussallem","I was going to give Tom a chance to answer a question here so...","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I've got a second one for Tom.","Michael A. Mussallem","He hasn't been very popular.","Thomas M. Abate","No, he had the second part was me.","Michael A. Mussallem","Okay. Now to the first one, yes, that may well be the case. I mean, I hesitate to change a view of a market after one more quarter. As we see things sort of unveil itself, David, we'll have a sharper view  of what we think this looks like in the long term. But the premise that you lay out there, that it may take a little longer to get these patients, that's one explanation, that might be it. It's just too soon for us to have a clear view and we'll certainly sharpen that up over time.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, Tom, I promised to give you a financial question here. If we think about the guidance, specifically on earnings, the call focus more on revenue, if I adjust for the top line, really THV sales, work it down at a high contribution, the earnings reduction kind of makes sense to me. But I guess what made less sense was it looks like the way you're approaching the sales and spending this year is relatively similar adjusted for that revenue. And given Mike's commentary on seeing less traction at smaller centers, I guess I was surprised that you're seeing that relative contribution to earnings. And I'm wondering, has there been any change to sales and your spending expectations for '13 based on what you're seeing in the marketplace? And if this were to continue into next quarter, do you think then we'd start to see a change in how you're thinking about sales spending in the U.S.?","Thomas M. Abate","No, it's a good question. We looked at expenses and we looked hard, but what we tried to do very much is to make sure that everything and anything that was directed at sales growth was preserved. So we've done some things. You also have to remember that when we do something like this to top and bottom line, we're talking sales growth adjustment and EPS adjustment, there's adjustments to the incentive programs inside the company. So there's a piece of that, that might be misleading you when you're looking at ratios and so forth. So some of it's that. Now we're convinced that this is all the growth opportunity we've ever had and it's just -- we might have to work a little harder, so spending is probably not the place we would go short term.","Michael A. Mussallem","Okay. Well, thanks, everyone. We appreciate your continued interest in Edwards. Tom and David and I will welcome any additional questions by telephone.

At this time, all, participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce David Erickson, VP, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please begin.","David Erickson","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our fourth quarter 2017 financial results. During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and the accompanying financial schedules and then we will use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Scott Ullem, CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and current expectations for new product approvals, benefits and introductions, clinical and regulatory timelines, competitive matters, expectations for therapy adoption and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today.","Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important safety information about products may be found in our press release, our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, all of which are available on our website at edwards.com.","Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying and adjusted, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release and on our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem","Thank you, David. We're pleased to report robust fourth quarter results including double-digit organic revenue growth in each region driven by increased adoption of our therapies. We ended the quarter strong with total adjusted sales of $909 million representing 16% underlying growth as we did not experience as much of a slowdown as we typically see in the last weeks of the year.","Our growth rates strengthened in the fourth quarter contributing to full year 2017 results of 16% underlying growth and over $3.4 billion of sales. Each of our product lines performed very well as demand for our innovative portfolio exceeded our expectations. Profitability was also strong in 2017 with adjusted EPS growing over 30% even as we continued to invest aggressively in our technology pipeline and infrastructure. And we continue to bring meaningful therapies to large unmet patient needs and further strengthen our leadership positions. ","Turning to transcatheter heart valve therapy adjusted global sales were $540 million up 22% on an underlying basis over the prior year including the adjustment for the consumption of stocking inventory in Germany. Double-digit TAVR sales growth across all regions was driven by continued strong therapy adoption and our average selling price remained stable overall. In the U.S. transcatheter heart valve sales for the quarter were $327 million representing 22% growth versus the prior year. We believe overall U.S. procedure growth was roughly in line with our growth. These strong results were driven by robust therapy adoption across the more than 575 TAVR centers with particularly strong growth in lower volume hospitals. And our best in class SAPIEN 3 valve continued to provide excellent outcomes including faster patient recovery, enhanced quality of life, and exceptional value to this healthcare system. ","We continue to be encouraged by the strong international adoption of TAVR particularly when overall therapy penetration is still relatively low. Outside the U.S. our fourth quarter underlying sales growth rate was 22% with all regions contributing. Double-digit procedure growth in Europe continued this quarter and our growth was also aided by a recovery from the interruption in fresh sales last year. Growth in countries with lower TAVR adoption rates continued to outpace countries where therapy is more established. And we continue to see strong TAVR therapy adoption in Japan driven by SAPIEN 3 and new centers continue to become qualified. As our fastest growing region this quarter we believe the aortic stenosis still remains a large undertreated disease in Japan.","Turning to our near-term product pipeline we continue to expect a CE Mark for our SAPIEN 3 Ultra system this quarter. This system features advancements designed to help TAVR heart teams simplify procedures and reduce the risk of complications. The Ultra system also adds to TAVR outer [ph] on the valve which is designed to further improve its outstanding performance and we continue to expect the U.S. introduction of this system in late 2018. Additionally we expect to receive CE Mark for our CENTERA system this month which we will introduce as a premium self expanding system. We remain enthused by this feature rich platform and encouraged by its excellent early clinical results and we plan to initiate a U.S. pivotal trial in 2018.","As noted in our December Investor Conference we've completed enrolment in the main study of our PARTNER 3 trial for low risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. We anticipate data from this trial will be presented at ACC 2019 and to receive FDA approval later that year. We are also enrolling our groundbreaking early TAVR trial, the first of its kind to study severe aortic stenosis patients without diagnosed symptoms. In summary based on our momentum we now expect our 2018 THVT underlying sales growth to be at the higher end of our 11% to 15% range that we shared at our investor conference in December.","Turning to surgical heart valve therapy, sales for the fourth quarter were $205 million that are up 6% on an underlying basis driven by strong unit growth of aortic valves across all regions and share gains driven by new products. Adoption of our INTUITY valve system in the U.S. has been impressive and aided by the CMS new technology add on payment that went into effect on October 1st. Utilization this quarter increased in centers already using INTUITY as well as new hospitals adopting this rapid deployment valve. This therapy is becoming a meaningful portion of our surgical portfolio and remains on track to represent approximately 25% of global aortic sales in 2018.","Interests in our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve in Europe is increasing as it offers an attractive option for active patients. The INSPIRIS valve features our latest RESILIA tissue and our VFit feature designed to accommodate future TAVR. Last month we began the U.S. launch and continue to expect to introduce a new class of resilient tissue valves in Japan this year pending reimbursement approval. We're pleased to announce that we recently received CE Mark for Harpoon, our recently acquired beating heart mitral valve repair system. We are currently focused on integration activities and expect a midyear 2018 launch in Europe. While we are enthused by this innovative therapy to treat degenerative mitral regurgitation we expect sales to ramp slowly as we focus on achieving a high procedural success rate. ","In summary in surgical heart valve therapy we continue to expect a full year 2018 underlying sales growth rate of 2% to 4%. In critical care sales for the quarter $164 million and grew 11% on an underlying basis. This performance was driven by strong growth across the product portfolio and most notably in the U.S. where hospitals utilized their year-end capital budgets. Growth was also aided by Asia Pacific which grew in double-digits on a smaller base. ","During the fourth quarter expansion into the global enhanced surgical recovery opportunity continued aided by our non-invasive clear sight solution primarily in the U.S. and China. As hospitals continued to adopt ESR to improve patient outcomes we expect this program to be a significant growth driver in critical care over the longer-term. We're also pleased to expand the launch of HemoSphere our next generation advanced monitoring platform which is expected to be an important growth driver in 2018 and beyond. HemoSphere is designed to provide greater clarity on a patients hemodynamic status to enable clinicians to make timely, potentially lifesaving decisions. In summary we continued to expect full year 2018 underlying sales growth in critical care of 6% to 8%. ","Turning to transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities in our transcatheter therapies to treat patients suffering from tricuspid and mitral disease. We have estimated this to be a $3 billion plus opportunity by 2025. Today I will cover some select updates. Beginning with transcatheter mitral repair, during the quarter we continued the enrolment of U.S. patients in the active trial for cardio band in the mitral position. We will remind you we already have CE Mark for this product in Europe and in the fourth quarter we recorded in THVT approximately $1 million in commercial sales. ","In the fourth quarter we prioritized supply to our clinical trials and began integrating the Cardioband supply chain into the Edwards quality system. We expect sales to continue at a modest level in Q1 and ramp to approximately $15 million for the full year 2018. We believe that the annual reduction provided by Cardioband can be an important first line therapy for many mitral patients. We expect to complete enrolment this year of the class CE Mark trial for our PASCAL transcatheter mitral repair program and we're on track to initiate our PASCAL U.S. trial in 2018. We're encouraged by our early clinical experience and our European launch remains planned for 2019.","In mitral valve replacement we're strong believers in our transseptal strategy. We're making good clinical progress with both our Edwards CardiAQ and SAPIEN M3 replacement platforms that are being implanted percutaneously and we're encouraged by our learnings and the cadence of early feasibility cases. In our tricuspid repair therapies we're pleased to report that we have received approval to begin our Cardioband tricuspid U.S. early feasibility study and we're working to activate centers in the first half of 2018. Our CE Mark trial continued to enroll and we remain on track to begin an introduction by the end of this year. Overall we remain optimistic about our portfolio of transcatheter mitral and tricuspid offerings and achieving our significant clinical milestones in 2018. And we continue to aggressively invest to realize our goal of it launching at least one new therapy per year. ","Before I turn the call over to Scott I'll remind you that in the fourth quarter we received $113 million from our successful Neovasc litigation regarding theft of trade secrets. At the same time we made a $25 million contribution to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation whose mission is to support health and community focused charitable organizations. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott. ","Scott B. Ullem","Thanks Mike. I am pleased to report that our strong finish to the year enabled us to exceed our sales, earnings, and free cash flow targets for 2017. For the full year sales increased 16% on an underlying basis to $3.4 billion, adjusted earnings per share includes 31% to $3.80 and we generated $695 million of adjusted free cash flow.","Turning to the fourth quarter our strong sales performance in transcatheter valves drove significant top and bottom line growth versus the prior year. Underlying sales grew 16% and adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $0.94. GAAP earnings per share was $0.17 driven by several onetime adjustments including a non-cash charge of $211 million or $0.98 per share related primarily to the enactment of the new U.S. tax law partially offset by a gain from litigation Mike mentioned. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release and I'll provide further details on the impact of tax reform a bit later. ","I'll now cover the details of our results and then discuss guidance for 2018. For the fourth quarter our gross profit margin was 73.5% compared to 72.2% in the same period last year. This improvement primarily reflects a benefit of a more profitable product mix led by growing sales of TAVR partially offset by expenses associated with the planned closure of our manufacturing plant in Switzerland which was announced last year. We continue to expect our 2018 gross profit margin excluding special items to be between 74% and 76%. Our rate should be lifted by an improved product mix but tempered by capacity investments.","Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $267 million or 30% of sales compared to $234 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by personnel related and performance based compensation expenses and a strengthening of the euro against the dollar. We continue to expect SG&A excluding special items to be between 28% and 29% of sales for the full year 2018 which includes the continued suspension of the medical device excise tax until 2020. Research and development investments in the quarter grew 28% to $147 million or 16.5% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs including spending on clinical trials. For the full year 2018 we continued to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be between 16% and 17%.","Turning to taxes, our high reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was driven by a $211 million expense related primarily to the implementation of U.S. tax law changes. The expanse is comprised of $289 million of tax on unremitted foreign earnings which is payable over the next eight years. This amount is offset by $65 million related to adjustments of tax accounts arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate and a $13 million discrete benefit from a tax audit settlement. Excluding the impact of tax reform and other special items, our tax rate would have been 21.3%. This rate includes an approximate 200 basis benefits from the new accounting for employee stock based compensation consistent with our guidance.","Starting in 2018 the benefit of our lower U.S. tax rate will be partially offset by a higher foreign minimum tax and other items. We expect the net impact from tax reform to lower our effective tax rate in 2018 by approximately 300 basis points. We now expect our 2018 tax rate excluding special items to be between 15% and 18% which includes an estimated 2% to 3% point benefit from employee stock based compensation accounting rules implemented in 2017. Foreign exchange rates increased fourth quarter sales by approximately 2% compared to the prior year. Compared to our October guidance FX rates positively impacted earnings per share by less than a penny. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $174 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $364 million, less capital spending of $77 million, and excluding the receipt of the $113 million litigation payment mentioned earlier. For the full year 2017 adjusted free cash flow was $695 million.","Turning to our balance sheet, at the end of the quarter we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $1.3 billion, the majority of which is held outside the United States. Total debt was approximately $1 billion. In November 2017 we entered into an accelerated share purchase agreement for $150 million. In total we repurchased 2.3 million shares during the quarter for $251 million. As a result of these repurchases average shares outstanding during the quarter declined to $215 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2018 to be between $213 million and $215 million.","And I'll finish up with our 2018 guidance. Given our strong fourth quarter momentum combined with the strengthening of the euro at current exchange rates we now expect to be at the higher end of all of our 2018 full year sales guidance ranges communicated at investor conference in New York in December. Those ranges are $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion for transcatheter heart valve therapy. For surgical heart valve therapy, %810 million to $850 million and for critical care $610 million to $650 million, for total Edwards $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion.","The full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share we expect to between $4.43 and $4.63 up from $4.10 to $4.30 driven by a lower projected tax rate and higher projected operating performance. This includes the investment of a significant portion of the tax savings to accelerate growth initiatives consistent with our strategy. Lastly, we now expect full year 2018 free cash flow to be at the higher end of the $700 million to $775 million range that we shared at our investor conference in December. For the first quarter of 2018 we project total sales to be between $900 million and $950 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 to $1.14 and with that I will hand it back to Mike. ","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks Scott. Our strong 2017 reinforces our confidence on our focused innovation strategy and our longer-term outlook and we look forward to an exciting 2018 as we continue to aggressively invest in our future. We expect to achieve a number of important milestone supporting progress in the development of transformative therapies across all of our product lines. Our differentiated strategy continues to benefit patients and serve us well as we plan for future growth and value creation and we're focused on staying at the forefront by creating strong evidence for promising new therapies for patients we serve in the many years to come. And with that I'll turn it back over to David. ","David Erickson","Thank you Mike. We are ready to take questions now. In order to allow broad participation we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions please reenter the queue and we'll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the call. Operator please go ahead. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed. ","Bob Hopkins","Great, thanks very much for taking the questions and congratulations on such a stronger strong finish to the year. The first question I wanted to ask about was really the TAVR performance in the quarter because obviously it was stronger than I think most everybody was looking for and so maybe I will focus the question on the U.S. performance. Can you just talk about what went on in the quarter in terms of both your performance in the market and really in your minds what drove the outperformance in the quarter, how broad based was it, how sustainable is it, thank you? ","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, thanks Bob. The key driver was therapy adoption. Therapy adoption in the U.S. continues through rapid. We estimated it was somewhat consistent with our own growth so therefore it got over 20%. What was a little different, the other think that I had mentioned in our comments here is the procedures sort of grew broadly across the network but particularly strength in lower volume centers. And so we take that to mean places where there may be a just a lower adoption rate around the U.S. It seemed to grow faster and then we also didn't see the typical seasonal falloff that we see as well. And so that combination of effects was very meaningful and we were very pleased to see it.","Bob Hopkins","The other thing I wanted to ask about was the pipeline because you had some really strong positive updates in your prepared remarks so I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the upcoming CENTERA launch in Europe, how broad it will be, and how you plan on positioning the valve, and then also if you wouldn\u2019t mind talking about Ultra and giving us a sense for the features of that because I think that maybe a product that people don't have as good enough appreciation for it? ","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes so, let me start with CENTERA. As you mentioned that we expect to receive that CE Mark this month and we're really looking forward to launching that. We're going to introduce it as a premium self expanding system. We're very enthused about it. It is feature rich and the early results are terrific with it. The label is still not clear and it's going to be probably a little different by country but we're pleased to be able to launch out and then we expect to bring that to the U.S. later on this year and then begin a trial, an IBE trial later at that time. Ultra, again we're expecting a CE Mark this quarter and it has a lot of advanced features and particularly we think it's going to help simplify these procedures and reduce the risk of complications and this [indiscernible] is not to be underestimated as well. We are so pleased with the performance of SAPIEN 3 already we think Ultra has a chance to even take it to the next level.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. ","Larry Biegelsen","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Scott, at the Analyst Meeting you expected sales growth to ramp through 2018. Is that still the case and could you remind us why that's the case? Thank you. ","Michael A. Mussallem","So originally we did expect sales growth to ramp during the quarters in 2018, now just given the momentum we had coming out of year-end we think that that's probably going to be more consistent growth between quarters during the year.","Larry Biegelsen","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the tax rate Scott, the 15% to 18% relatively wide range, could you talk a little bit about what would get you to the high end and low end on that? Thanks for taking the questions guys and congrats on the quarter.","Scott B. Ullem","Sure, thanks as you know there are still guidance coming out from Treasury and the IRS and the ICPA is asking questions and so there are some uncertainty. We also have the excess tax benefit that could cause fluctuations within the 15% to 18% range but as you know typically I will guide people to the middle of that range for modeling purposes. ","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line or David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","David Lewis","Good afternoon. I wanted to talk about a couple of the big debates during the Analyst Day if I could and Mike maybe one for you and one for you Scott. So Mike I know you talked about the quarter already but as I think about the guide the real focus for investors in Analyst Day was your expectations for market growth seemed more Draconian than I think people were expecting. I think you are obviously taking Q3 guidance to the high end of the range, so relative to your view at Analyst Day Are you clearly feeling better about the market this year so, my real question is that high end of the THVT range do you feel better about the market in 2018 or better about your relative share?","Michael A. Mussallem","So, I think if there is anything changed its really our view of how fast adoption will be for the market the way you say it. That's the change. Naturally as this gets large we naturally assumed it would slow down more and we saw some pretty robust growth in the fourth quarter. We're very pleased by that. We don\u2019t think there is going to be much of a story in terms of our market share in 2018. In 2018 we think that's going to be our relatively flat story so, I don\u2019t know if that gets at your question. ","David Lewis","Thanks, it is perfect Mike. And I think Scott the second question I think margins broadly, I think people left feeling there is more room to go on the margins. The key tree is moving higher, GMs are not so could you talk about some of those capacity investments and where they're going and sales are going higher yet relative margins are not so there is some reinvestment as you mentioned which I think most investors would support. But where are some of those dollars going that are keeping these margins relatively stable in light of the fact that the revenue is growing faster early on the year? Thanks so much.","Scott B. Ullem","Sure, and we are expecting more leverage than we did at the investor conference largely because now we've got better top line growth expectations now. In terms of investments a lot of our investments are going into facilities and expanding our capacity both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. And so we have got pressure on gross margin, headwinds on the gross margin from that perspective. But THV is our highest margin business and we are expecting higher growth now that helps our overall margin performance and leverage to the P&L.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mike Weinstein with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed. ","Michael Weinstein","Thanks for taking the questions. So I just wanted to clarify the guidance update in a couple of different ways. So, you have moved your revenue guidance to the higher end of the range but the overall reported range is not as the dollars moved. So can you share with us on an underlying basis how your guidance's change is underlying in the remaining constant currency and then just on the FX question, so FX getting more favorable into initial guidance, how much is that adding to your 2018 EPS outlook relative to what you are assuming at the time of initial guidance? Thanks. ","Scott B. Ullem","Sure, so as we are moving our sales expectations higher in the ranges that we provided earlier about half of that is driven by FX and half of that is driven by operating performance mostly from THV. And so we are expecting sales results in the higher end of the dollar ranges for all three businesses and at the higher end of the underlying growth rate range for THV but still right in the middle of the underlying growth rate ranges for HVT and critical care because more of their businesses are outside of the U.S.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, just to clarify so it needed to be -- you are looking at 18% what you call underlying which is constant currency and for the other two you are still in the middle of the underlying range?","Scott B. Ullem","So, higher end of that 11% to 15% range for THV and right in the middle of 2% to 4% range for HVT and 6% to 8% range for critical care.","Michael Weinstein","And Scott the EPS swing from FX?","Scott B. Ullem","Yes, so EPS has a number of different contributing factors and if you just isolated FX then it would be reflected by that increase in the non-FX related earnings growth in THV. So in other words about half of the sales increase is FX, the other half is actual underlying performance. And that underlying performance would largely drop through to the bottom line. But there are a lot of other contributing factors as a result of the tax legislation and the incremental investments that we're planning to make with some of the proceeds from those tax benefits.","Michael Weinstein","Yeah, I understand that the tax should be about $0.20 or there about and you reinvesting some of that but I was asking typically to FX, you don\u2019t know what that EPS contribution is relative to the initial guide? ","Scott B. Ullem","Yeah, FX specifically is about $0.03. ","Michael Weinstein","Okay, perfect. And last one I will drop, just to clarify Mike you said the class trial you expected from premium enrollment in 2018 and I think in clinical trial we had at that it was supposed to complete the follow-up in 2018, just want to clarify the expense? ","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, we do expect to complete the class trial in -- complete enrolment in 2018 and we have continued to expect the European launch in 2019. Does that answer your question.","Michael Weinstein","Yes, but we won't see the date in 2018? ","Michael A. Mussallem","I don't know, Mike I suppose that's possible but the odds are that it will go into 2019, that's what I would count on.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, congrats on the quarter Mike. ","Michael A. Mussallem","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. ","Isaac Ro","Hi, good afternoon guys, thank you. Question on your comments around the updated guidance, Mike I think you said that the adoption of therapy has been going a little faster than expected. Well there are handful of events or it seems as you move across the customer base that really drove that increased adoption that you can point to, is there an initiatives with sales, something that effected you guys were able to execute upon in the quarter that allowed you to take a more bullish view? ","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, you know it was funny -- it was quite broad based. So we probably exceeded expectations in every region around the world. So we saw very strong performance out Europe, very strong performance out of Japan, and the U.S. as well and even O.U.S. in places where adoption is very low we saw a contribution. We are making an investment as we mentioned in the past to help with awareness of the disease. And we believe that that is starting to have some kind of impact whether it had a little bit lift to the growth rate, I think our team thinks so but that's difficult to measure at this point. But we are investing some energy and helping identify patients and position communication and trying to facilitate the pathway for patients. And do a little bit work direct to patient and direct to referral around the world. And so that may be making a small contribution but I think it's more that we just have an outstanding procedure here where we are getting just great results and you have patients and physicians gravitating toward it.","Isaac Ro","Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up to the extent that the rest of the year you are obviously working on all those fronts on an ongoing basis, how much do you need the low risk market to play into to achieve the high end of your range, is that something that sort of is in the cards or is it still early for low risk to move the needle this year? ","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, I can tell you, in our guidance we haven\u2019t projected any contribution from low risk. We continue to think that it is an intermediate risk to patient again with severe aortic stenosis, so low risk we would think there would be some kind of impact beginning in 2019. The results of that PARTNER III trial which will powerful, we expect to be available at ACC in 2019 and then the approval come right around that year, so no I would think that you wouldn\u2019t really see low risk impacts in 2018.","Isaac Ro","Got it, thank you guys. ","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. ","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question, and congratulation on a nice quarter here. So Mike you mentioned the -- just some thoughts around the U.S. TAVR performance rate, I am just trying to tie a couple of comments you made, so one, we have seen that number move quite a bit and I think you guys have gone to great length in explaining don\u2019t look at quarterly numbers it moves quite a bit, but then now we have you guys raising guidance towards the high end and I think the other comment was you saw adoption in low volume centers, is this something that we have seen in the past, is that what gives you the confidence here on TAVR, any color I think would be helpful? ","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, you correctly observed that we've been trying to indicate it is difficult for us to be exact in terms of predicting our volume on a quarter-to-quarter basis and it continues to be lumpy. So that's just what it is, but maybe the more important point is the second point that you raise which is what's going on in these lower volume centers. You know part of our theory is remember our belief is maybe only one out of five patients with severe aortic stenosis in the United States actually gets treated. And that if there isn\u2019t a center that was actually doing therapy and let's say these large centers they've been at it for a while. They maybe in the PARTNER trial and then we actually got approval in 2011 so they've been minding their referral base for a while. But new centers we think there may be a referral base there that the physicians and patients are hearing about for the first time. And that maybe stimulating it and we just don\u2019t find that patients flow to centers of excellence like you might imagine. So, new centers opening and center starting to develop their referral base seems to really make a difference. ","Vijay Kumar","Yeah, that's helpful Mike. And then maybe one for Scott on the EPS guidance So, if I had to look at the high-end of the EPS guidance range Scott I was curious, you are saying taxes being completely -- mostly reinvested in the business right, so which would imply for us to get to the high end of the EPS we are expecting margin expansion year-on-year, is it all tied to volume based leverage and our revenues coming in better or is there something going on from a mix perspective, thank you?","Scott B. Ullem","Sure, so for EPS it's not the higher end rapid change in the range and it is going up from the midpoint of the prior range about $0.33. And I know it is all precise but just to break it down in basic terms, if you were to isolate higher sales expectations and to lower tax rates from the tax legislation both would contribute about equally to that higher range.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you guys. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed. ","Jason Mills","Thank you guys for taking the question. As you see in a question. Mike, first on the broader TAVR market, I guess a multipart question, ultimately the growth at the rates that you are now projecting would you put you sort of at that 5 billion rate, that range that you projected over the longer-term maybe a year earlier, could you talk about your long-term projections for the TAVR business and whether or not the -- what you have been informed by with respect to therapy adoption including some of the volume centers and also maybe commenting on that reduction in length to stay which are checked continued to come back positively on that front, how that informs your long-term thinking about this market?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, thanks Jason. You know what we had a great fourth quarter, we had a great year. That really doesn't change our long-term outlook. We continue to feel very good about the idea that this will be more than $5 billion opportunity by 2021 and we will grow in the mid teens. I know we had a quarter here where it was over 20 but we really try and look at this on a longer-term basis and realize that there's going to be some ups and downs probably along the way. So I'm not trying to signal that but it certainly builds our confidence that these are solid estimates that we believe in. Separately you are right about length of state coming down. We find it remarkable the kind of success that we're seeing in the marketplace. Clinicians continue to do procedures very efficiently and length of state has been averaging maybe around three days. It is beginning to decline. There was a study at TCT that showed that they could have outstanding results in just one and two day length of stays. And so I thinks that's a momentum that is building, that doesn't consume so much capacity in hospitals and also has very favorable health economics for them. So we think that's a nice tail wind if you behind this but I didn't try to indicate here that we're necessarily going to get to those goals sooner. We'll keep an eye on that but really no change at this point.","Jason Mills","Thanks, it certainly doesn\u2019t seem like it is going to take longer to get to those goals I guess was my point. But just maybe on a more specific question on CENTERA, can you talk a little bit more about how you are positioned. I have to assume obviously that you expect it to augment your overall franchise instead of cannibalize but I suppose there maybe some cannibalization within some regions or some hospitals through SAPIEN 3, but maybe a higher price you are positioning at a premium product, I guess two questions, is it premium to SAPIEN 3 from an ASP standpoint and then generally speaking the expected to be share accretive as well? And thanks for taking the question. ","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, thanks, so they were primarily going to bring this to those clinicians that are already using self expanding systems and we're going to go there with a simple argument to say we believe that this is the best in class self expanding system. There are some external data and it is a feature rich platform. If they like what they are using now we think they are really going to like CENTERA. Now of course people that are using SAPIEN 3 for the most part they're very happy and obviously it's a leading platform and we think it's best in class and balloon expandable but if those customers wanted to try CENTERA we won't deny that to them. But that's not really going to be the focus of our introduction. It is going to be priced more like SAPIEN 3 at a premium price and so we are not going to try and be competitive with prices and I think we have mentioned in the past prices for self expanding systems in Europe probably run a good 20% lower than what Edwards SAPIEN 3 price is and we're going to be not in that pact but we're going to be more like where we priced our other premium products SAPIEN 3.","Jason Mills","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. ","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you for taking the question and good evening. You added roughly 75 centers this year, implanting centers, little bit more than we had expected originally. How much or how many more do you have to go and what is the stocking pattern if any in the centers? ","Michael A. Mussallem","I'm sorry, we just heard a noise there, Joanne if you could\u2026","Joanne Wuensch","Didn\u2019t you hear any of my questions or just\u2026 ","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, I guess, we did hear it thanks very much Joanne. So, I think your estimate is right, it's probably around 75 centers that were added and it is probably a little bit more than we thought. This has turned out to be pretty organic. This isn\u2019t necessarily driven by Edwards these are hospital that I think in many cases already have surgical valve programs, they think about their future and they say boy if I'm going to be an asset to my community going forward I'm going to need to offer capital base system as well. And so there's a strong driving force for others to be able to move toward it. Stocking is pretty minimal, that's really not part of the equation here. So we do a fair amount of consignments. So I think this is really organic growth that you're seeing. ","Joanne Wuensch","That's very helpful. My second question as you talked about if I heard you correctly that you think your market share will remain flat in 2018 but I would love your view of what the competitive landscape is looking like and why do you think yours would stay flat?","Michael A. Mussallem","Well, I mean I don't know. We can see -- we can look back at what happened in 2017, there was probably I don't know in the U.S. we may have lost a point or two a share and that was at a time when our competitor had the approval of intermediate risk and introduce larger sizes. And we think for the most part that's done. And when we look at what's going on in Europe there aren\u2019t so many competitors anymore and those competitors that are there are probably having mid teens market share. So, when we look forward we say what is the share picture going to look like, we think probably it is close to we're going to grow about where is the market. Remember we have two new platforms that we're going to be introducing and that's probably some of the most novel products that will be introduced by anybody in 2018. So we think it's a reasonable estimate to say that share position stay pretty stable.","Joanne Wuensch","Sounds great. Thank you and have a good evening. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor of Barclay. Please proceed. ","Matthew Taylor","Hi, thanks and good evening. So, I wanted to ask a follow up question on some of your earlier mitral comments, you talked about Cardioband sales in the fourth quarter and seeing a little bit of a slower ramp in the first half and then jumping up in the second and so the question is, is that just moving further and how do we acquire that kind of a ramp to let's say PASCAL next year. Could you give a little bit more into the dynamics there?","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure, so probably on Cardioband at this stage it is probably less about the demand from customers and more about us. So, we are preferentially following units to our clinical trials which are very important from a long-term perspective. And then in terms of gee, why don't we just make more we're also in the process of migrating Cardioband to the Edwards quality system. We think this is -- it causes a little bit of short-term pain but it's for a lot of long term gain. We think it\u2019s a good move for us and so it is going to limit how many units we have available for commercial sales in fourth quarter and first quarter. But we think that we should clear that hurdle and get this product line moved into Edwards facilities in pretty short order and as we do that it will allow us to get on a more normal ramp. By comparison PASCAL was not an acquired product but a product line that was built within the Edwards system. So, we won't have those same kind of system migration issues and I would expect not to go through the same sort of process.","Matthew Taylor","Okay, thanks. Any meaningful data in the first half of the year at PCR in mitral and any of your pipeline programs that you are looking forward to? ","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, we don\u2019t think that there is going to be a lot of new information at ACC this year. There may be some minor things that are coming and PCR there could be more, it is a little early for us to project. But bigger picture I think there's going to be information that becomes available on our system routinely throughout the year. We've got a lot of big milestones in 2018 including related to Ultra and CENTERA and transcatheter heart valves, and then PASCAL and the tricuspid's Cardioband in the mitral system. And then even more in clinical care and surgical heart valve. So, I think there is going to be no shortage of news but I don't know how much news will there be at ACC or PCR. ","Matthew Taylor","Okay, thanks very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Please proceed. ","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. Mike, U.S. growth was particularly impressive this quarter and by my math the non-TAVR portion of the business really saw a big jump first in the first nine months of the year. We've seen something similar with some other companies this quarter too so, when you look at that is there anybody that thinks you may have underestimated the impact of some of the weather events in 3Q and that may have played a role in what we saw this quarter? ","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, I suppose that's possible. This is difficult for us to estimate. And again we don't call on 6000 hospitals in the U.S. We have a smaller universe in total so yeah, it's possible that we underestimated the impact of weather in the third quarter. But clearly we saw a robust fourth quarter across the board. So your observation is correct Chris but we probably were too focused of a company to be a good barometer for the entire market. ","Chris Pasquale","Okay, that's helpful and then circle back on the opportunity for CENTERA in Europe, so you touched on a lower pricing of some of the competitive systems there and my sense was that historically some centers may have gravitated to self expanding products in part because of that lower price point. So, first do you think that's accurate and then if so what portion of the roughly half of the market is self expanding today, do you think it is really open to you with a premium priced product?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, so thanks. You are on a great point Chris. To be honest with you we are not positive, exactly why that part of the market is buying what they are. Might it be on price, it could be their primary motivator, might it be they just happen to have a great relationship with the company that's serving them, that's possible and it might be that they learned on self expanding systems or have a preference for self expanding systems. And that's the bigger issue. So we're going to find that out but from Edwards they're not going to get self expanding at the same kind of low price. So we will figure that out pretty soon.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please proceed. ","Raj Denhoy","Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to ask on Pascal, I know you answered the question about kind of the pace of adoption but when you think about that market sort of already being so much established with mitral in Europe have you started to maybe give some thoughts around your expectation for what sort of share you could capture from that other product in 2019 and 2020? ","Michael A. Mussallem","No, you know that would really be getting ahead of ourselves. At this point we're really looking forward to having high quality clinical trials and trying to make sure that we have some outstanding outcomes. And once we get a chance to actually see a body of clinical data then we'll have a better understanding of what that ramp might look like. But it's just premature right now. ","Raj Denhoy","Okay, but I'm guessing your expectation it would be relatively high in terms of the share you would expect to take or hope to take with PASCAL? ","Michael A. Mussallem","Well I mean we're continuing to pursue the programs. We're not going to abandon it, we like the program a lot. We think that clinicians are going to like it a lot. The early feedback is good. But it's too soon for us to estimate what it will mean. ","Raj Denhoy","Fair enough and then maybe just on the surgical balance side on INTUITY, you had a very nice quarter and I guess the new technology add on payment is helping there and so I am just curious why you didn't raise the guidance for that segment as you look into 2019, I know it's relatively small given some other things you're doing but you did put up a very nice quarter and you had that nice tailwind on reimbursement so why not increase the guidance? ","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, so we're very excited about what's going on in surgical heart valves and the INTUITY growth is particularly exciting and I think as we mentioned we think this could become a quarter of our sales here in 2018. But you have to also understand what's going on there which is this is a big part of this business is aortic valve implantations and with the tremendous growth of TAVR there's a natural cannibalization that takes place. And so and you see our continued optimism in TAVR is a headwind for the surgical business and I think surgical business are very well prepared to deal with that and how really forward leaning have great innovations for surgeons. But that's one that causes us to be little bit moderate in terms of getting in front of ourselves. ","Raj Denhoy","Okay, but I guess one would expect given we won't see low risk for addition of the year or year and half or so, you should have another kind of nice season here of surgical valves I would think? ","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, we are pretty pleased with all of Edwards business. The critical care feels pretty good right now too but at this point we're not changing our estimates and it builds our confidence that we'll be able to put two to four up in surgical and six to eight in critical care. At the same time we're gravitating towards the high end of what we had previously estimated in transcatheter heart valves.","Raj Denhoy","Sounds great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. ","Glenn Novarro","Hi, good afternoon. Three real quick question for you Mike, first, in the U.S. how many TAVR centers you think will open up new centers in 2018, that's one? Two, the imaging study in the low risk SAPIEN trial, has that finished enrolling and will that also be at ACC? And then is there anything we should be paying attention to on the litigation front particularly seeing you in Boston Scientific -- versus SAPIEN and the sturdy shoes? Thank you. ","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure, so first on the number of centers, difficult for us to estimate. I don't know it might be in the 25 to 50 range in 2018, something similar to what we saw in 2017. Let's see what was your, I've forgotten your second question. ","Glenn Novarro","Yeah, the imaging study that\u2026","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, the imaging study is yet to enroll. So we are still engaged in enrolling that. That's something that we're very focused on. In terms of upcoming events we have U.S. IPR hearing on the validity of the Boston patents that were in December and we expect a decision in Q1. But just bigger picture, there is going to just be a number of court actions over an extended period of time. So I don't know that there's going to be anything decisive here in the near term.","Glenn Novarro","Okay, and then just the imaging study, does that finish enrolling in 1Q and do we see that in ACC as well next year?","Michael A. Mussallem","No, I think we were thinking of that more of a midyear kind of things and so, you may see something presented again with a subset of that study and I never know exactly if somebody might do a presentation that's an interim one. But more likely we think that it is going to be at least mid year for that to be fully enrolled. ","Glenn Novarro","Okay, so it is the main body that we see at ACC next year. ","Michael A. Mussallem","That's correct. ","Glenn Novarro","Okay, thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed. ","Bruce Nudell","Thanks for taking my question. Mike to fully exploit and cannibalize the surgical tissue of valve market it seems like you need longer study and kind of unencumbered ability to go after patients with bicuspid valves. Do you feel that the low risk label will be in anyway restrictive with regards to bicuspid valves, then I have a follow-up? ","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure, well I mean there's a couple of directions here. First as it relates to the surgical valve business, we think people with isolated aortic stenosis many of those are going to become great candidates for TAVR. But there are also a number of great surgical candidates, those that have complex conditions that are going to need surgery that address a number of issues including their aortic valve and they're also going to be the younger more active patients that are not going to be naturally great candidates for TAVR. So, we think both the combination of those and our innovations is going to keep the aortic side growing at the same time we're growing mitrals. As it relates to your question about bicuspid it's not contraindicated now. There's debate in the clinical community about it but we are running a bicuspid registry that matured further and formed that question.","Bruce Nudell","And then my second question pertains to M3 which was kind of released at the Analyst Day and could you just talk about your optimism about that approach, the strength of that approach, and any particular technical hurdles that that approach presents to you?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, so right now it's just early Bruce. And so we're involved in early feasibility and we're trying to evaluate that. From an optimism point of view I think we mentioned that we have quite a bit of experience with SAPIEN 3 in the mitral position and so that gives us some confidence that we can do a great job of anchoring and being leak free. It could be an interesting platform but it's just early and we're pleased to have two platforms. I mean we're optimistic about M3, we're also optimistic about the CardiAQ platform and making nice progress there and we are pleased with our cadence of implants and the results that we're getting. And again all the cases that Edwards is doing today we're doing transseptal so through percutaneous procedures.","Bruce Nudell","Thanks so much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Please proceed. ","Margaret Kaczor","Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two from me, first, I wanted to call up on the U.S. TAVR growth that you guys are seeing and you referenced some of the low volume centers seeing some nice growth and maybe that is due to referral networks. Any idea whether that is being driven by you guys through meeting some of the DTC marketing that you have done and maybe will you increase that or do you think its investments on behalf of the hospitals that understand the profitability of TAVR? ","Michael A. Mussallem","We think that the contribution that is coming from our direct to physician and direct to patient is still relatively small. And so we think that there is a real contribution that when centers add TAVR that they open up a referral network that hadn\u2019t been tapped into in the past and that's been a helpful driver. And so whether it\u2019s a brand new center or centers that are still relatively new only been at it for a few years that's where we are seeing some significant growth. ","Margaret Kaczor","And then two part guidance question, in terms of your guidance if you are looking out, how much do you assume for CENTERA and Ultra in 2018 and then when you reference staying more steady growth throughout the year given the momentum in Q4 were you referring global TAVR or were you referencing U.S. TAVR? Thanks. ","Michael A. Mussallem","So, in terms of CENTERA we really haven't penciled in very much. If we had success there, that could be a positive for us. It is relatively small in our guidance. In terms of where did we see the growth in the fourth quarter, it was everywhere. I mean of course the U.S. is our biggest region and so that stands out but we saw a strong momentum we think in all of our geographies. ","Scott B. Ullem","And just to add to that just carrying forward we think that's probably going to be the case in 2018 as well as you look out quarter-by-quarter and start to predict each quarter but the increased and less of the ramp is probably just because we're getting contributions around the world.","Margaret Kaczor","And I am sorry, just a follow up on that, when you look at 2018 and that steadier growth is that specifically to the U.S., global or both? Thanks. ","Michael A. Mussallem","That's what I am saying, I think it is going to be really broad based. It's tough to predict each geography but in the fourth quarter both of those regions grew over 20% and so we're expecting that we're going to get good growth from all of our major cities in 2018.","Margaret Kaczor","Great, thank you guys. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Please proceed. ","Joshua Jennings","Hi, thanks gentleman. I wanted to ask about the PARTNERS III continued access program and just to make sure that that's up and running and any details you can provide just in terms of number of patients per year, the restrictions per quarter per year if we think about a thousand patients we saw on the intermediate caps?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yeah, so this point focuses on completing the CT study. We don\u2019t have any kind of CAP program. Once we enroll at CT sub study we will evaluate the CAP program at that time and we will let you know if that's in the cards.","Joshua Jennings","Understood, thanks and just on the international performance, I mean clearly the European performance that you mentioned was aided by the comp in the absence in France last year but still if you exclude for that you still have at least high teens growth by our calculations. Are you seeing anything in Europe particularly in intermediate risk and attrition, are they moving down I guess the intermediate risk curve into that lower end of younger, less sick patients if you will with low risk --? Thanks for taking the question. ","Michael A. Mussallem","No, I think generally not. You have to remember that Europe is this combination of many countries, some of the countries that just didn\u2019t have reimbursement in place in the early days are starting to have it in place. So, that may help but just broadly if those places that were less penetrated so the smaller countries if you will they are probably making the bigger contribution to growth in Europe.","Joshua Jennings","Thanks a lot. ","Michael A. Mussallem","Okay, well thanks so much for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, David and I will welcome any additional questions by telephone and with that back to you David.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, David Erickson, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please begin.","David K. Erickson - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our first quarter 2017 financial results. During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Scott Ullem, CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to financial guidance and current expectations for new product approvals, clinical and regulatory milestones, reimbursement and competitive matters, as well as trends in therapy adoption and foreign currency movements. These statements speak only as of the date in which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today.","Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in our press release, our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, all of which are available on our website at edwards.com.","Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying and adjusted, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release and on our website.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thank you, David. We're pleased to report strong first quarter results, which continued the trend of exceptional growth for Edwards at both the top and bottom lines. In the quarter, we are also pleased with our progress on key R&D milestones as we pursue innovative solutions for the patients we serve.","Robust demand for TAVR therapy resulted in strong total sales growth of 19% on an underlying basis. It also excludes a net estimated $62 million of Germany stocking sales. Customers in Germany elected to purchase additional inventory of SAPIEN 3 in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation in that country.","Independent of the Germany stocking sales, we delivered results above our expectations which reflected strength in all three of our product lines across all regions. In transcatheter heart valves, adjusted global sales, excluding the Germany stocking sales, were $477 million, up 32% on an underlying basis over the prior year.","Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption across all geographies. Globally, our average selling prices remained stable. In the U.S., Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy sales for the quarter were $299 million, representing 39% growth on an underlying basis versus the prior year.","Therapy adoption this quarter was strong with continued increases in procedures across more than 500 hospitals. This trend continues to be driven by the extraordinary performance of SAPIEN 3 and the growing body of evidence that supports excellent patient outcomes and faster recovery.","Growth was broadly distributed across established high implanting centers as well as more recently added hospitals. We believe overall U.S. procedure growth this quarter was consistent with our growth. Outside the U.S. excluding the impact of the Germany stocking sales, the underlying growth rate was 21%. We continue to be encouraged by the strong international adoption of TAVR, particularly where overall therapy penetration is still very low.","In Europe, Edwards' underlying unit growth in the first quarter was in line with the overall procedure growth which we estimate was in the mid-teens compared to last year. Consistent with previous quarters, growth in European countries with lower TAVR adoption rates continued to outpace countries where the therapy is more established.","In the quarter, our business in France recovered faster than expected following our reduced shipments late last year. We estimate that newer competitors continue to represent approximately mid-teens percentage of total procedures in Europe. We believe our results reflected little benefit from a competitor's product recall during the quarter and that others are likely to be the primary beneficiaries.","In the UK, we're very pleased to see that the reimbursement authority, NICE, proposed draft treatment guidelines recommending TAVR for a broader group of patients. These recommendations are expected to be considered and finalized later this year. Following the introduction of SAPIEN 3 in Japan, we continued to see strong TAVR therapy adoption with more than 100 sites now performing procedures and new centers being qualified. We believe that most of the treatment in Japan today is centered on patients at high surgical risk.","Turning to our near term product pipeline, we continue to expect our new ultra system including an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology will be available in Europe in the second half of 2017. Clinical trial results on our CENTERA system will be presented at EuroPCR next month and we expect to launch later this year.","After a slow start last year, enrollment is increasing in our PARTNER III low-risk trial and our goal is to have this randomized trial fully enrolled around year-end. We're currently engaged in the contracting process on our EARLY-TAVR trial and the first patients are being screened. This groundbreaking trial is the first of its kind to study severe aortic stenosis patients without diagnosed symptoms, and therefore it's difficult to estimate enrollment timing.","Turning to patent litigation. In the quarter, the German courts ruled that both Edwards and Boston Scientific infringed each other's patents, and each company has the ability to assert an injunction although neither has done so. As a reminder, they initiated litigation that now involves multiple patents in multiple countries, which is likely to yield numerous court actions over an extended period of time. Our guidance anticipates no disruption to the supply of SAPEIN 3 valves to patients.","In summary, as a result of the strong start to 2017, we now expect full year THV sales to be at the high end of our previously estimated 15% to 20% underlying growth rate. This full year guidance excludes the impact of the Germany stocking sales.","Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, sales for the first quarter of $200 million was up about 3% on an underlying basis compared to last year. This was driven by strong demand of our EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and the supply recovery in mitral valve sales partially offset by the continuing shift from our surgical aortic values to SAPIEN 3. Globally, our average selling price was flat. We're really very pleased with the stronger-than-expected adoption in the quarter of our INTUITY value system in the U.S. This higher value offering is offsetting the TAVR impact on our surgical valve portfolio.","We remain disciplined in our pricing strategy and are optimistic about this innovative platform and its ability to help even more patients. A recent study published in the Journal of Comparative Effectiveness Research compared the economic outcomes of INTUITY Elite valve system versus conventional full sternotomy aortic valve replacements. They found that INTUITY procedures had a lower overall length of stay, cross-clamp time and OR time which resulted in a lower cost. The analysis also showed lower instances of 30-day mortality, stroke and re-operation all of which are very encouraging signs.","In our surgical micro valves, sales growth was enhanced by the now largely completed recovery from the supply interruption we experienced in mid-2016 and we remain on track to begin launching our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve in Europe and Japan later this year. In summary, as a result of the strong first-quarter results in surgical heart valves, we now expect sales to be at the high end of our previously estimated underlying sales growth rate of 1% to 3%.","In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $145 million and grew at nearly a 9% underlying growth rate. Strong performance was driven by double-digit growth in our Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, growth across all product categories and a first quarter lift from an approximate $5 million U.S. bulk order.","Our next-generation advanced monitoring platform, HemoSphere, just recently received U.S. regulatory clearance. A global commercial rollout of this platform will be commencing in the second half of the year. This all-in-one system will provide greater clarity on a patient's hemodynamic status to enable clinicians to make timely, potentially lifesaving decisions. HemoSphere is modular in design and we plan to add Enhanced Surgical Recovery capabilities in the future.","And later this year, we plan to begin launching our Acumen HPI software suite with our new FloTrac IQ Smart Disposable. This is a low blood pressure or hypotension probability indicator to warn physicians in advance of this dangerous condition. We plan a full launch in the U.S. and Europe in 2018. In summary, as a result of our strong first-quarter results in Critical Care, we now expect full-year sales to be at the high end of our previously estimated underlying sales growth rate of 5% to 7%.","We continue to be encouraged by the opportunity to treat mitral and tricuspid patients with transcatheter therapies that have seen good momentum toward key strategic milestones during the first quarter. During the quarter, we acquired Valtech. And while it had minimal sales impact, we're pleased with the physician interest in our Cardioband transcatheter mitral valve repair device and believe that transcatheter repair of the annulus will be an important option for many patients. We are actively engaged in the integration, including building our European field team, simplifying the patient selection protocol and scaling up manufacturing. We are also engaging in product enhancements to improve procedure time and simplicity. And we remain on track in the CE Mark clinical trial using this technology to treat tricuspid patients.","Additionally, we're pleased with the early progress being made treating patients with our FORMA tricuspid therapy. While our experience is early, we continue to receive significant interest from patients in solutions for isolated tricuspid regurgitation. We expect updates on these programs to be discussed at EuroPCR next month.","We're receiving significant positive feedback from clinicians on our PASCAL transcatheter system, a therapy we believe is suitable for a large underserved group of patients only partially addressed by transcatheter mitral repair therapy today. We continue to anticipate CE Mark enrollment to commence this year and expect an update on the early clinical outcomes in compassionate cases to be presented at EuroPCR next month.","As you know, we paused clinical enrollment in our trials with the Edwards CardiAQ valve for additional testing, which we completed during the first quarter and have resumed patient screening. In parallel, we completed an in-depth analysis of the patients treated to-date in the program, including a review of patient selection, risk profile and outcomes. Working closely with our clinician partners, we have incorporated those learnings into our patient selection process and future product enhancements. Based on our current plans, we now expect a CE mark and commercial availability of a more refined system in 2019. We continue to believe CardiAQ with transseptal delivery is a very promising therapy for resolving patients' mitral regurgitation.","In summary, we've seen greater momentum across our emerging portfolio of mitral and tricuspid repair therapies and are very focused on the clinical development of each program. During the quarter, we gained valuable experience through treating more than 50 patients with our repair therapies. Based on our current progress and expected timelines, we believe that our transcatheter repair therapies offer the potential to address patient needs and generate sales earlier than transcatheter replacement therapy.","Overall, while still early, we believe our aggressive investments in research and development are well placed and offer the potential to help more patients and drive future growth.","And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thanks, Mike. We got off to a strong start for the year with sales of $884 million, or $822 million excluding $62 million of net Germany stocking sales. This represents an underlying growth rate of 19%. Our underlying sales and growth rates will continue to exclude this impact.","Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter, which also excluded the impact of Germany stocking, was $0.94, which reflects 32% growth over the last year period. GAAP earnings per share was $1.06. This earnings growth benefited from broad based strong performance in each of our product lines and regions.","I'll now cover the details behind our results, including guidance for the remainder of the year. For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 75.6% compared to 74.1% in the same period last year. This increase was driven primarily by a more profitable product mix led by growing sales of transcatheter valves, partially offset by the impact from foreign exchange.","Germany stocking sales also provided a modest benefit to our gross profit margin. We continue to expect our full year gross profit rate excluding special items to be between 74% and 76%. First quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8% over the prior year to $230 million or 26% of sales. The increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expenses relating to transcatheter valves. The ratio of SG&A as a percentage of sales would have been about 200 basis points higher consistent with our guidance if you excluded the benefit of Germany stocking sales.","We continue to expect full year SG&A excluding special items to be between 28% and 29% of sales. Research and development investments in the quarter increased 26% over the prior year period to $129 million or 14.6% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter aortic and mitral valve programs including the recent acquisition of Valtech and several small purchases of transcatheter valve intellectual property that were expensed as in-process research and development.","As with the selling, general and administrative expense ratio, the research and development ratio would've been approximately 100 basis points higher without the Germany stocking sales. We continue to expect our R&D investments, excluding special items, to be between 16% and 17% of sales for the full-year. During the first quarter, we recorded $10 million in intellectual property litigation-related expenses, which have been excluded from adjusted earnings per share consistent with our convention. These expenses related primarily to intellectual property litigation in the U.S. and Europe.","Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 21.6%, a small decline from 22% in the prior-year period. This quarter's rate benefited over 300 basis points consistent with our forecast from the new accounting for employee stock-based compensation partially offset by increases associated with country income mix. This accounting benefit will fluctuate in each reporting period making period comparisons less consistent. We now expect our full-year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 22% and 23%.","Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted first quarter sales by $6 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now estimate an approximate $50 million negative impact to full-year 2017 sales compared to the prior year. This is less than the impact we estimated at our December investor conference, so at current rates our sales from outside the U.S. would make a bigger contribution than we forecasted back in December.","Compared to our February guidance, foreign exchange rates had less than a $0.01 impact on earnings per share in the first quarter. Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $112 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $128 million, less capital spending of $16 million. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.6 million shares for $437 million to help offset dilution associated with our Valtech acquisition and stock-based incentive compensation. Average shares outstanding during the quarter declined to 216 million. We have over $500 million for share repurchase available our current authorization and we continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for the year of $216 million to $218 million.","At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $918 million, a reduction from last quarter reflecting our acquisition of Valtech and other repurchases. Total debt was about $850 million.","Turning to our 2017 guidance. Given our strong start to the year, we are narrowing our full-year sales guidance to $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion from $3.0 billion to $3.4 billion. This $100 million midpoint raise includes an improvement from foreign exchange. This guidance excludes the impact of Germany stocking sales.","Our sales guidance for each product line remains unchanged, albeit we now expect sales to be higher in the guidance ranges we provided at our conference. Our range for Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy is $1.7 billion to $2 billion; for Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, $750 million to $790 million; and for critical care, $560 million to $600 million. With a strong first quarter behind us, we now expect our full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be between $3.43 and $3.55.","For the second quarter 2017, at current foreign exchange rates we project underlying sales to be between $810 million and $850 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.82 and $0.92 excluding the impact of Germany stocking sales. And finally for full year 2017, we continue to expect free cash flow excluding special items to be in the range of $575 million to $650 million.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thanks, Scott. In conclusion, our strong start to 2017 bolsters our confidence in our focused innovation strategy. We believe there are abundant opportunities within our areas of focus to provide meaningful innovations for patients and drive significant organic growth. Our foundation of leadership, coupled with our robust product pipeline, positions us well for continued long-term success and greater shareholder value.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David K. Erickson - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thank you, Mike. In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and we'll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the hour.","Operator, we're ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. And thank you, our first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on a strong quarter. Mike, let me start with the intermediate risk ramp in the U.S. and then I have one follow up on CENTERA. So Q1 is the second full quarter for the intermediate risk approval. Can you talk about how the roll out is going relative to your expectations? And I know ACC was just last month, but have you noticed any early impact from that SURTAVI data? Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. It's \u2013 as you know, when you start talking about risk profiles it's always difficult to characterize. Overall, we're very pleased with the quarter. It was a little better than our expectations, several things broke our way. I do think there was a positive impact of the SURTAVI trial. Whenever we see these continued positive outcomes in a robust clinical study like that, I think it does help the overall awareness and therapy adoptions. But for us, we have some positive things break for us in several smaller areas across the quarter.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's helpful. And then, I wanted to ask about CENTERA since we're going to see the CE Mark data at PCR next month. Mike, big picture, how are you thinking about CENTERA? And you've talked about the data during \u2013 the last few months, you talked positively about what your expectations are for the clinical data, but I think investors want to see you commit to bringing that product to the U.S. to give them confidence that you're confident in the long-term outlook for that product. So could you give us a little bit more color on how you are thinking about CENTERA? Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. As I indicated, we continue to expect the CE Mark and to launch this later this year, so that tells you a little bit about how we feel about it. We're looking forward to having that data presented at EuroPCR, and that'll be 30-day data across the European experience. And what we've seen so far, we're excited about it. We think it has a chance of being a best-in-class, self-expanding TAVR platform. Now having said that, we haven't yet made a decision about the U.S. SAPIEN 3 has been so successful that we really have focused our efforts on indication expansion with the existing device and think that that's more valuable than bringing a second platform right now. But we'll keep you tuned in as this develops.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Mike, let me just follow-up quickly on CENTERA, Larry's question. The data is going to be at PCR that you said will launch later this year, is the launch at PCR or are we really talking sometime later in the year to get any benefit?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","No, we're really talking later in the year and I think most likely fourth quarter.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And what's the gating factor there, manufacturing rent?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","No, the CE Mark itself. We're going to use this data to feed the CE Mark and there's just a lot to do in that regard.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, got it. As you're aware, Mike, there's been a lot of angst in the last couple of quarters about the ups and downs in the U.S. TAVR market, and every time we kind of remind people that this isn't a straight line. Can you just talk a little bit about what you saw this quarter that might have been incrementally different if at all from the prior two quarters? And then talk about the pace at which you continue to introduce TAVR to some of those centers that are further down the curve that don't have it. You highlighted again today that you're over 500 centers now in the U.S. Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So let's just start from the top. This has been difficult for us to estimate and especially with a high degree of precision. I'll just remind you, if a valve is approximately $30,000 and there's 500 hospitals, if each hospital had one more or one less procedure per quarter, that's a $15 million swing. So I told you about the difficulty in nailing this and so here we are with 500 centers in the U.S.","So what broke our way were several small things. Foreign exchange helped us, probably it was more than $3 million, we probably had a little faster recovery in France than we anticipated. As you indicated, the new hospitals in the U.S. actually ramped up a little faster than we thought. We saw this broad base and we used to see almost all of the growth come from the big centers, but the new centers are clearly adding value. That's going to probably increase slowly over time. And then, we probably didn't see the competitive impact yet. We probably will expect to see it later in the year, but we just didn't feel it in the quarter the way we expected to.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, Mike. I just have one last question. There's been a real interesting change in kind of the long-term dynamic of the TAVR market over the last few months. Your direct flow went out of business, Symetis is getting acquired by Boston. And so you really have, I think in the beginning, what looks like to be a little bit more concentrated market, particularly as we look out in Europe over the next several years. Have your thoughts on what it plays out with pricing over the next few years in Europe changed at all?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","You know, we've always believed that this was more of a heart valve market than a stent market. I know people like to draw the analogy to coronary stents. We saw our pricing in heart valves stay pretty stable, and we think this is likely \u2013 although it's highly competitive, this is a big burden on a company to be excellent in Transcatheter Heart Valves and we're going to do everything we can that continue to advance the state-of-the-art such that it's not easy for new players or small players to engage. So now it's price playing out pretty close to what we thought, we expect it to be more competitive over time, but it's not unexpected.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please, proceed.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the question and congrats on a great start to the year. First, just a quick one for Scott. On the earnings guidance for the year, the increase that you guys talked about, I just want to confirm that excludes Germany. And can you just talk about besides the increase and a more conviction on revenue growth, were there any other drivers of the uptick in EPS besides just strong revenue growth?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","So to your first question, Bob, yes, it excludes any impact from stocking activity in Germany. And in terms of EPS, it really largely reflects the strong start to the first quarter. And so that's most of the driver to increasing the range of earnings guidance for the year.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Yeah, I just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else in there that we should be aware of. And then for Mike, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about U.S. TAVR, both from the perspective of this quarter, were there any kind of common themes driving these strong results on, say, better awareness on intermediate risk? So maybe just a little bit more color on the U.S. TAVR number this particular quarter. And then on the pipeline for U.S. TAVR, I realize \u2013 I heard your comments on CENTERA, do you plan on bringing Ultra to the U.S.? And if you don't want to talk about that, maybe just when you're going to provide a little more color on the U.S. pipeline? Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. So overall, the U.S. \u2013 we didn't really get surprised by any of the trends that we see. We're not sure that there was much difference. The year-over-year share growth \u2013 or market growth or procedure growth continued to be strong. We thought it was similar to our own growth levels so that tells you you've just got a fast-growing market. Whether that was stimulated by the SURTAVI results, I don't know, but it's continued to be strong. We look at things sequentially. We sometimes look at procedures per day, and that's had a continued march north and continually improve. But really, nothing unusual. Pricing very stable, clinical sales were not unusual, and I'm not sure the share position's really changed very much as well.","In terms of the pipeline in the U.S., yes, we would intend to bring Ultra to the U.S. We probably intend to bring that in 2018. We haven't laid out any specifics, but you should expect that.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, for taking the question and I echo everyone else, congrats on a great start to the year. Sticking first with U.S. TAVR, and then I want to follow up on mitral, Mike, if I could. You mentioned that enrollment in the low-risk trial is accelerating, you expect to have it fully enrolled by the end of the year. Could you talk about the contribution from enrollment in that trial in the first quarter feeding into the clinical sales that you did? And also perhaps talk about \u2013 however you look at penetration of the market, whether it be relative to the number of hospitals you're in or relative to the indications that you currently are on label for getting reimbursed for, sort of juxtaposed to the number of procedures you think the market is doing, just where you are \u2013 and I know with low-risk it expands it quite a little bit, but where you are today would be helpful.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So as I mentioned, we got a slow start last year on enrolling that low-risk trial PARTNER III. We didn't have \u2013 although we picked up and then the ramp has picked up, it was still less than $5 million in the quarter. And not really much different than a year previous, so it wasn't really a contributor to our growth, if you will. We said that we're hopeful that we'll get this enrolled by year-end. So we \u2013 it counts on the fact that we're going to continue to get a pick-up in those rates, but this is a big trial and we're continuing to track it.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. And then anything on the penetration side of the question, just the total market opportunity?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. You know our feelings about this. We said that there \u2013 in our view in the U.S., there are 650,000 patients with severe aortic stenosis and symptoms. and that our treatment rate is under 20%, so we think we have a very long way to go. We're just at the front end of this. And there's lot of obstacles, a lot of issues for us to overcome and that's our challenge, but that's also our opportunity to drive growth over a long term.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Understood. On the mitral side, Mike, you gave us some good detail about your pipeline and the product portfolio, and what you expect in terms of clinical outcomes? Has anything changed in your mind with respect to contribution to the revenue model this year from your mitral portfolio? And then you mentioned CardioAQ launch here, hoping for a CE Mark now in 2019 with a refined device. Is that a transseptal delivery? Just a clarification there would be helpful.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Jason. We're going to need to let other people have a chance here, too.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Sure.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","So first of all in terms of this year, we've only owned this \u2013 this is our first quarter owning it and it's too soon for us to update any estimates about what the contribution of Cardioband would be in 2017. More broadly, we've got a lot of progress that we feel good about. But probably not a lot of sales contribution in 2017 and 2018 from the overall portfolio.","In terms of CardiAQ, yes, our intention and we believe that a transseptal device will be important for these patients, and that's what we're putting all of our energy into. Of course, we may have a transapical delivery system as well, but we think that ideally for these patients to be treated it would be transseptal. And that's what I was referring to when I said that we would hope to have a CE Mark and a launch in 2019.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks. I'll get back in line. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please proceed.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Mike, I also had a couple of questions on the transcatheter mitral program. First, can you talk a little more about what you learned during your analysis of the CardiAQ data and what changes you think need to made to that product?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah, sure. So first of all, there is just a lot of learning. We think it's a really promising therapy. This kind of pause probably shouldn't be unexpected at this early stage. The fact of the matter is, it's a really large valve system, it's in a high-pressure environment and these patients generally have very sick ventricles. So as we gain experience, we've really thought about, we'd need to probably bring a more refined valve system that's likely to have the potential to have an improved safety profile when we bring it. And so there's been a lot of thought about refining the patient selection criteria as well. So we're really trying to bring an improved system when we bring it.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then second, I thought your comments on repair versus replacement were interesting and really highlight the advantage of the diversified approach you guys have taken to that market. I know you have a foot in both camps. Can you just elaborate on what's driving your thinking that repair solutions may be ready for primetime first? And you guys actually have a number of different devices, anything right now that you see as a front runner in terms of early contribution?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Right now I'm not sure that I would call out a frontrunner. We'll have more clarity on that as time goes on, but we've been pleased with the current progress. We're hitting our timelines, we're having favorable conversations with regulators and feel like there's momentum. I mentioned that we had more than 50 patients with our repair therapies that we had experienced with this quarter. It appears to us that even though they may not be perfectly efficacious that the safety profile associated with these repair technologies is quite good, and that's an encouraging factor and probably the reason that they're likely to have an earlier impact than the replacement technologies.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, just a quick clarification and one question for me. On Cardioband, it was kind of an immaterial revenue driver frankly to 2017, but you're still comfortable at the $15 million to $20 million or $10 million to $15, the guidance that you've provided in December, does that number still stand or are we incrementally less comfortable with that number?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","No, it still stands. It really was almost a negligible contribution in the first quarter, but it's too soon for us to really offer up a view on how good to feel about the $10 million to $15 million. We'll let you know here when we get one more quarter under our belt.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very clear. And then Mike, just you were asked some questions on pricing in the TAVR competitive environment. If we just take the ex-U.S. market for a second and move away from price and think about share, obviously Boston is both \u2013 has had some difficulties with the LOTUS Valve System they've acquired from Symetis valve systems. The net effect you think of those moves in the 2017, 2018 timeframe, how do you think that changes the European share landscape in either certain specific countries like Germany over the balance of the year? Does it get sort of net out (39:26) pretty even or is a potential share opportunity for Edwards or potential opportunity for share degradation?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah, thanks. What we modeled at the start of the year is that we would probably grow in Europe at a slower rate than the market so we thought that we would cede some market share. There wasn't to one particular valve system, just broadly to an aggressive set of competitors. We know there is a big difference between competitor's pricing and our pricing, often it can be more than 20% for that matter. So although consolidation might be helpful in the long term, in the near term it's not very clear. One of the things that I wanted to \u2013 that we mentioned on our prepared remarks is that we didn't feel like we benefited from the exit of Boston. And a matter of fact, it's more likely that others would be a beneficiary of it. And I think in particular, we think that when we speculate on this that the customers there could often be price sensitive and that they might more likely have something that fit inside their budget that comes from one of our competitors.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So just talking about pretty neutral share implications for you based on these recent moves for Europe relative to your prior expectations.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","I think it's fair. We still have models that we could have some mild decline, that's what's in our guidance.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Please proceed.","Matthew Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. I'll ask two quick ones if I could, try to help you get through the list. So the first just on the trends in the U.S., you're entering the second quarter. I know you don't give second quarter guidance by geography, but given the difficulty and setting expectations before we get ahead of ourselves hereof, it was a very strong and impressive Q1. I just wanted to get a sense, if you could maybe tick off a few things that we might consider as you put together U.S. numbers, ups and downs, things that might impact the second quarter? And then I have one follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Well, I mean, we're pleased with the momentum coming out of Q1. I think in general we've seen a modest increase each quarter in sort of the procedures per day or the procedures per billing day so we expect that to incline, to increase. We know that Easter occurs in the second quarter, didn't occur in the first quarter. So that could be a factor that affects second quarter. But other than that, I really can't put my finger on anything unusual.","Matthew Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Share loss maybe? I mean, you said you didn't see in the first quarter share impact from competitive U.S. products.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. No, I think, that's right. That's a good point, Matt. The same thing that we sort of said about Europe, we also assumed about the U.S., is that we would have sales growth. That's probably slightly below the procedure growth across the overall market, and so we thought we would lose some share in the U.S. and that didn't happened much in the first quarter. That's probably more likely to happen in the rest of the year.","Matthew Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Then just one on product that we hear a lot of good things about from clinicians, or at least a lot of anticipation around the Ultra delivery system. You talked about bringing that to Europe. Can you talk at all about your plans potentially for the U.S.?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. You know what, we weren't really prepared to discuss that on this call. I think in general it's very likely that we're going to launch it in 2018, but I can't give you more specifics than that, Matt.","Matthew Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","That's great. Thank you for the color.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Wonder if I could just may be ask you about your comments around the U.S. marketing, your expectation for you to continue to grow along with the market. And I'm curious because we saw the core valve data a month or so ago, and while they did meet their endpoint of non-inferiority, they still shared a relatively high pacemaker rate and one could argue that the SAPIEN 3 data is still sort of best-in-class out there. And so with that as a context, I guess I'm curious why you wouldn't be perhaps more supportive of the idea that you might be able to take share or at least continue to hold a very strong position in this market going forward?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Well, you could imagine we're competitive and we believe in SAPIEN 3 and we believe that it's the best product out there and so that's we represent every day. We're also trying to be realistic. We have a very strong share position and we wouldn't be surprised as, for example, as Medtronic launches these larger sizes for them to have some impact.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Okay, that's fair. And maybe just one clarification on the stocking in Germany, you mentioned you're excluding it from revenue but as we go forward in the next couple of quarters, do you anticipate we'll still see additional stocking revenue in the second quarter? And then as we move to the year, will those stocking sales sort of get consumed in the marketplace? And how do we really \u2013 how should we expect you to be reporting these numbers?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah, thanks. It's going to be a challenge. So the response was varied across the customer base. There's about 80 TAVR centers in Germany and some bought more than others. Our guess is that most of the increase or all of the increase probably already occurred and that there's more likely to be some kind of net decline or net usage as time goes forward.","And you saw that Scott's comments that what we're modeling here, that's likely or it's reasonable to assume that it's washed out by the end of the year, but it's very difficult for us to estimate how that's going to flow. What you're going to see from us though is a report of underlying growth that takes that out. And so we're going to try and eliminate the impact of those stocking orders so that you can see more or less what same-store sales looks like.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","It sounds like it's going to be fun. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, just a quick question on the U.S. market and then one for Scott. Just looking at the cadence of product sales ex-royalties for the market last year, first quarter was 308 (46:08), last quarter was something like 377 (46:10). Should we be thinking about just the law of large numbers in the U.S. where the first quarter was relatively easy compared, progressively got harder over the year or so, thinking about what sort of growth rate. The first quarter is 40% procedure growth in the U.S., should we be thinking about 30% across the year? And is the growth still as it was namely recruitment of people who just really wanted treated before, or rather is cannibalization of surgery becoming a very big part of the growth?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","So yeah, there are several questions buried in there. So overall, we expect there to be an increase in the usage. So in other words, if we were to reduce it to how many cases are done per day, we think it would go up quarter-after-quarter throughout the year. Now as you correctly noted, last year this extraordinary growth rate that we enjoyed, the comparisons are going to get much tougher. So the actual growth rate that we reported in the U.S. for the out quarters is going to come down significantly from where it is. But that's all in our guidance. We feel very comfortable that we're going to have a strong year, that it's a growing market and that's very consistent with our long-term expectations.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","I'll just add to that, Bruce, it's Scott, that longer-term we expect this global market to be $5-plus billion. And if you just do the compounded math on that, it gets you to a mid-teens underlying growth rate over time. The sequential growth rate quarter-to-quarter may jump around a fair bit as we've seen historically based upon seasonality and other factors just relating to therapy adoption.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And so, Scott, my final question is just, they were stocking this quarter you excluded. And as you work off that stocking, are you going to adjust the reported number upward to account for kind of the destocking of the original stocking?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So we'll show every quarter what the adjusted sales are, which looks through the stocking and the destocking. We'll also obviously show the GAAP results. And the way we're calculating this is really going center-by-center, tabulating with the help of our field sales personnel what the order trends are and making some assumptions and decisions around inventory turns and how much of this consumption is related to new orders and how much of it is related to destocking. But we're going to break out both numbers and be very transparent about how we arrived at the tallies.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, despite LOTUS coming, being posed to the market in Europe, you saw it really wouldn't impact your business and you would still grow slightly below European market rates, but I believe you're still launching CENTERA and that we're going to see that data next month at PCR. So maybe talk about your plans for CENTERA. And I thought that that would be a product that you can launch into a Boston or Medtronic account and be able to take some shares. So maybe can you help us think about how CENTERA, the strategy behind the launch and what that could do to your European share over time? Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for that, Glenn. As I try to indicate, it's probably a Q4 launch and frankly in our guidance there's not a lot of impact from CENTERA. It's going to be \u2013 it'll be newly launched in 2017 even though we're optimistic about it. We're going to be very thoughtful about that. We're still working out, what we're going to price CENTERA at, and that probably will be an important factor and sort of nailing down our launch plan. So I don't have a lot of specifics but I can say that we don't have a big bump in the numbers for CENTERA as we stand today.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. But as we think about going into 2018, does the share, which you're now assuming you'll lose, can share actually pick up a bit from a modeling point of view for 2018 with this valve in the marketplace for you?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","I think we're going to be in better position to address questions like that after we see the data from EuroPCR.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. I'll see you in Paris next month. Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good evening and thank you for taking the question. When the third quarter was reported, everyone expected a much stronger U.S. number, they were disappointed. Fourth quarter, also somewhat disappointed. And now the first quarter is, yay. How do we think about what may have made the first quarter a yay, and how much of this continues, or should we just sort of be trying to think about quarterly variations and not to get too caught up in any particular quarterly number?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","I hate to say this but I think it's more of the latter, Joanne, that we didn't think that the third quarter was so bad or the fourth quarter was so bad, they're actually pretty impressive growth rates. We were very pleased with what was going on in the U.S. and we continue to be pleased in the first quarter. Again, on the margin, a few little things that might have helped in the first quarter, but overall, very much within what you would expect as a natural variability. I shared that statistic about just one valve a quarter in each center can swing it $15 million in terms of our results.","So sometimes I think we can be prone to sort of trying to explain trends too much when some of it can be just specific to some \u2013 to a given quarter or even a given month. So I think we need to be a little cautious on trying to read too much into any given quarter. We try and look at the long-term trends and we're obviously in this for the long run.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then leveraging from that, the gross margin obviously benefited from the higher TAVR sales. Can we pull apart that margin number to think about each of the individual components to help us in modeling going forward? Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. I mean, we feel good about the gross margin. And as we indicated, one of the things that lift it is the growing TAVR sales. Because TAVR grows faster than the rest of the portfolio, that should have a favorable impact. Now having said that, we're going to be launching hopefully some transcatheter mitral products over time, and those aren't necessarily going to be very attractive from a cost perspective early on. So it's tough to read too much into it long-term. Overall, I think it's a favorable story but it's tough to be precise about.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. Congratulations on the nice quarter here. Maybe one \u2013 first one for Mike, and I have one follow-up on the guidance. Mike, I think you made some comments on the UK NICE recommendations, right? Is it possible we could have the UK market actually expanding and if some of these changes actually happen?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. A matter of fact, when we refer to countries that are growing at a faster growth rate, the UK is one of those that's growing faster than the rest of Europe. Now again, their penetration rate in terms of treatment historically has been lower than other countries, but it's really started to pick up some momentum. So yeah, we are seeing that.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Great. And then just maybe one quick one on the guidance. I just want to make sure, for the guidance increase, that does not assume any benefit from the Boston LOTUS recall, right? And then I think you mentioned something about FX improving, just could you quantify how much was the FX benefit? Thank you.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","So yeah, it assumes nothing relating to Boston. In terms of the FX benefit, we had a little bit of a tailwind in Q1 and we're expecting that just round numbers, instead of an $80 million headwind to sales that we expected over 2017 back at our investor conference, we're now thinking it may be in the neighborhood of $50 million.","Obviously, the currency markets have been moving around a lot. Euro has strengthened, yen has weakened so we'll update that number as time goes on. But it would probably be less of a headwind in terms of sales than we originally anticipated. For earnings per share, no real impact because we've got this foreign exchange hedging program in place that insulates our EPS, at least for the course of 2017.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Please proceed.","Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on the quarter. So Mike, specifically, you all mentioned the 500 centers in the U.S. Mike, the rough math that I have done indicates sequentially procedures per day in the U.S. and in Europe took a step up. When you look at \u2013 I guess, can you give us some idea, Mike, how you're all looking at new center adds as the year progresses, any contribution? I know you all mentioned in the past stocking per center. And the reason I ask is, if I exclude the stocking also from Germany, even OUS, procedures per day jumped up pretty nicely, any color would be great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. This is something we watch on a long-term basis and we feel like procedures per day has been routinely increasing throughout the course of the past several years. Just to talk a little bit more specifically about U.S. TAVR centers, we mentioned there's more than 500. We probably added more than 10 in Q1. We expect that number of centers to slowly increase. As a matter of fact, we've been kind of surprised that there's been an addition of these newly qualifying centers. So there is obviously a driving force and they've come up pretty fast and started to contribute to procedure growth. So it's been meaningful.","Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Gillings with JMP Securities. Please proceed.","John T. Gillings - JMP Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","John T. Gillings - JMP Securities LLC","Just wanted to hit quickly on early TAVR. I know it's a little further out, but you mentioned you are starting to screen some patients there. I'm wondering if you can give us just some color on how difficult it is to find patients for this.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","We still have to learn about that. As I mentioned, this is a groundbreaking trial, really first of its kind. And even though we're studying severe aortic stenosis patients, these are patients without diagnosed symptoms so it's really tough for us to estimate what enrollment is going to be like. We know that some centers already have patients that they've identified, but it's not clear how prevalent that is and how it's going to go.","So we're going to learn a lot. We're also going to learn something, that when somebody gets enrolled in the trial, do they drop out? Once they go on the treadmill do they actually demonstrate symptoms which would make them TAVR candidates, but they would step out of the trial, and all that. So it's going to be a steep learning curve for us and we find it difficult to predict.","John T. Gillings - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned the potential for people to step out whether it's being put into PARTNER III or something else, and you mentioned it's very early days. But are you getting any buzz from the sales force? Is this something that doctors are thinking about? Are they starting to say hey, you know what, maybe we should put more people on the treadmill. Just any comments there would be great.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. I think it's still too new. I wouldn't say that we got any benefit, for example, in Q1. So the screening is just now taking place. The key unknown is that treadmill is in the guidance but we know that there's many physicians that are cautious about putting a patient on a treadmill. So again, we're going to learn a lot about the practice of medicine and at this point, we just don't have much insight. But again, if the question was really, did we already get the benefit from that, the answer is no.","John T. Gillings - JMP Securities LLC","Yeah, makes sense. Thanks a lot guys and congrats on the quarter.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Please proceed.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. I just want to clarify, I was curious to get some feedback on the dynamic in Germany. You talked about not assuming any disruption in your guidance, but both parties having the ability to enjoying them. I was wondering, did your customers go for all the stocking, were they worried about what had happened in the past with an injunction and I guess why you're not assuming any kind of disruption going forward?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, you're right that these customers have been impacted by injunctions of one sort or another in the past so they have that. This was a response by the customers. I mean, they made the choice to buy this additional product to make sure that they had an uninterrupted supply of SAPIEN 3 and we took that as a compliment. We're very pleased that was done without any special discounts or anything to benefit it. It's tough for us to predict exactly how the dynamics are going to go in Germany, as you know it's not all our decisions, some of it depends on the other party. So I really don't have much else to add.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And probably the most encouraging thing here was just the uptick in the underlying U.S. utilization, and we talked about this a lot on the call. It seems like it's hard to pin down one thing, but what were the main factors that you think helped that to improve a little bit sequentially?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Well, I think the biggest thing for us is just the continued uptick in procedures per day. We got a little bit of lift, the same (01:00:50) from the new centers that were added. We probably would've expected that we would have been impacted by competition more and it didn't really come in the first quarter. That's probably going to come later on. So those are maybe, some of the key contributing factors.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Michael A.

[Operator instructions.] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Erickson, vice president of investor relations. Thank you, Mr. Erickson, you may begin.","David Erickson","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our first quarter 2012 financial results. During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, chairman and CEO; and Tom Abate, CFO.","Before I turn the call over to Mike, I'd like to remind you that during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions, and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, our expectations regarding sales and sales growth, gross profit margin, net income growth, earnings per share, SG&A, R&D, tax rates and free cash flow, diluted shares outstanding, foreign currency impacts, operating margin, and other financial expectations, including our assumptions regarding the timing and extent of the additional U.S. approvals, launches, and reimbursement for the SAPIEN Transcatheter Heart Valve.","These statements also include our current expectations for regulatory submissions and approvals related to a variety of new products and indications in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, as well as the timing, status, and expected outcomes of new or currently ongoing clinical trials; the expected impact, benefits of, and market potential for new product introductions; expectations regarding market growth; and potential impacts of economic conditions and competitive products.","These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Although we believe them to be reasonable, these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or experiences to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","Information concerning factors that could cause these differences may be found in our press release, our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and our other SEC filings, which are available on our website at edwards.com.","Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms \u201cunderlying\u201d and \u201cexcluding special items\u201d, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","","Michael Mussallem","Thank you David. This quarter was highlighted by an impressive first quarter of SAPIEN commercialization in the United States. Additionally, we\u2019re pleased that the growing body of longer-term evidence further supports the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter valve as an important therapy. And, with a scheduled FDA panel for cohort A and our approaching national coverage decision, the near term U.S. transcatheter opportunity will become more clear. ","At the same time, given current dynamics, which we\u2019ll discuss shortly, we are tempering the full year forecast for THV sales. And although we are lowering our overall 2012 expectations, excluding special items, we continue to expect underlying sales growth to be approximately 20% and earnings per share growth of 30%.","Before turning to the quarterly results, as a reminder, this year we\u2019ve begun reporting sales in three new product groups: surgical heart valve therapy, which combines surgical heart valves and cardiac surgery systems; transcatheter heart valves and critical care, which includes vascular. ","Reported sales grew 14% to $459 million, primarily driven by the U.S. launch of SAPIEN. On an underlying sales basis, they grew 13%. Sales outside the U.S. grew 7% on a regular basis, and represent approximately 60% of total sales. ","For the first quarter, the surgical heart valve therapy product group grew 3% to $204 million, which included $28 million from cardiac surgery systems. Within this product group, surgical heart valves grew 2% over last year. Outside the U.S., our surgical heart valves grew 7%, driven primarily by penetration of our premium products in Europe and Japan. ","Product pricing remains stable in each region. However, strong growth in emerging markets changed the country mix, which slightly lowered our overall global average price. In the U.S., the continued impact of a competitor\u2019s product introduction last year led to a modest decline in surgical heart valve sales this quarter. In the second half of 2012, we expect the impact to diminish as the competitive introduction annualizes. ","In Europe, we believe we gained share through the growth of our premium products. In Japan, we\u2019re pleased that our Magna Mitral Ease valve was approved in the first quarter, and customers are actively converting to this state-of-the-art mitral valve. Recently, a competitor received an earlier than expected approval of an aortic pericardial valve. We expect these impacts in Japan to be somewhat offsetting for the remainder of the year.","We continue to make good progress on our pipeline and are excited about the promise of these technologies. As previously announced, during the quarter we received CE mark for our Edwards INTUITY rapid deployment aortic valve system. As expected, we are initiating our CADENCE and Foundation European post-approval studies focused on the patient benefits and health economics of this new procedure compared to traditional open heart surgery. With this focus on clinical studies, we expect the INTUITY revenue contribution in 2012 to be modest, and to begin contributing to growth next year. ","Additionally, in Europe, we are enrolling in TRITON II, a clinical study of our next-generation INTUITY system, which features enhancements to both the delivery system and the valve. And for our next-generation tissue technology, GLX, we now expect to receive a CE mark in the second quarter of this year. ","In the U.S., we continue to expect an IDE approval by mid-year for an INTUITY clinical trial called Transform. At the upcoming AATS meeting, we expect several data presentations on Edwards innovations, including updated data from our TRITON European clinical trial for INTUITY.","Cardiac surgery system sales for the quarter were $20 million, up 5% on a reported basis, and an underlying basis. This growth was driven by our MIS portfolio and our base cannula products. As planned, in the first quarter, we initiated a limited launch of our IntraClude aortic occlusion device, which is designed to facilitate MIS mitral valve surgery.","Initial feedback has been positive, and we expect to broaden the launch in the second quarter. Our ProPlege retrograde cardioplegia device, designed to protect the heart during an MIS procedure, is on track for a limited launch later in the second quarter.","In summary, for 2012, we continue to expect to achieve underlying sales growth of 3-5% in the surgical heart valve therapy product group, driven by continued momentum of our newest products.","Turning to transcatheter heart valves, first quarter sales were $122 million, a 67% growth rate over last year, driven by the U.S. launch of SAPIEN, with sales of $41 million. Outside the U.S., underlying sales grew 20%, and were somewhat tempered by market dynamics in Europe and the $2-3 million in 29 mm stocking orders last year.","Overall, pricing remains stable. Transfemoral systems represented approximately 70% of our global sales, lifted by the U.S. commercial ramp, which is entirely transfemoral. ","Our growth in southern Europe was negative again this quarter, driven primarily by economic conditions. While we\u2019re not predicting an economic improvement in 2012, we do expect our new product introductions to turn growth positive in the second half. And even with the economic conditions in southern Europe, we anticipate Europe will grow at a robust rate of 20-25% this year.","With the anticipated mid-year launch of our 29 mm SAPIEN XT for transfemoral delivery, we expect to gain additional share. We\u2019re also look forward to the planned mid-year launch of Ascendra Plus, which gives us an improved transapical delivery and expected indication for transaortic delivery. We are the clear market share leader in Europe in transcatheter heart valves, and with these new product introductions we expect to strengthen our position. ","There have been some recent developments with European reimbursement. In France, the expected expansion in the number of hospitals approved to perform TAVR procedures was delayed. On a positive note, new guidance was issued in late March by the NHS in the U.K., which now recommends the use of TAVI for inoperable patients. We\u2019re already seeing the positive effects of this decision.","Turning to the U.S., we\u2019re very pleased to report that the total U.S. sales for our first full quarter of launch was $41 million, which included approximately $7 million of clinical sales. Of the $34 million in commercial sales, reorders, driven by higher than expected procedure volume, drove results, with only about 30% coming from stocking units.","Since the November launch, we\u2019ve trained approximately 60 centers. Reimbursement uncertainty has caused some centers to postpone their training and others to delay procedures. However, physician and hospital interest in our SAPIEN program remains very high, and we still expect to train 150-250 new commercial sites in the first 12 months.","As we\u2019ve previously stated, maintaining a high level of acute procedural success is our first priority, and continues to drive the pace of our SAPIEN rollout. We are very pleased with the high success rate that has been achieved.","In early February, CMS issued a draft proposal for its National Coverage Analysis for TAVR, and we submitted a formal response in early March. We continue to expect CMS to announce its final NCD in early May. We\u2019re pleased that the majority of regional Medicare contractors have continued to reimburse SAPIEN procedures on a case-by-case basis.","Recently, new CPT physician payment codes for transcatheter valve procedures were approved, which becomes effective in January of 2013. It\u2019s worth noting that these new codes will include additional reimbursement in recognition of the importance of having more than one physician in these procedures.","At ACC last month, data from the high-risk cohort A of the PARTNER trial were presented, and concurrently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The authors concluded that the two-year follow up supports the use of TAVR as an alternative to surgery in selected high-risk patients with aortic stenosis.","As we announced a few weeks ago, the FDA advisory panel for cohort A is scheduled for June 13. We had assumed an earlier panel date, and while we\u2019re disappointed by this one quarter delay, we are working constructively with the FDA. We remain confident that the advisory panel will acknowledge that the trial results clearly demonstrate the benefits of both TA and TF as less-invasive treatment options for high-risk surgical patients.","Turning to our PARTNER II clinical study, which is evaluating our SAPIEN XT technology, we are in the follow up phase of cohort B, which studies inoperable patients and continue to plan for a U.S. approval in 2014. Cohort A, the surgical arm, is studying up to 2000 patients with a lower risk profile than those in the PARTNER trial. Enrollment is well underway at approximately 25 centers, and we still expect to complete enrollment in 2013. ","In Europe, we continue to anticipate starting clinical trials in 2012 for two important new transcatheter valve platforms that we believe will enable us to reach more patients and further extend our leadership position. SAPIEN III is our next-generation balloon expandable valve that builds on all our knowledge and experience, and includes a unique feature designed to reduce perivalvular leak.","CENTERA, our repositionable self-expanding valve, features a motorized delivery system designed for a stable deployment and single operator use. The most notable aspect of both systems is that they are low profile and delivered through a 14-French e-sheath. Early first-in-human experiences on SAPIEN III and CENTERA are scheduled to be presented next month at EuroPCR. Also at that conference, contemporary 30-day SAPIEN XT data will be presented from over 2,000 patients whose enrollment was completed late last year. In Japan, we remain on track for an expected regulatory approval of SAPIEN XT in 2013. ","We are initiating our pro-TAVI trial to study the causes of stroke and evaluate our umbrella device and expect to begin enrolling in the second quarter. The results of this study should become available later this year, and could support a 510k for umbrella in the U.S.","With respect to our THV patent litigation with Medtronic Core Valve, we continue to expect a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals by mid-2012.","In summary, for 2012 we are lowering the range of our expected overall THV sales by $30 million. There are three components to this change, including the one-quarter delay in the expected approval of SAPIEN for high-risk surgical patients in the U.S., the market dynamics in Europe, and the effect of current foreign exchange rates.","We now expect $200-240 million of clinical and commercial sales in the U.S. The stronger procedural growth we are currently experiencing is expected to somewhat offset the anticipated one-quarter delay for the cohort A approval.","For the full year, we now expect THV sales in the range of $530-600 million, and an underlying growth rate over last year that is likely to exceed 70%.","Turning to the critical care product group, total sales for the quarter were $134 million, which included $12 million from vascular products. Within the product group, critical care sales were $122 million for the quarter, up 1% on a reported basis. More than $4 million of discontinued product reduced growth by about 4%.","Sales growth in the first quarter was driven by advanced monitoring products in Europe and the U.S., offset by the discontinued products and the strong prior year results in Japan. Our newest products, EV 1000 and Volume View, continue to gain acceptance. We look forward to introducing the next generation globally in mid-2012, particularly in Japan, where we expect these products to have significant impact.","With respect to our glucose program, in the first quarter we completed the first phase of our GlucoClear clinical evaluation in Europe, and we are encouraged by the accuracy results and positive clinician feedback. We continue to expect a CE mark before the end of 2012 on an enhanced system.","Total reported vascular sales, which is comprised of our Fogarty products, were $13 million this quarter, down slightly from the prior year. For 2012, we continue to expect full year underlying sales growth for the critical care product group of 5-8%, with important contributions from Asia and the launch of our next-generation EV 1000 platform.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.  ","Thomas Abate","Thanks Mike. This quarter, our strong sales performance, driven by the U.S. launch of SAPIEN, allowed us to achieve diluted EPS of $0.55 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.53, which exceeded the top end of our guidance. ","With significant transcatheter investments and SG&A already in place, we expect our operating margin to improve significantly as sales rise. However, as Mike mentioned, due to a number of factors, we have reduced our full year projected sales for transcatheter valves, which is the driver of our $0.12 reduction to full year estimated diluted EPS.","For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 72.3%, compared to 71.1% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven primarily by a more profitable product mix. For 2012, we continue to expect our gross profit margin to build throughout the year as THV sales grow. For full year 2012, excluding special items, our guidance remains between 73% and 75%. ","First quarter SG&A expenses were $177 million, or 38.6% of sales, an increase of 18% over the past year. This increase was driven primarily by U.S. transcatheter launch-related investments. We continue to expect SG&A to be between 36% and 39% of sales for the full year. As a percentage of sales, SG&A should trend down during the year.","R&D investments in the quarter grew 16% to $69 million, or 15% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of additional investments in clinical studies and new product development efforts in our transcatheter valve program. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be between 14% and 15%. ","Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 23.9%, lower than expected due to the release of reserves related to a pending settlement. Without the specific benefit, our rate was 26.6%. Excluding special items, we expect our rate to be approximately 27% for the next two quarters, and drop to approximately 22% in the fourth quarter, due to our anticipation of the federal R&D tax credit renewal.","FX rates did not have a material effect on either sales or earnings in the quarter. Looking forward, if rates remain unchanged, the picture changes substantially, resulting in a $45 million negative impact to full year sales compared to last year.","Free cash flow used during the quarter was $49 million. We define this as cash flow used in operating activities of $31 million, plus capital spending of $18 million. While it\u2019s not unusual for our first quarter cash flow to be negligible, this quarter\u2019s outflow resulted primarily from $38 million of anticipated annual excess tax benefits from stock plans, which was fully recorded in our first quarter. For full year 2012, excluding special items, we continue to expect free cash flow to be between $240 million and $260 million. ","During the quarter, we spent approximately $100 million on share repurchases, which includes $54 million for an accelerated share repurchase program. We received approximately 80% of the shares under this program in the first quarter, and will receive the balance in the second. For modeling purposes, we now project fully diluted shares outstanding to be 118 million in 2012.","Turning to our balance sheet, we had total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $410 million, and total debt of $179 million. Short term investments were $196 million, and represent highly liquid bank timed deposits. ","Our DSO at the end of the quarter was 65 days, consistent with the prior quarter. Inventory turns were 1.9, a small increase from the prior quarter.","Turning to our 2012 sales guidance, at current exchange rates, for surgical heart valve therapy we continue to expect sales to be between $800 million and $830 million, which includes approximately $115 million of cardiac surgery system sales. In transcatheter heart valves, we now expect sales of $530 million to $600 million. Lastly, in critical care, we now expect sales at the bottom of the $580 million to $610 million range, which includes approximately $50 million of vascular sales.","We now expect full year total sales at the low end of our original range of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion. Excluding special items, we now expect full year 2012 net income growth of approximately 30% and diluted EPS of $2.58 to $2.68.","For the second quarter 2012, we project total sales of $470 million to $500 million, and second quarter diluted EPS, excluding special items, to be between $0.64 and $0.68.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mike.","Michael Mussallem","Thanks Tom. As we continue to expand our U.S. introduction and make progress toward the completion of several notable upcoming milestones, we remain as optimistic as ever about the long term growth opportunity represented by transcatheter valves. Nearly every day we are reminded just how impactful our SAPIEN technology is to patients suffering from severe aortic stenosis.","More broadly, we believe it is our focus on innovation to address unmet patient needs that continues to create value for all of our stakeholders. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to David. ","David Erickson","Thank you Mike. In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and we\u2019ll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the hour.","Operator, we\u2019re ready for questions please. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. ","Bruce Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Mike, could you just talk qualitatively about the level of enthusiasm - you know, hospitals have to invest $3-5 million to build a hybrid cath lab. Could you just talk about qualitatively your level of interest in making that sort of investment? And I have a follow up.","Michael Mussallem","Well, the level of enthusiasm continues to be very high from hospitals. I think it would be an exaggeration to say that every hospital that starts a transcatheter program needs to build a hybrid OR. They don\u2019t necessarily have to do that. They could upgrade a cath lab if they can get sufficient air turns and so forth. So there\u2019s other ways of getting there more economically. Many hospitals do step up and go for the hybrid, though, Bruce. ","Bruce Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","And a follow up, Mike. The one thing that was very striking to me at ACC was the association between perivalvular leak and excess mortality. I think it was like 15% if there was any present. You know, they didn\u2019t prove causality, but how important does your team feel that reducing the rate of perivalvular leak from 50% of the patients with at least some sign of it, how much of an impact could that have on outcomes going forward? ","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, that was a very thoughtful question, Bruce. You\u2019re right, the causality has not be demonstrated, but it\u2019s certainly caught the attention of physicians. We know they\u2019re very focused on reducing the leak, because of the possibility that it might be related. So we see more emphasis on that than ever. We see people are really focused on sizing. They\u2019re using CT more often. They\u2019re doing more reballooning. They may even be starting to drift toward larger sizes a little bit more. So it\u2019s just sort of a head nod to the way clinicians are reacting to that effect.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gunderson from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. ","Tom Gunderson - Piper Jaffray","First question is on NCD, Mike, or the NCA, whichever. The tracking statement online still says May 2nd. You said early May. Do you see any reason why it wouldn\u2019t be May 2nd? And also, related to that, has there been any change in the reimbursement amount tracking to the same DRGs that we\u2019ve known for a while?  ","Michael Mussallem","No, I don\u2019t know any reason to believe that it won\u2019t be May 2nd. We think that that is clearly where they\u2019re headed. And in terms of the amount that it\u2019s tracking to, I\u2019m not aware of any change to the amount. It continues to track to the high-risk surgical aortic valve replacement.  ","Tom Gunderson - Piper Jaffray","And then, related to that is that you\u2019ve mentioned that some of the new startups have postponed because of confusion on reimbursement, and I\u2019ve talked to some existing hospitals that feel as though they\u2019re holding back on patients. Do you expect, and are you ready for, a bolus of patients that might come through after CMS makes its final decision? ","Michael Mussallem","You know, we\u2019re not sure exactly how that\u2019s going to work out, Tom. Even once that NCD is out, it\u2019s going to need to be interpreted by the local providers and I understand that actually instructions come sometime after the NCD is out, a matter of weeks later. And so I don\u2019t know that this will be a step function, but rather something that sorts out over a period of time. Some sites did indeed delay, and others basically came in and filled their plate. So for people that stepped out of line, there\u2019s a pretty good queue of people that stepped in behind them. So most of our slots got filled.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. ","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Just a couple on the guidance. First, Tom, on profitability. Did I hear you correctly that the reduction in EPS of roughly $0.12 is primarily related to that $30 million reduction in your TAVI assumptions? ","Thomas Abate","Yes, you did, Bob. It\u2019s not entirely, but it\u2019s primarily. ","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","So that gives us a little glimpse into incremental profitability. That would suggest an incremental margin on TAVI of about 65% if my math is correct, unless I\u2019m doing something incorrectly there. ","Thomas Abate","Well, there\u2019s a few moving parts there, and that\u2019s where I\u2019d say you probably don\u2019t want to draw too much from that analysis. I think it\u2019s an indication but there are other things in there that could throw you off. ","Michael Mussallem","I think it\u2019s worth noting, Bob, for example, there\u2019s expenses that also track along with that. For example, the training expense and so forth, if those don\u2019t come on as soon. ","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Right, and I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for, as you move forward and grow this business, the incremental profitability that gets layered on as you grow across a more and more fixed cost base. It\u2019s just an impressive look at profitability here is the point. And then the second question is just on what happened in the quarter. Just want to make sure I\u2019ve got the breakdown correctly for U.S. So you did $41 million in sales. I think you said $7 million of that was related to trial revenues, leaving $34 for clinical. And then I think you said about $10 million was related to stocking, and $24 million related to implants. Is that correct? ","Michael Mussallem","Yeah. ","Thomas Abate","It comes out about that way. I think, what did we say, 30%? ","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Okay, and so my question is in the new centers, the 60 new centers, can you give us a sense as to the implant trends that you\u2019re seeing as those new centers come on in terms of, you know, what\u2019s the average number of implants you\u2019re seeing on a weekly or monthly basis among those new centers? And then related to that, it looks like you\u2019re lowering the midpoint of the U.S. guidance by about $10 million. And yet I would calculate that the delay in PARTNER A would have reduced U.S. guidance by more like $20 million or $30 million, so is the delta there that just the other stuff is going much better than you thought in terms of implant rates, and that\u2019s why the reduction is really only $10 million? ","Michael Mussallem","The first one here, about the averages, that\u2019s not that helpful, because it\u2019s pretty highly variable at this point in time. The experienced centers, those that have well developed networks and referral patterns, they have the ability to do a lot of cases. The new centers - and when we gave this number of centers that were trained, the 60, that meant that they\u2019ve been through our fundamentals training, and so in some cases the centers literally had no implants in the quarter. And so averages don\u2019t become very meaningful. We\u2019re in this time where there\u2019s a pretty great variance between centers. ","And as it relates to the impact that you suggested was around $10 million in the U.S. Yes, in fact, the delay of a cohort A panel and a one-quarter delay overall is worth more than $10 million, and it is indeed this ramp that is faster than we had anticipated that\u2019s mitigating some of that impact. And that\u2019s why only around $10 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Balla from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. ","Amit Balla - Citigroup","I had a question regarding Europe and the TAVI adoption over there, in two parts. First, can you talk about what impact competition is having over there. And can you parse that out against the underlying market dynamics in western and southern Europe? ","Michael Mussallem","Sure. The two new competitors, you know, they\u2019re not strategic at this point, and they\u2019ve had some impact, but it hasn\u2019t been very large. They basically really have just been in Germany, and we estimate maybe 125 implants or something like that in the quarter. So maybe that gives you a sense for that. As we indicated in our prepared remarks, we think Europe is going to grow somewhere in this 20-25% range overall as a total market in 2012. We think it probably grew something like that in this quarter. Is there more that I can answer about that? ","Amit Balla - Citigroup","Yeah, I guess competition, I was thinking more about larger-sized valves. You have a new valve that will be coming out this summer, but one of your major competitors has one there already. So I was actually focused on that part of the competition question. And Europe, parsing out the regions, was more about southern Europe, like what you\u2019re seeing there. Any pullback there? ","Michael Mussallem","Well, let me get into southern Europe, and then maybe a comment about share. Southern Europe probably as an overall region was around flat again this quarter. For us it was actually negative. I think it was probably close to minus 20% sales growth. Again, southern Europe only accounts for probably a little less than 20% of the overall market. So you can see that it did pull down the overall growth of Europe. ","In terms of the importance of 29 mm, we feel like we\u2019re the clear share leader, and we think that having a 29 mm in the transfemoral position is going to be very important. Remember, when we got that 29 mm in the transapical position, about a year ago, it really added a lot of sales. And we think it\u2019s going to be powerful. ","And since TF is the preferred method of delivery, it might even pull some of that 29 mm TA volume away. So it\u2019s a positive for us. We think it\u2019s going to be a real share gainer, that drives share in the transfemoral position. We\u2019re also excited about having the new Ascendra Plus, because it\u2019s going to open up the transaortic delivery. And although that\u2019s still relatively small, maybe 150 implants a quarter, it\u2019s growing, and we haven\u2019t had an indication thus far. So those have all largely been competitive units until now. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies & Co. Please proceed with your question. ","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Co. ","Wondering if I could just ask you to expand a little bit on your commentary on the distribution of volume at the various types of centers. When you look at the highest-volume centers, whether it\u2019s Columbia University or Cedars Sinai, the big PARTNER trials, do you have a sense of what percentage of valves are being done at these highest-volume centers right now? ","Michael Mussallem","I don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t normally cut it that way. Let\u2019s put it this way. You think about the volume that was done in the United States. We said about $7 million of that was clinical, so I\u2019ll set the $7 million aside. We said out of the $34 million, a good 30% of that was stocking. So none of those stocking orders came from the large sites. So now if you further parse that down to a smaller part, out of the remaining, I would imagine the large centers made a substantial impact. I don\u2019t know if it was half of that, but it was significant. They\u2019re experienced, and they have well developed referral networks.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Co. ","Okay. You know, you described the SAPIEN III, you gave us a little teaser there on some new technology that might address perivalvular leakage. Is there anything more you can comment on on what that is at this point?  ","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, you know, we haven\u2019t laid out the design exactly. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get a chance to learn a little bit more about it at PCR. Obviously one of the most exciting features has been designed, and it\u2019s a very innovative design, such that it can go through a 14-French eSheath. But in particular, it has a design feature that\u2019s really pointed at reducing and having a substantial impact on perivalvular leak. For competitive reasons we haven\u2019t put it out there, but at some point here it will become clear to everybody. It won\u2019t be a secret. We\u2019re going to be in clinical trials by the end of the year hopefully.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","First, on reimbursement, when the NCD comes out in a week or so. We\u2019ve been hearing that some of the more challenging language that was in the original proposal may be less so in the final proposal, such as requiring clinical trials to have a superiority end point for reimbursement, and making sure that [interventionalists] have structural heart experience. Is it your understanding that in the final language it will be slightly more favorable than the proposal? Any of your thoughts. And I had a follow up.","Michael Mussallem","We don\u2019t know, Glenn, obviously. We just don\u2019t have an inside track on exactly what that\u2019s going to say. I think we\u2019re pretty clearly on the record of agreeing with the two comments that you just made. We don\u2019t think it should be restricted to superiority trials, and we think there should be some real care in credentialing. We think it\u2019s more important to credential the team rather than some of the specific physician based credentialing that can be too restrictive in terms of access to patients. But we\u2019re not going to know exactly how that works out. We\u2019re hopeful. The good news here is there\u2019s been a collaborative style by CMS, and we\u2019re very pleased that they\u2019ve taken input. But we\u2019re, like you, anxious to see what the final language says. ","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","And just a quick follow up. When you look outside the U.S. to Europe, you mentioned France, the country not allowing more hospitals to implant. Does that really impact the sales much? Do patients find their way to the implanting centers? And then are there any new geographies or countries that you\u2019ll be launching outside the U.S. this year? ","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, in France, in particular what we were referring to, there was a rule - and I\u2019m probably not using the right term here - but there was a rule out that suggested there was going to be an addition of more centers in 2012, and that got postponed. So we\u2019re expecting there are going to be approximately 10 more centers that we expect to come online later this year. And we do indeed think it will make a difference. We think there\u2019s a lack of coverage in France without these centers. And that was a determination that was made at their government level.","In terms of the positives, the U.K., you know, stepping forward. This decision that they made to pay for nonoperable patients is a real positive. And we\u2019re already seeing that effect, even though it\u2019s not even in effect yet. We saw a positive indication recently out of Scotland, which was great. On the downside, we still don\u2019t have a positive indication out of Belgium, so we\u2019re awaiting that. And we\u2019re continuing to make slow but steady progress across Asia as we\u2019re working through various approval processes. But nothing as meaningful as Japan to talk about at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. ","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Mike, just two clarification questions and then one O-U.S. question. The 60 new centers, is that by the end of Q1, or is that to date? In the U.S. ","Michael Mussallem","That was at the end of Q1 from the approval date. ","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Got it. And you said transapical was stable sequentially in Europe, if I heard you correctly? ","Michael Mussallem","That\u2019s correct. ","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","My question, then, is O-U.S. growth, the new guidance assumes it\u2019s about 10-20%. I think it\u2019s 9-18% growth in 2012, which is a big deceleration from last year. There\u2019s new competition coming next year in 2013 in Europe. Can you walk us through why you think international growth can continue to be positive and strong beyond 2012?   ","Michael Mussallem","I\u2019m not sure exactly. I think you must have backed into a number, because I think what you referred to was something that I didn\u2019t share. But what we feel like is in Europe, even with the slowdown in southern Europe, we expect it to grow in the 20-25% range this year. We think it might have grown probably 25%-plus that this year, otherwise. And last year it grew 35%. ","And so considering the size of that European market, that\u2019s still pretty significant, and if you look at penetration rates across Europe, they\u2019re still, I would say, low and highly variable. So for example there\u2019s a big difference between the penetration rate in many of the countries in Europe and the more penetrated countries like Germany. ","So there\u2019s still an awful lot of potential and we really are only in western Europe at this point. So the [ascension] countries are yet to be penetrated at all to speak of, let alone what might happen in Asia. So we\u2019re still very bullish about what\u2019s going to happen beyond this. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. ","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Mike, I was hoping you could actually go into a little more detail on the surgical valve business. One of your competitors has been pretty vocal about the success of their product launch in the United States. Can you just talk about your level of confidence in that abating in the second half of the year? Is that just the comps? Or is there something specific that you think fundamentally can drive business back in your direction? ","Michael Mussallem","We have a little bit of experience with competitive new product launches, and in particular where we see the most acute effect is during the first year of launch. One of the things that happens during the first year of launch often is clinical trialing, and it\u2019s not uncommon for surgeons to be willing to try a new valve. That doesn\u2019t always stick. In some case it does, and in other cases they all retreat back to their favorite valve. ","And so we expect this really to mitigate in the second half of the year, based on that impact. And also, we have a little bit of experience in Europe. That exact same valve was launched earlier in Europe and at this point that\u2019s already anniversaried, and we grew in mid-single digits in Europe, which is probably a little faster than the market grew. And so some indication why we have some confidence.","And besides that, the whole market we\u2019re expecting might step up a little bit with transcatheter heart valves coming into the U.S. market. We would think it might give the market a bit of a lift as well. ","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","And maybe just following onto that, and also coming back to the delta on the transcatheter valve guides. And could you maybe provide a little bit more detail on the assumptions that you\u2019ve considered in the revised guidance given, clearly, the amount of nervousness coming into the quarter and some of the variances on Street models and expectations around the transcatheter valve? If you could just give us some perspective as to what kind of acceleration you\u2019re assuming, and are you taking into account a step-up in the surgical valve market here? Just to give some greater confidence bars around these numbers. ","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, I think the change in sales guidance really is primarily all around transcatheter heart valves. And I think we shared that there were three components of that. One is the foreign currency. As Tom indicated, that really didn\u2019t have much impact on the first quarter, but we expect that it\u2019s going to have something in the neighborhood of $10 million worth of impact in transcatheter heart valves alone for the remainder of the year. ","The other impact we talked about was just dynamics in Europe, and compared to our original assumptions, we think that that might be as much as something in the neighborhood of $10 million less. And then we feel like in the U.S., even though there\u2019s what\u2019s anticipated to be, say, a quarter delay in the approval of cohort A of the PARTNER trial. We think that does get mitigated by the strong first quarter and this ramp that we felt, that was not just driven by stocking orders, but it\u2019s driven by real procedures and reordering. And just take a look at the $40 million number and ramp that by itself, and you can probably see why we have a level of confidence.  ","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay, so essentially you\u2019re looking at the utilization rates exiting the quarter and assuming that that continues to accelerate up as it did throughout Q1 in the balance of the year? ","Michael Mussallem","Yes, we think it\u2019s a ramp.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","I guess back at the investor day you guys had talked a little bit about the cadence of sales for the U.S. with more of a flattish sequential pattern, just because of consignment. I was wondering, with the pushout of timing for cohort A, are you still expecting to see that sort of cadence, or have you changed your thinking upon doing consignment at all? ","Michael Mussallem","Nothing has changed in terms of our strategy. It\u2019s a little hard to predict, because our procedures are a little higher. Remember the effect that we predicted. We said early on we would get a boost from stocking orders. So we would actually have sales higher than procedures, and then later on, when people demonstrated large volume, we would move to consignment, and that consignment effect would actually depress reported sales in the procedure driven sales, because they would go to consignment. That effect is still in place. Exactly how those two net against each other, we have models on, but we really can\u2019t be sure. And to know exactly what\u2019s happening on a month by month basis is pretty murky at this point. But broadly, we still stand by the same phenomenon.  ","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","And just to clarify, the greater sales in the quarter you said were more procedure driven, versus stocking or clinical trial? ","Michael Mussallem","That\u2019s right. We try to give enough definition so that you can sort that out, but we would say it\u2019s 70% procedure. Set aside the clinical trial of $7 million that we talked about in the U.S. Out of the remainder, 70% was procedure, 30% stocking. And we would say compared to the guidance that we provided to you, we felt like procedures came in stronger. ","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and then just big picture, it seems that certainly transcatheter valve sales, at least now, are certainly ramping up better than what you\u2019re expecting. They\u2019re clearly very profitable, as evidenced by just the changing guidance, and then the reduction in EPS. So with this anticipated large influx of cash flow to come, what are you thinking just in terms of usage in terms of M&A? We\u2019ve typically seen a lot of companies look to diversify their sales base and just wondering if that\u2019s something that you\u2019ve given a lot of thought to going forward? Just how do you think about that? ","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, we do give thought to it. There\u2019s really no change in our strategy. We\u2019re very consistent. We\u2019re going to stay focused. We don\u2019t believe that we need to diversify. We feel like there\u2019s plenty of growth and unmet needs around structural heart disease and critical care monitoring, and so we\u2019ll continue to look for the right opportunities. Tom talked about the fact that we did a purchase program with stock. We\u2019ll continue to do that when we think conditions warrant it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. ","Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan","I probably just want to circle back on a couple of items. Maybe first question, the request to expand on the Anderson patents, have you filed that subsequent to product approval?  ","Michael Mussallem","We did file it. As a matter of fact, we did receive the one-year extension. So this was what we anticipated. It\u2019s kind of an interim. You get this one year at a time. But the one year actually has happened.  ","Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan","Great. Let me make sure I understand the guidance commentary, because obviously if we just looked at EPS, you came in at $0.05 above this quarter, the consensus, and you\u2019re guiding to a number in the second quarter that\u2019s about at the midpoint, $0.07 above consensus. But you\u2019re saying the back half of the year is in essence relative to your own prior guidance - and this is a little bit of apples and oranges - $0.24 below. So you\u2019re lowering your full year by $0.12. ","But the degree to which consensus had the first half right, you\u2019re telling the Street to take that much out of the back half of the year. And I just want to make sure I understand that. I thought Bob kind of got to one of our questions, which was that the incremental profitability of TAVI for you guys, which is helpful. But maybe just help us understand that a bit, Tom. You\u2019re taking a big chunk of earnings out of this back half of \u201912.  ","Thomas Abate","Sure, and Mike, it\u2019s consistent with the idea that we got the one quarter delay. Also, some of the things in Europe, some of the dynamics that Mike talked about there, are probably more affecting what we had expected in the second half versus what we thought in the first half. So a little bit of delay there also.","The other thing - and I tried to mention that with Bob - is to take that number, the math is not only THV. We move within ranges often, and so when we make a change on the bottom, there\u2019s a little bit of change maybe in a couple of other things. So I would not take that math totally literally. It\u2019s fair to make it an indication of the profitability, but I wouldn\u2019t go too far with that.","But indeed, as you\u2019re suggesting, most of our change happened in the back half versus our expectations. ","Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan","Okay, and then last question is related to the national coverage decision and the expansion on cohort A. So assuming you get the labeling for cohort A, will there be any restrictions either from the FDA or CMS on the use of the transapical in cohort B patients? ","Michael Mussallem","What we\u2019re going to have to see is exactly what the label looks like coming from FDA, and what the CMS language looks like. One of the things that was, we thought, quite encouraging in the draft NCD was the use of coverage with evidence development, which suggests a flexible NCD that would have the ability to move with the FDA indication. And we\u2019re hopeful that that\u2019s the case, such that the transapical procedures would be reimbursed consistent with the label. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills from Canaccord. Please proceed with your question. ","Jason Mills - Canaccord","Let me go back to profitability real quick. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a sense, quantitatively, where you are at this point in the U.S. as it relates to the sales and marketing training, reimbursement infrastructure, the things that would hit the SG&A line in the U.S. for TAVR. Where are you in terms of building that out at this point? Clearly you will add reps, etc., as your revenue builds, but I\u2019m just curious, as you think about the initial investments there outside of regulatory where you are. To try to get a difference in for profitability. ","Thomas Abate","In fact, we do have a substantial portion that\u2019s already in it. But I think you nailed it in the fact that we will increase expenses. I think the best thing to look at, probably because most of this will occur in SG&A, is think about the guidance in terms of the range for SG&A. We know we\u2019re going to see leverage there despite the fact that they\u2019re increasing. But I don\u2019t know how to give you a specific number in terms of another reference point. But I think that would probably be the best way to look at it. ","Jason Mills - Canaccord","So did I hear you right, Tom, that the upper end of your TAVI range would correspond more closely with the lower end of your total SG&A guidance? ","Thomas Abate","Right. Correct. ","Jason Mills - Canaccord","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And sorry if I missed it, the transapical transfemoral mix outside the U.S., did you give that, Mike? ","Michael Mussallem","No, we didn\u2019t give that. We gave sort of an overall. ","Jason Mills - Canaccord","70-30 overall. ","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, exactly. And I don\u2019t have it off the top of my head, but you could probably back into it. The clinical trial has both transapical and transfemoral, though mostly TF, and the U.S. commercial sales is all TF.  ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Nam from ThinkEquity. Please proceed with your question. ","Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity","Mike, did you mention that you had trained 60 centers at this point? ","Michael Mussallem","Yes. ","Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity","And so to get to your 150-250 range, should we expect somewhat of a linear growth on the number of centers being trained each quarter? Or do you expect more of a back-loaded ramp up here? ","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, there is a bit of a ramp. So again, let me just remind you what we indicated. We said, since launch - and remember this is since the first week in November - we\u2019ve trained 60 centers as of the end of the first quarter. So you can see that captures a little [unintelligible], but there clearly has been a ramp. And we\u2019ve come up. ","And so we\u2019ve got a lot of hospitals that are in the queue and there tends to be a little bit of churn early on as some people were prepared and others weren\u2019t prepared. That\u2019s lining out. We certainly have more than enough capacity. We have the ability to ramp that. And some of this will be driven by whatever the NCD says as well. So we\u2019ll see how it goes. Based on everything we know, we think the 150-250 tends to be real solid. ","Remember there\u2019s one other thing, that once we get cohort A approved, we\u2019re going to ask centers that weren\u2019t part of the PARTNER trial and already don\u2019t have TA experience to come back through training. It might be a one day training that they come back through. So some training capacity will go into that at that point in time. ","Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity","That\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of lead time, once a hospital gets trained, what kind of lead time do they have before they can start implanting on a regular basis, if you will? I know the term regular basis is a little bit of a moving target, but is that a four-week lead time? Three-week lead time? How should we think about that? ","Michael Mussallem","When hospitals come in for training, they bring patients, and typically that\u2019s five patients that they bring in such that these are real patients that are ready to go. They can schedule the proctor right away. And sometimes can actually start cases as soon as a week after their training. So it just depends on how aggressive they are and how fast they\u2019re ready to move.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Please proceed with your question. ","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley Smith Barney","Mike, in the U.S., can you speak to the mix of delivery approaches for SAPIEN, non-transfemoral approaches? I\u2019m just wondering, can you give a sense of what that mix is? Has reimbursement been a problem for those procedures for some of the tertiary centers? And can that issue be addressed specifically with the NCD? ","Michael Mussallem","You know, the only thing that is approved at this point, you\u2019re aware, is transfemoral for nonoperable patients. And so anybody that does something other than that is really doing some kind of a compassionate case. At this point, I think everybody\u2019s clearly focused on nonoperable patients, and I\u2019m sure there have been some cases that have been done that are not transfemoral, but I don\u2019t know exactly what those numbers are at this point. ","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley Smith Barney","Would it surprise you if that number were greater than 10% of the U.S. cases? ","Michael Mussallem","I really don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a good question. ","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley Smith Barney","Okay. But the reality is because of the label, that issue probably does not go away with the NCD. ","Michael Mussallem","No, that\u2019s right. But I think the NCD tries to accommodate that through coverage with evidence development. But we\u2019ll see exactly what the new language looks like. But what is anticipated is if we were collecting data - and again, we\u2019re supportive of this idea of collecting all patients in a registry - and if we do it in a proper fashion, that there\u2019s a good chance for people to be paid.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Erickson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Erickson, you may begin.","David Erickson","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our fourth quarter 2012 financial results. During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A.","Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Abate, CFO. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I'd like to remind you that during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, our expectations regarding sales and sales growth, gross profit margin, earnings per share, SG&A, R&D, taxes, free cash flow, diluted shares outstanding and foreign currency impacts. These statements also include our current expectations for the timing, status and expected outcomes of our clinical trials, regulatory submissions and approvals, reimbursement conditions, as well as expectations regarding the U.S. launch of SAPIEN, other new product introductions and our pipeline.","These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Although we believe them to be reasonable, these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or experiences to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences may be found in our press release; our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011; and our other SEC filings, which are available on our website at edwards.com. Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, excluding special items, and adjusted for special items, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release.","Now, I will turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem","Thank you, David. Our fourth quarter capped the year of significant progress as we introduced our innovative SAPIEN technology to the U.S. We're very proud that more than 5,000 patients in the U.S. have been treated with our transcatheter valve since launch, and we're aggressively investing to expand the availability of this important therapy. In spite of a difficult economic environment, underlying sales were up 16% in 2012 driven by a strong finish in each of our product lines. During the year, we continue to invest in new technologies to treat even more patients in the future. The significant increase in R&D investments in 2012 helped fuel important progress in our transcatheter and surgical valve therapy programs, as well as our Critical Care technologies.","In the fourth quarter, we also adjusted for a couple of special items. Tom will explain our treatment of the R&D tax credit during his comments. Separately, I wanted to mention the realignment charge. We think that one of the keys to remaining an innovative company is to constantly adapt. From time to time, we reallocate our resources to better align with our strategy, which helps minimize the need for larger corrections in the future.","Now, turning to the quarterly results. Reported sales grew 19% to $511 million. Sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange was 21%. Total U.S. sales grew 46%, and represent a growing proportion of our total sales.","In transcatheter heart valves, fourth quarter sales of $161 million grew 77% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven by the ongoing U.S. launch of SAPIEN. In the U.S. THV sales were $81 million for the quarter, which included clinical sales of $7 million and net stocking sales of $16 million. As a reminder, the net stocking figure also includes the offsetting impact of qualified hospitals transitioning to consignment status.","Transapical systems comprise nearly 45% of U.S. THV sales.  Quarterly THV sales grew 46% sequentially driven primarily by the October approval of Cohort A. At the end of 2012, 150 sites were trained on the transapical approach, which reflects the high level of interest among Heart teams to offer this important alternate delivery approach to the large number of patients who can't be treated with our current transfemoral device. We believe a significant number of the TA patients who are on the sidelines were treated during this quarter. Clinicians continue to maintain a very high procedural success rate during the introduction of the TA system.","Today, more than 200 sites commercially offer SAPIEN, and we expect to train an additional 200 new sites over the next 2 years. As we train centers, we continue to require a stocking order, yet at the same time, we expect the impact of consignment to grow in existing centers. As a result, in 2013, we anticipate the impact to reported sales from net stocking to trend from positive to a negative.  In 2014, we expect reported sales to begin tracking procedures performed.","Outside the U.S., THV sales grew 6% or 10% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In Europe, we believe the market grew approximately 10%. We continue to -- we estimate our share position increased slightly, while the implementation of volume discounts and country mix resulted in an overall lower ASP. Growth was strongest again in Germany, while ongoing austerity measures resulted in negative growth in Southern Europe.","Transfemoral units outside the U.S. grew by more than 35% while non-transfemoral units declined again this quarter, driven by Heart teams who continue to employ a transfemoral-first approach. We estimate that competitive transapical products continue to be of minimal impact in the quarter.","Turning to our U.S. PARTNER II clinical study, which is evaluating our SAPIEN XT technology, we're continuing to enroll patients in Cohort A, the surgical arm, and we continue to expect to complete enrollment by midyear. Early next month, 1 year data from PARTNER II Cohort B as well as 3-year PARTNER Cohort A data are scheduled to be presented as latebreaking clinical trials at ACC. We're continuing to work toward a midyear PMA submission for PARTNER II Cohort B, which we anticipate leads to an approval of SAPIEN XT in the U.S. next year.","We're pleased to have begun enrollment in January for the CE mark trial of our pioneering SAPIEN 3 valve, which is delivered through a 14-French eSheath and designed to reduce paravalvular leak. This keeps us on track to receive a CE Mark and launch this product in Europe by year-end.","Later this year in Europe, we expect to complete enrollment for both our novel self-expanding CENTERA valve trial and our PROTAVI study, which is evaluating the causes of stroke and our umbrella device. In Japan, we continue to expect to receive both regulatory approval and reimbursement for our SAPIEN XT valve by year-end, which positions us to have the first commercially available transcatheter valve in that country.","In summary, we're pleased with the progress of the U.S. launch, which drove total THV sales of $552 million for 2012. We continue to expect underlying transcatheter heart valve sales to grow 30% to 45% in 2013. This would result in global sales of $710 million to $790 million, which includes $390 million to $440 million of sales in the U.S.","Turning to the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy Product group, sales for the quarter were $198 million, which included $29 million from Cardiac Surgery Systems. Surgical heart valve's grew 3% over last year or 5%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S. sales grew 2.5% this quarter. Growth outside the U.S. was up 7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Highlighted by the strong adoption of Magna Mitral Ease valve in Japan and the double-digit sales growth in emerging markets.","In November, we received approval and launched our mitral pericardial valve in China. Our pricing was stable in each region although our global ASP declined slightly due to the faster growth in emerging markets. We continue to make progress on our key milestones with INTUITY. In the U.S, our TRANSFORM Trial remains on schedule. Enrollment is complete in CADENCE MIS in Germany and our other INTUITY trials in Europe are progressing.","Early this year, we began enrollment in our U.S. IDE trial called COMMENCE, using our GLX tissue platform on our Magna Ease aortic surgical valve. Later in the fourth quarter, we received additional clearance to include our Magna Mitral Ease valve in this study.","In Cardiac Surgery Systems, sales for the quarter were $29 million, up 7% on a reported basis or 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These results were due primarily to the growth of MIS products, which include the launch of our ProPlege retrograde cardioplegia device.","In 2013, we continue to expect underlying sales growth in the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group to be 4% to 6%.  We expect our sales growth to ramp up during the year, driven primarily by the commercialization of INTUITY, the diminishing impact of competitive products in the U.S. and new MIS launches.","Turning to the Critical Care product group, total sales for the quarter were $152 million, which included $14 million from vascular products. Within this product group, Critical Care sales were $138 million for the quarter, growing 4% or 6% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Growth was driven primarily by our advanced monitoring products in Japan and the U.S.","We're pleased to report that our integration of BMEYE is going smoothly and the incorporation of its noninvasive monitoring technology into our EV1000 platform is on track. While this technology has long term potential, sales were negligible in the fourth quarter and will remain moderate until 2014 when we introduce the integrated platform.","We are pleased to announce that our GlucoClear system has a CE mark. While we don't expect significant sales this year, we expect 2013 to be a pivotal year as we complete additional accuracy studies in Europe and obtain greater clarity on the pathway toward U.S. approval. We remain enthusiastic about the significant breakout opportunity represented by this technology.","Total reported vascular sales, which are comprised primarily of our Fogarty products, were $14 million this quarter, up slightly from the prior year. For 2013, we continue to expect full year underlying sales growth in Critical Care product group of 4% to 6%, driven primarily by continued growth in our advanced monitoring products.","And now I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Abate","Thank you, Mike. Before I get into the financial results, I would like to explain how we accounted for the retroactive portion of the federal R&D tax credit that was passed in January. For comparison purposes, we reflected the benefit in the fourth quarter 2012. Specifically in our non-GAAP results for the quarter, we included an $8.4 million tax benefit equaling $0.07 per share, which represents the full-year 2012 credit.","As required, we will record the benefit in our first quarter 2013 GAAP results, but we'll exclude it from non-GAAP results. This, combined with the $9 million realignment charge that Mike mentioned, reduced the GAAP earnings per share by $0.13.","Turning to our results, while we fell short of our original goals for the year, we still achieved 16% underlying sales growth and recorded strong bottom line growth even as we increased our R&D investment to 18%. For the quarter, we achieved diluted EPS of $0.77 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.90, a 45% growth rate over last year.","For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 75.4% compared to 72.2% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven primarily by a more profitable product mix and a favorable impact from foreign exchange. For 2013, we expect our gross profit margin to benefit from a more favorable product mix. However, at today's exchange rates, we do not expect the FX lift we experienced in the second half of 2012.","We continue to expect full-year gross profit, excluding special items, to be between 74% and 76%.","Fourth quarter SG&A expenses of $178 million or 35% of sales benefited from disciplined spending and lower sales-related incentive expenses. Fourth quarter expenses increased $14 million over the prior-year driven primarily by U.S. transcatheter launch-related investments. We continue to expect SG&A expenses to be between 36% and 37% of sales for the full year 2013, including the impact of the medical device tax.","R&D investments in the quarter grew 23% to $75 million or 15% of sales. This increase was the result of additional investments in clinical studies and new product development efforts in all of our product lines. For the full year 2013, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be between 14% and 16%.","Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.5%. Adjusting for the global realignment charge and the benefit from the R&D tax credit renewal, our rate was 19%. Excluding the benefit of the R&D, 2012 R&D credit, we continue to expect our 2013 tax rate to be between 23% and 24%.","FX rates negatively impacted fourth quarter sales by approximately $9 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our recent guidance, FX did not have a material impact on the quarter's earnings. Looking forward, at current rates, we now expect a $20 million negative impact to 2013 full-year sales when compared to 2012 rates.","Free cash flow generated during the fourth quarter was $71 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $127 million, less capital spending of $56 million. This resulted in full year free cash flow of $253 million, which is our strongest performance to date.","During the quarter, we spent approximately $187 million on share repurchases. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares for $353 million. For modeling purposes, we now project diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 117 million in 2013.","Turning to our balance sheet, we had total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $521 million, and total debt of $189 million. Our DSO at the end of the quarter was 58 days, a reduction of 6 days from the prior quarter, driven primarily from improvements in Europe. Inventory turns were 1.8.","Turning to our 2013 sales guidance. Our product line sales guidance remains unchanged from our December Investor Conference. For Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, we expect sales to be between $800 million and $840 million. In transcatheter heart valves, we expect sales to be between $710 million and $790 million. In Critical Care, we expect sales of $560 million to $600 million. We continue to expect full-year sales of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion excluding special items. We also remain comfortable with our previously stated guidance of free cash flow between $300 million and $340 million, and earnings per diluted share of $3.21 to $3.31.","For the first quarter 2013, we project total sales of $505 million to $530 million, and expect first quarter diluted EPS, excluding the $0.07 benefit from the 2012 R&D tax credit and other special items to be $0.74 to $0.78.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks, Tom. We expect another exciting year for Edwards Lifesciences with continued strong sales growth, greater operating leverage and progress on a number of important clinical milestones. We also plan to continue investing substantially in the development of transcatheter valves and other structural heart disease therapies, as well as in Critical Care technologies. We believe our patient-focused innovation strategy, global presence and strong financial footing uniquely positions us for a sustainable competitive advantage.","With that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David Erickson","Thank you, Mike. In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Let me start with a question on the U.S. launch. $16 million in stocking in Q4. Mike, in the last call, you said you expected a few million dollars in stocking. So am I thinking about this right? If you had come in, and stocked just a few million dollars, you would have fallen below the 2 30 to 2 40 in your U.S. SAPIEN guidance? Is that fair or am I doing the math right? And maybe you can talk a little bit about the difference in the stocking versus your expectations?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, the stocking clearly was more than we expected, Larry, and I think we thought it was going to be a lower number. And so, yes, you're right. There is a real impact here that the $16 million of stocking lifted us. But I think you need to look at a little bit of a broader picture here. We -- there was such a rush for trans -- to be trained on transapical that we trained an awful lot of accounts more than we expected to train in the quarter. And with that came the stocking orders. At the same time, there was a pretty tremendous queue of transapical patients that have been collected by hospitals. And these are patients that could not have been treated with the transfemoral system. And in particular here with the SAPIEN valve and its large delivery profile it probably exasperated that number. And so what we believe happened here is kind of a triaging effect, where there was a real rush to be able to treat these transapical patients and part of that drove more training, more transapical training, than we anticipated. And probably held down some of the transfemoral numbers in the quarter. We heard, at least anecdotally, that a number of our talents, for example, only have 1 day a week that were dedicated to the TAVR procedure. And so those -- for the fourth quarter, in many cases, were exclusively transapical procedures. Hopefully that helps.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That helps. And let me use my second question on PARTNER II B at ACC. Maybe if you can talk about your expectations a little bit based on maybe some of the registry data we've seen from Europe. Will we see any of the nested registries also at ACC? And just lastly, do you expect a panel for XT?","Michael A. Mussallem","Okay. Let me see if I can get them. Well, first of all, Larry, in terms of what we expect to see out of ACC, we really don't have any insight to share on that one. You know how we feel about the SAPIEN XT valve. We think it's -- that, that's very good therapy. But no real heads-up here in terms of what they expect to see out of that trial. Your second question, Larry, I just want to make sure...","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Those nested registries, Mike, in the -- any nested registries? And just lastly...","Michael A. Mussallem","No, I don't expect to have anything published on the nested registry -- anything is possible, Larry, but I'm not expecting that. And finally, you asked about whether we thought there would be a panel on PARTNER II...","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","XT.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, on XT? Yes, we think it's probably unlikely. When we gave you estimates on what to expect, we said that we would have a submission of the PARTNER II Cohort B by midyear and there would be about a 365-day review process. Again, that's just an estimate on our part. That would be our estimate of how this thing would go and it anticipates that there -- it's unlikely there's a panel. But FDA really hasn't weighed in on that, so we don't know. We would say, it'd be very likely that there would be a panel on PARTNER II A since that's a different group of patients.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, next year, your guidance is, in the U.S., is $390 million to $440 million. And if I heard you right, it sounds like it's going to be kind of a clean number, devoid of stocking and probably not heavily influenced by clinical trials. In your minds eye, where do you think that -- what do you think that would represent in terms of penetration of the PARTNER I opportunity, at least in the shorter-term before you could maybe recruit people who are not referred today?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Bruce. Well, probably 2 very different points here. One is that in the $390 million to $440 million, those are reported results and so we would indeed see a little bit of lift from clinical units, particularly in the first half of the year while we're still finishing up PARTNER II, and then, actually, stocking is going to go from being a little lift in the first half to being a drag in the back half. And it's probably actually a drag on reported sales for the year in total. At least that's the way we've modeled it. We never know exactly how this is going to turn out. And so that's what's in the number. In terms of how deeply will we penetrate, we think there's an awful lot of patients out there, Bruce, that are not treated. Whatever kind of results we would have in 2013, we think doesn't come close to even getting after the potential population.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, as you think about the first quarter for 2013, U.S. SAPIEN sales, do we get another $14 million or $16 million in stocking or will that trend a little bit lower? And then how should we be thinking about the overall U.S. SAPIEN sales for the first quarter? Should we be thinking $90 million to $100 million? And then I have a follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem","Okay. Well, first of all, it probably wouldn't be surprising to see clinical sales be similar but probably stocking is going to be a little bit less. We'll still have stocking but -- and it'll be certainly helpful. It'll be the biggest positive of the year will come in the first quarter. I'm not sure that we have a first quarter estimate.","Thomas M. Abate","I would put it in the range of, say, 10 to 15, less than we saw in Q4. But that's not as solid to be able to predict that.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then the other reason I was talking about a bigger 1Q number, it just seems like 1Q and 2Q will be a little bit stronger than the back end of the year, because you got all that stocking lift, or is the back end going to be significantly stronger as we get a hell of a lot more commercial sales?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. So clearly, during the year, the actual number of procedures, we expect to step up. And that will be -- that will be increasing throughout the year. It's this net stocking impact that we're trying to provide some guidance on. Net stocking is a lift in Q1, that will be the biggest lift of the year. Not so much in Q2. It's hard for us to estimate, but it may or may not be a lift. In the back half, we're pretty convinced that consignment is going to be bigger than stocking. It will actually pull down reported results even though procedures are going up.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's actually great color. And then just -- one thing, one question on the EPS guidance, you just really had a strong fourth quarter here, where you beat consensus by $0.12, $0.13. Where is the spend going to be in 2013 that holds you back from raising EPS guidance?","Thomas M. Abate","Well, you know, Glen, if you look at our history, Q4 is typically, on an EPS basis, our strongest quarter. So to take and draw parallels from there is a little bit -- you've got to be careful. We are going to continue to invest in the business in absolute dollars, that's for sure. And we also have the medical device tax. If you remember, one of the things that's going to step us up, I think I said, was about 90 basis points. So we'll probably have a percentage point or close to that. For that and we also have a Japan investment that we're putting in, that's probably another 50 to 60 basis points. So if you're looking particularly at SG&A, there's some of the comparisons. And we're also -- we were very disciplined on our spending in Q4. So I think that the quarter was strong, no doubt it was strong and obviously, the R&D tax credit was all loaded in that quarter. But if you peel it back, I think the guidance still makes a lot of sense and still shows nice growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just to follow-up on Glenn's question, and just to make sure we're clear. So, despite the 4Q upside, do you think that the range you gave 1.5 months ago at the Analyst Meeting is still the right range for 2013?","Thomas M. Abate","Correct.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Maybe to clarify a couple of items just from your prepared remarks, how many centers did you end 2012 with in the U.S. in planning SAPIEN?","Michael A. Mussallem","There was approximately 200 centers, Mike, and that includes the PARTNER centers.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And help us -- one of the challenges we've had on the modeling side is to think about the impact of these nested registries you had, which are obviously opening up some different patient populations that you can treat, otherwise. Can you just share with us your plans for additional registries in 2013, just so we can get some sense of some additional opportunity for the company?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. I don't think that we have anything to report at this, Mike, in terms of additional nested registries. I mean, there may turn out to be other items that we'd study and we'll fill you in as those become apparent. But at this point, I would say, the nested registries we already have are probably pretty well enrolled. There are probably still a few patients enrolled in some of these, but they're mostly in -- and there's nothing. This is really up to FDA, if we would get additional nested registries.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Then last one. Mike, just any thoughts on just the pickup in the underlying surgical heart valve business? You sound like most of that was coming from emerging markets, but you did see some incremental strength in both the U.S. and Europe, relative to the prior few quarters. Any insights there?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, the U.S., indeed, did step up. Some of that just maybe that the market grew a little bit faster, some of it may be a diminishing impact from competition. We think those are probably the primary factors. Outside the U.S -- so we saw some particular strength -- well, both Japan was valuable and grew for us and also emerging markets were drivers. And so, overall, those were both a little stronger than they have been earlier in the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just clarify something on the guidance ranges, Tom, and maybe you can just remind us on currency. Because there's actually quite a number of moving parts since you last reported. The Japanese yen has been on a tear, the euro has also strengthened a little bit. Can you just maybe remind us about how FX flows through your P&L and any considerations that we should have on the impact of currency movement since you last spoke to us?","Thomas M. Abate","Sure, David. When we looked at it, interestingly enough, they tend to offset just maybe the way they were balanced between regions and businesses. I didn't see a significant change. Maybe 10 basis points overall for us on any line. So did not see that as a big factor. Obviously, sales are directly affected and what we have is we have our hedged contracts, which are designed to offset those movements and those are generally in cost of goods sold. The rest of it is expenses, operational expenses, that are in the foreign currencies, and we hope that a combination between the hedge and the natural hedges, the hedges we buy and the natural hedges, end up getting us covered to, say, approximately about 90% of the risk.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe, Mike, strategically, you obviously brought back some stock this quarter, there is naturally some dislocation in October around the Q3 results. But maybe you could just help us think about what you're going to do with the cash balance as it continues to grow and maybe comment on how -- share repurchases, is this the type of thing we should think of that you'll do selectively as there are outside moves in the stock to the downside or is it something more consistent that we can expect going forward?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I think it's fair to say, David, that we're more aggressive purchasers of the stock when we think there are opportunities there. And so we do moderate our buying patterns based on price. Overall, we continue to like share repurchases only in the absence of where we see really good strategic investments. If we found something close to home in -- whether it's in structural heart disease or in Critical Care technologies that we thought will really spell growth for the company in the future, that would be our first call on cash. We don't have anything to talk about at this point. But in the absence of that we would selectively do share repurchase.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe lastly, back on the margin side. Tom, I know you talked about the impact of FX on the gross margin not having as pronounced an impact as it did in the second half of the year. But how should we think about the underlying change in the gross profit margin? Just sort of isolate the mix impact from transcatheter valves here, but it was a pretty big year-over-year improvement, but I assume that the second half of '11 was a little bit depressed due to FX. So if you just really got the drivers of the year-over-year change in gross margin, how would you help us distill an underlying gross profit move?","Thomas M. Abate","Sure. It was clearly in year '11, we had a pretty negative impact from foreign exchange. So a good portion of the boost was what would happen at '11. And as a full year, David, probably the best way to think of it is, we said, it still remained to be the case as we said back in Investor Conference, probably the full-year rate of 74.4%,has maybe 50, 60 basis points of help. So the underlying rate, I'd put it just under 74%. And our guidance for next year, being 74% to 76% implies, we'll probably get 100 to 120 product mix is the way it looks right now. And the vast majority of that would come from the growth of transcatheter. Just [indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mike, I was wondering if you could just maybe shed a little bit more details on the global realignment, what exactly you're doing differently in light of the environment.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Kristen. What we routinely do is take a look at our portfolio. We take a look at the products that we're selling. We take a look at where we're making the products and so forth. And where the growth is going to be in the future. And when we make our additions, whether they're in R&D or SG&A, we really try to move resources to where the opportunities are. And in many cases, that means we move it away from other opportunities. And so, particularly in this case, our biggest expense item is obviously employees. So we had just under 100 employees that, actually, we didn't have jobs for going forward. We tried to handle them with a great deal of respect. And they moved out of the company and that's what drove the charge that you saw this quarter. We're fortunate still to be a growing company. I think we added in that same quarter probably more than 200 jobs for a net increase of more than 100 jobs because of the opportunities that Edwards have, but that was the nature of the realignment.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Which businesses were those employees coming from?","Michael A. Mussallem","It was a mixture of some of our core businesses, both Critical Care and Surgical Heart Valves.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And can you just comment maybe on the environment in Europe, I know with transcatheter valve you talked about pricing being a little bit under pressure, I think you mentioned volume discounts? But maybe if you could just shed a little bit more light on that and just how you feel about pricing going forward in 2013 now that we have a couple of new competitors on the market.","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure. Yes, we're fortunate that we're a market leader and so we try not to have our pricing driven by some new competitor and we've got a very strong market position. So we're quite disciplined on that. Having said that, for our big customers that achieved substantial volumes, we give them discounts. And also, we find in some cases that we have more growth in countries that have more attractive pricing. The combination of that probably had a 2% to 3% impact year-over-year in 2012 versus 2011.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just kind of what are your expectations for growth next year, or I guess, 2013, are you still anticipating kind of high single-digit or 10% growth in Europe?","Michael A. Mussallem","In Europe, yes. We feel pretty much the same as we spoke about it at the Investor Conference, Kristen, which is we think the market may grow around 10% for the year, and we think we might grow some maybe at 1\/2 that rate because of that new competition that's coming.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'm just wondering if I could follow-up a little bit on that last question. In your remarks, I think you commented that you're still not seeing much in terms of impact from competition in Europe, but I think you also noted that your TA business was down in Europe. So I guess I'm curious what gives you confidence at this point that it's not competition that's impacting that business.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, it's a good question. Our competition tends to be pretty concentrated in, I think primarily in Germany. We saw a tremendous growth in our transfemoral business, actually about 35% growth in transfemoral on a year-over-year basis. And so net-net, we feel pretty good about actually what's going on from an overall share perspective. We -- just because we're out there and we're in these accounts, we think we have a pretty good handle on what the competition is introducing and our sense is they're just not very big numbers.","Thomas M. Abate","Primarily, transfemoral-first, then we hear more of that.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, the bigger impact that we really hear with the phenomena that's happening out there is there's more of a transfemoral-first approach is what's causing the transfemoral numbers to go up and transapical to go down.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just one follow-up. The TA training number in the U.S. I think you noted that there was 150 centers that were TA trained. I think you've commented in the past that there was a stocking requirement of 8 valves for every center that got trained on the TA approach and understanding there were some of those that were PARTNER sites, it would still suggest a stocking number that would be even above the number you guys did in the quarter. And so I'm just -- I understand also there's some consignment offsetting that. But was there some mistake in that calculation in terms of what the requirements were for TA trained sites?","Michael A. Mussallem","No, Raj. You're circling around it pretty well. The bulk of that $16 million of stocking was really probably net that resulted in transapical. And you're right, transapical probably got pulled down little bit by some consignment and the transfemoral in the quarter, although it got a lift from stocking, also we had the beginning of some significant movement to consignment as well. So the bulk of that $16 million is really transapical stocking. But as you correctly point out, consignment does detract from that.","Thomas M. Abate","But Raj, if you're working with the math, you also have to remember, one of the things we said is that some of the larger centers came in for TA that if they were close to earning consignment that we probably would -- we would not go through with the second stocking order that they would go straight into consignment. So it's smaller than you would think. If you try to match that up to the number of centers, it's quite a bit less. And that's a big piece of the story. There's quite a few of those guys that came in first. We did not book a stocking order.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then it all sounds like with the 200 centers in total at the end of the year that perhaps the training rate on new centers may have slowed a little bit as you started training more TA centers?","Michael A. Mussallem","Well, yes, as you can imagine, Raj, training the number of TA centers really consumed tremendous amount of capacity. We were some very busy folks during the fourth quarter training people in the transapical approach.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Swann.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I was hoping that maybe you could give some more color on TA versus TF in the U.S. in the quarter. Just -- you mentioned in response to a question earlier that the high level of TA activity could have pressured TF. I'm just wondering if you could give us some direction there and maybe quantify that a little bit. Now I assume you feel like you've worked through the bolus now and we've returned to sort of normal activity going forward from here on out.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, good question, Danielle. Yes. What we said is from a pure sales perspective, about 45% of what was sold in the U.S. in the quarter was transapical. Because there was quite a bit of stocking, actually that number was probably from a procedure point of view, that probably accounted for more like 25% to 30% of the actual procedures may have been transapical. And although we don't have accurate data on how much of the bolus we worked off, we believe that a large part of the bolus probably was worked off during the quarter. But again, this is  one of these determinations that's made by the Heart team and so there's other factors involved, often it's the strength of the surgical program or the Cardiology program that will drive it one way or the other.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on that. Are you seeing, especially at the higher volume centers, are you seeing any change in activity on their end or in the infrastructure, I guess I should say, on their end adding -- the docs at your Analyst meeting mentioned they were working to hire more surgeons. What are you seeing out there as far as that goes, to sort of handle the higher volume of patients now that you have TA approved and [indiscernible]","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, it's a good question, Danielle. We hear anecdotally that there is some movement in the large centers to add a second team, for example. But it's difficult for us to generalize. I think, broadly, we'd say the increases that we're seeing right now are coming from new centers as opposed to additions in the existing big centers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Cannacord Genuity.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Back to TAVI in the U.S. Real quick, just trying to calibrate our models entering 2013 here a little bit better. And I apologize if I just haven't got it yet. But if you sort of equalize for your comments on stocking both in the fourth quarter and your thoughts for the first half of the year. It looks like from a procedural standpoint, there needs to be an uptick in growth sequentially. That's fairly meaningful, 30%, 40%. Assuming, let's say, a linear sales figure to the midpoint of your U.S. guidance for the year, because you've got the drag on -- with stocking in the second half. If we just sort of arbitrarily assume a linear amount of $100 million or $110 million, you kind of get to that number. So it assumes a fairly significant ramp in procedural volume, actually, implant rates Q4 to Q1. Can you help us out, sort of quantitatively, as to whether or not I'm in the right ballpark there in terms of what we need to see?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Well, we do expect it to be a ramp, Jason, that's for sure. We expect to see a little of our seasonality, of course, in the third quarter but overall, a ramp throughout the year. I'm not sure I've run specific numbers on sequential quarter-over-quarters but there must be more of a doubling of procedures from 2012 to 2013. There's just a lot more procedures in the year as this launch progresses.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly for me, you saw it a little bit in Europe when TAVI was launched in the subsequent couple of years with respect to the Halo effect on your surgical valve platform. In this quarter, that part of your business was just a tad bit better than what we expected. Are we starting to see a similar Halo effect as we see higher number of severe symptomatic aortic valve patients entering the queue, some of whom, unfortunately, not TAVI candidates ending up on the table with a cardiac surgeon, are you starting to see the benefit of that early?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, we look for that, Jason. We can't say at this point that we've really seen the uptick in the surgical business as a result of transfemoral. Part of the theory that we have is this is more likely to track really the advent of transapical cases. And that, as you know, just started here late in October. And so as that starts to become part of their practice, we think it's more likely to see this kind of Halo show up, and we'll be looking closely for it and be glad to share that with you.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Lastly, real quick, transaortic. Anecdotally, the TA number was strong even from a procedure standpoint. Do you have any evidence that transaortic is catching on here in the U.S.? And then what's the update on evident -- reimbursement for evidence development there?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Clearly, there's interest in transaortic. And we're seeing it across Europe as well, and certainly in the U.S. Right now, the NCD does not provide for the reimbursement of a transaortic delivery and, so, that probably has a very real impact on how often it's done. We actually thought that this special protocol that would be approved by CMS would be done at this point. It's still not quite done. It's at the final throes. I think the societies that are actually running these registries decided to take it through FDA first and to have an approved protocol and an approved ID, and they pretty much cleared that hurdle. And so now we think there's just the final hurdle to get through CMS. So that should be around the corner for us. And at that time, we'll get a better handle on TAL.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.","Adam Darity","This is actually Adam in for Amit. I don't want to go back Europe TAVI for a question. I just -- talk about the reimbursement landscape there and any significant changes you've seen in the quarter, expectations of new reimbursements to come online in the first quarter?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, not a substantial change in reimbursement during the quarter. We did see probably a little uptick in France in terms of the number of centers, but no real -- no real change, for example, we've been anticipating some improvements in the U.K. No real changes yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","It's actually Miroslava for Rick today.  If I could go back to the U.S. volumes, it sounds like you're anticipating quite a dramatic uptick in 2013. But TA volumes, if the bolus is already done, those should be leveling off. Maybe help us think through what are the drivers behind the acceleration. I appreciate there is another probably 100 centers or so coming online, but those would probably not be the higher volume sites. What drives your confidence that you see volumes accelerating to that extent in 2012 -- '13, I'm sorry.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Well, broadly, we think a lot of centers are just getting going, Miro. So we think there's going to be a substantial lift in 2013 and given that it's only the real second full year of launch, we don't think it's unusual to have this kind of a growth rate. As it relates to TA, that, that gets to be a little bit tricky business. I'm not sure of your question exactly but it's tough to know exactly what the TA percentages are going to do. Remember, this is the SAPIEN technology, and we, historically, saw higher TA percentages with SAPIEN because of a larger profile during introduction and that drifts down. And at the same time, you've got this under current of a TF-first approach. So we're not certain exactly where that goes. But in terms of the -- what's going to happen to the 2013 numbers, we just think the underlying demand is substantial across-the-board and that these Heart teams are going to continue to be treated, they gain their confidence -- as we say, there's 200 centers that are trained as we exited the year.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Maybe secondarily, as competitors trials ramp up and as more competitors start their trials, actually both in Europe and in the U.S. in the second half of the year, have you accounted for that in your guidance?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. We think we have. We factored that in to some extent. If it turns out to be unusual, then we would be affected by it but we believe that, that's in our numbers and we certainly model that.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And my final one is on mitral. Any color as to when we might see anything from your mitral program, like a first demand experience, or any details on the device?","Michael A. Mussallem","You can be certain that as soon as we have something meaningful to announce that we'll get it out there. No real change to what we said at our Investor Conference, which is we thought that our first demand was likely in 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. Tom, by my calculation, fourth quarter gross margin excluding currency was probably somewhere in the 74.5 or greater range. Is that roughly correct?","Thomas M. Abate","Actually, the boost from currency in -- specifically in the fourth quarter was bigger than that, Bob. Its probably closer to 200 basis points.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then back on the number of centers, I think at the Analyst Day, Mike, you said that you thought you might train 100 or greater centers in 2013. Is that still a good number for U.S. centers to be trained in 2013?","Michael A. Mussallem","We think that's a reasonable number, Bob, yes. We said 200 in total over 2 years, and most likely that it will split pretty evenly.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then you got a lot of questions on the call about the stocking disclosures that you make and the trial revenues. And I was just wondering if, for the sake of simplicity, you might be willing to give us, for the full year 2013, what you think the combined stocking plus trial, clinical trial revenue, might be for you guys in the United States?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, if we could predict that with a great deal of precision, we'd probably try and get it out there, Bob. It's difficult -- that's a difficult one for us to predict accurately. So we more or less just try and share what we think is going to happen from a trend and direction point of view.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, Mike, there's a bunch of questions about Europe but I'm not sure if anyone really got your views on what you saw in the fourth quarter in Europe specifically. I mean, did it feel like the market got better? Because obviously, over the course of 2012, things fell off pretty rapidly from Q2 to Q1 and Q3, Q2. But did you see -- just some comments on Europe generally in Q4, obviously, the numbers, the growth rates a little bit better. And is that market -- how did that feel in the fourth quarter?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I think we've talked pretty extensively about TF and TA. Maybe from a country mix point of view, we saw Germany continue to be a strong grower. You're talking about -- depending on whether you're talking about procedures, sales, some in the 10% to 20% range. And France helped a little bit, too. I think the biggest difference is we didn't have as big a decline in the fourth quarter out of Southern Europe as we had seen a little bit earlier. They were negative but not nearly as negative as they have been previously. I think it was maybe literally single-digit declines for the first time that we haven't seen for a while.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's Steve Beuchaw here for David.  I wanted to ask about Europe, first of all from a different direction and still on transcatheter valves. I mean, Mike, I wonder if you could spend a few minutes giving us a sense on what you're seeing there on the clinical environment with some of the data that we've seen like the GARY and the PRAGMATIC registries and now we have a new set of valve guidelines. Given the data that we have there, in 2013, can we be spending a little bit more time talking about the differences in clinical outcomes between SAPIEN and other products? And should we be thinking, given the data that we have, about expanding the use of transcatheter valves and relative to surgery just on the basis of that data?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, well, you're absolutely correct, Steve. There's going to be a lot more data that becomes apparent because of these registries. The SAPIEN platform already has a tremendous amount of data. And we feel like it's a best-in-class system. We haven't spent a lot of time trying to differentiate ourselves versus our competitors. We spent far more time trying to make sure that these patients that have been untreated get treated and feel like we've made some headway there. Is there some chance here that patients that aren't as sick get treated, I suppose there could be some lift, but we think the more fundamental lift will come actually when the PARTNER II data that measures these -- that evaluates these patients with STS scores down to 4 becomes available.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then I wanted to follow-up on a question that was asked earlier on surgical valves some of the strengths there, this Halo effect concept. We saw good numbers in cardiac surgeries, vascular picked up a little bit more than we might have expected. Is it possible that there are other fluid dynamics there? Maybe tenders? Maybe getting into new centers more broadly? And, lastly, could there be maybe any selling day issues that you would point to?","Michael A. Mussallem","So say it again, you're talking about what would be the reason for the lift in surgical valves in the fourth quarter, is that what you're asking?","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Really, outside of surgical valves. Cardiac surgery, strong; vascular, pretty strong, that suggests there might be something more broad than the Halo effect in the thoracic surgery suite.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Well, I think -- when it comes to sales data, I think there is -- there was an extra sale day in the U.S. and that may be the case outside the U.S. as well. When it's not really profound, we normally don't talk about it. But I think that clearly was the case. It's very difficult for us to say with 1 quarter of data what's happening in the environment. I'd love to say something in general about the market but it's too soon.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Nam with Janney Capital.","Spencer Nam - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","First question is on the cost of TAVI program and potential impact of this on centers signing up for the program. You guys still sound like there's a pent-up demand with the centers trying to join the TAVI program here. But whether -- I'm curious whether you guys are feeling any sort of pushback from some of the centers out there because of the economics potentially impacting, making this more of a broad-based program for these centers.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. I think it's certainly true that some of the new centers are challenged from an economic perspective. Probably the best data on this was the PARTNER data, and that showed that it was cost effective. But nonetheless, we know that it certainly is more profitable for some of large academic centers in the East versus what it might be in some of the smaller centers or those in more rural areas. So that is the comment. I mean, broadly though, when we think about cost-effectiveness, the more that the procedure gets refined and the more we're able to reduce complications and get people out of the hospital faster, we feel like that is improving everyday, that really improves the economics. And so although there is some consternation on the part of some of the new accounts, we think the trend is going in the right direction. And we feel pretty good about the cost-effectiveness of the technology overall.","Spencer Nam - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Are you guys sharing some data with the hospitals -- new hospitals, when you have these discussions on the lowering trends of average day of stay or the lowering cost of procedure costs associated with improved -- increasing number of patients and so forth? I mean, are these data points being shared or kind of -- how does the discussion play out here?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. As part of their training, we have a lot of open discussion. And we certainly try and support them as they think about starting their program. We share the available data that's available and the total impact that it might have on the hospital. And so, they come with a number of their own questions and we try and be as helpful as possible.","Spencer Nam - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Can I just put in a one quick question, on the XT approval timeline, if the panel is not going to happen, why would you guys feel that it may take more than 6, 7 months for approval?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, you sounds exactly like what we say to FDA. Of course, we will ask for a faster approval timelines. You guys know the history of this. We probably don't have much better estimate than you may have. We feel like this estimate of 365 days is certainly faster than the averages that FDA typically has in this space. And so that's more than 500 days. So we're going to stay with our estimate at this point, Spencer, though.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Michael A. Mussallem","Okay. Well, thanks for your continued interest in Edwards.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","I would now like to turn the conference over to David Erickson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please begin.","David Erickson","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our first quarter 2018 financial results. During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and the accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A. ","Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Scott Ullem, CFO. ","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance, expectations for clinical trials and the timing and impact of new product approvals, competitive matters, litigation, therapy adoption and foreign currency fluctuations.

Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release and on our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael Mussallem","Thank you, David. We're pleased with our start to 2018, with first quarter total adjusted sales of $938 million, consistent with our expectations. This represents 9% underlying growth and positions us for 10% to 11% underlying sales growth this year. Therapy adoption of transcatheter heart valves once again drove the majority of growth, aided by solid performance in our other product lines. ","Adjusted EPS grew 30% even while investing aggressively and making significant progress in our Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies, and as we continue to build capabilities and advance clinical trials across our portfolio of replacement and repair technologies. Most importantly, even more patients are benefiting from our lifesaving technologies than ever before. ","Turning to Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy. We're announcing 2 new developments in our TAVR U.S. clinical trials and will discuss those in a moment. In the quarter, consistent with our expectations, adjusted gross sales were $560 million, up 12% on an underlying basis over the prior year. This growth rate includes the final quarter of adjustments for stocking inventory in Germany, which began a year ago. Growth was driven by continued strong therapy adoption, and our global average selling price remained stable. ","In the U.S., transcatheter heart valve procedures for the first quarter grew in the mid-teens versus prior year. We believe overall U.S. procedure growth was roughly in line with our growth. Strong therapy adoption continue to fuel procedure growth broadly across our network of hospitals, and our SAPIEN 3 valve has continued it's best-in-class clinical performance. ","Growth was particularly strong in lower volume centers, where this therapy is increasingly accessible to a broader population of aortic stenosis patients. Based on our continued research, we are increasingly confident there are many patients who would benefit from TAVR and are not diagnosed or treated today. We are increasing our efforts to communicate with physicians to help them properly identify patients and assist them with navigating the care pathway.","Outside the U.S., our procedure growth rate was in the low double digits. We continue to see excellent long-term potential for growth, and we believe TAVR therapy penetration is still relatively low. Procedure growth in Europe was double digits this quarter while our growth was lower due to a year-over-year shift in share to our largest competitor. We look forward to the introduction of SAPIEN 3 Ultra and CENTERA valves to strengthen our leadership position. ","Growth in countries with lower TAVR adoption rates continued to outpace countries where the therapy is more established. In Japan, our highest growth region, we continue to see strong TAVR therapy adoption with a few new centers being added. We believe Edwards procedure growth in the first quarter was in line with the overall procedure growth in that geography where aortic stenosis remains a large undertreated disease. ","As previously reported, we're conducting a small clinical trial of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra system to supplement our European regulatory submission. This was unanticipated at the start of the process and is a reflection of the evolving European regulatory climate. We expect to complete enrollment of these patients this quarter and to receive CE Mark approval of the Ultra system in the second half of 2018. And following discussions with FDA, we continue to feel confident in the U.S. approval of this system in late 2018. ","In February, we were pleased to receive CE Mark for our premium price, self-expanding CENTERA valve, which contributed a minimal amount of sales this quarter. Clinician feedback has been very positive for this innovative valve system, and we have begun a targeted introduction to strategically position this valve in specific European centers. ","Additionally, we're pleased to announce approval of a U.S. pivotal trial to study CENTERA for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis patients who are at intermediate-risk for open heart surgery. We're enthused to launch this rigorous study, which we believe will build an extremely robust body of evidence to support the introduction and positioning of this feature-rich, self-expanding valve system. We expect to begin enrollment in Q3 of this single-arm trial, which will study nearly 1,000 patients with a 1-year endpoint, including enrolling patients and a bicuspid sub study. Since it will be conducted in current Edwards centers, it's not likely to result in incremental sales but will increase R&D spending. ","Separately, I'm pleased to announce the U.S. approval of a limited Continued Access Protocol, or CAP, of our PARTNER III trial for low-risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Since the low-risk trial has completed enrollment, the study will allow for the ongoing treatment at selected clinical sites of a limited number of low-risk patients with a SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve. We expect the CAP program to commence in the third quarter. We continue to anticipate data from the PARTNER III trial to be presented at the ACC in March of 2019, and to receive FDA approval of a low-risk indication late that year. ","In summary, we continue to expect our THVT full year 2018 underlying sales growth rate to be at the higher end of 11% to 15%. ","Turning the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy. Adjusted sales for the first quarter of $214 million were up 2% on an underlying basis. These results exclude a sales return reserve related to a strategic change to convert to a consignment-inventory model. This will complement the introduction of our new premium products and streamline our inventory management. Scott's going to discuss this more -- in more detail in just a moment. ","Edwards new products drove underlying sales growth at a rate higher than total procedure growth. Underlying heart valve sales grew in the mid-single digits compared to a mid-single-digit decline from the smaller repair segment. ","Adoption of our INTUITY Elite valve system in the U.S. continued to be strong during the quarter, and we've seen high demand for our recently launched INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve. This valve is designed to be an attractive option for active patients, which is reflected in the trend to younger patients in our earlier experience. We continue to expect to introduce this new class of resilient tissue valves in Japan this year, pending reimbursement approval. ","Since completing our acquisition of Harpoon Medical in December last year, our integration activities have been going very well, with significant progress made to our midyear 2018 European launch. However, have we recently learned of complications with three of the 65 treated in early clinical studies. While still early, we're looking into the root cause, which may influence the timing of our commercial launch. We do not expect this to have a material impact on the 2018 surgical heart valve sales and remain optimistic about this innovative therapy to treat degenerative mitral valve regurgitation. ","In summary, in Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, we continue to expect full year 2018 underlying sales growth of 2% to 4%. ","In Critical Care, sales for the quarter were $164 million and grew 8% on an underlying basis. This performance was driven by strong growth across the portfolio, led primarily by HemoSphere and strong regional performance in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. ","HemoSphere, our next-generation all-in-one monitoring platform, continues to receive excellent feedback from clinicians and is expected to be an important growth driver in 2018 and beyond. HemoSphere is designed to provide greater clarity on a patient's hemodynamic status to enable clinicians to make timely, potentially life-saving decisions. ","During the first quarter, we are pleased to announce the regulatory approval of our Acumen Hypotension Prediction Index, or HPI, in the U.S. We plan to introduce this technology to a limited number of hospitals utilizing our current platform until it's available on HemoSphere later this year. This first-of-a-kind technology leverages predictive analytics to alert clinicians to address potential hypotension or low blood pressure before it occurs in their surgical patients. ","In summary, based on our momentum, we now expect full year 2018 underlying sales growth in Critical Care at the higher end of 6% to 8%. ","Turning to our Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid programs, or TMTT, we continue to invest aggressively in this portfolio of therapies and believe we are well positioned to address this opportunity as there are millions of patients without effective treatment options. We're encouraged by the continued progress on each of our programs, and in the quarter, treated patients with all of our TMTT repair and replacement therapies. We continue to be optimistic about each of their potential to be a valuable treatment option. Today, I will cover some select updates. ","Beginning with Transcatheter Mitral repair, we recorded sales of less than $1 million. Patients are being treated with the CE Mark-approved Cardioband, and we're encouraged by the high procedural success rates. As previously indicated, we're integrating the Cardioband supply chain into the Edwards Quality System, and inventory may be constrained throughout 2018 as we continue that process. ","We continue to expect TMTT sales to ramp throughout the year to approximately $15 million for the full year 2018. We believe that the annular reduction provided by Cardioband can be an important first-line therapy for many mitral patients. ","Enrollment in our CLASP, CE Mark trial for our PASCAL transcatheter mitral repair program remains on track, and we expect to launch this platform in 2019. We are also on track to initiate our U.S. trial later this year. ","In mitral valve replacement, we're continuing to see good clinical progress with both of our transseptal platforms, Edwards CardiAQ and SAPIEN M3. During the quarter, at the CRT meeting in Washington, D.C., promising early clinical data for M3 were presented. The early experience was encouraging and suggested the system is feasible for the treatment of patients with severe MR who are at higher risk for mitral valve surgery. ","In our tricuspid repair therapies, we're pleased to announce we completed enrollment of our Cardioband tricuspid CE Mark trial and remain on track to begin introducing this platform in Europe later this year. In the U.S., we continue to activate sites for an early feasibility study. Overall, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities to treat patients suffering from tricuspid and mitral valve disease with our transcatheter therapies. We're optimistic in achieving our significant clinical milestones in 2018 and realizing our goal of launching at least one new therapy a year in each of the next several years. And you can expect to hear more clinical updates at the upcoming EuroPCR and TVT medical meetings. ","Before I turn it over to Scott, as we previously indicated, Boston Scientific initiated litigation that involves multiple patents in multiple countries that will likely yield numerous court actions over an extended period of time. The recent developments have not changed our view that Boston's patents are invalid, and we're confident in our leading intellectual property position. And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Ullem","Thank you, Mike. We continue to see robust demand for TAVR therapy, which generated total company underlying sales growth of 9.3%. In addition to our strong sales performance, we achieved significant leverage with adjusted operating income growing 14% and adjusted earnings per share growing 30% to $1.22, aided by a reduced tax rate. ","There were two adjustments to our reported sales in the first quarter, first, this is the final quarter in which we recorded an adjustment for our German stocking sales. And second, adjusted sales excludes a $35 million sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for surgical valves in the United States. We decided to implement this model to complement the introduction of our new premium products and to streamline inventory management at hospitals. We estimate this conversion will be completed by year-end, which will result in an additional sales return reserves during the course of this year and will total an estimated $60 million to $75 million in 2018. ","We will exclude these reserves in our non-GAAP sales results and underlying growth rates. As a reminder, the Medtronic royalty, which is included in our U.S. sales, was lower this quarter. The royalty rate, reduced on January 1, per the terms of the agreement and we expect the full year 2018 royalty to be $15 million to $20 million less than it was in 2017. ","GAAP earnings per share was $0.96, which was impacted by 2 notable adjustments, a $24 million tax reserve related to the new U.S. tax law; and the surgical valve sales return reserve I just mentioned. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release, and I will provide further details on the tax reserve in a moment. ","I'll now cover the details of our first quarter results and then discuss guidance for 2018. For the quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 74.5% compared to 75.7% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven primarily by the impact from foreign exchange and some continued investments in our operations, partially offset by a more profitable product mix, led by growing sales of TAVR. We continue to expect our 2018 adjusted gross profit margin, excluding special items, to be between 74% and 76%. ","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $256 million or 28.6% of sales compared to $230 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by the strengthening of the euro against the dollar and personnel-related expenses. The ratio of SG&A as a percentage of sales would have been 130 basis points lower if you exclude the impact of the special sales adjustments. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 28% and 29% of sales for the full year 2018. ","Research and development expense in the quarter grew 11% over the prior year to $143 million or 16% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter heart valve programs, including spending on clinical trials. The ratio of research and development as a percentage of sales would have been 70 basis points lower if you exclude the impact of the special sales adjustments. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect research and development, excluding special items, to be between 16% and 17% of sales. ","Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate of 21.6% for the quarter was driven by a $24 million reserve against the tax benefit we recognized last quarter in connection with U.S. tax reform. The need for the reserve was triggered by new guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service during February. ","Excluding the impact of this reserve, and other special items, our tax rate would have been 13.2%. This was a lower rate and driven by more favorable benefit from U.S. tax reform and higher employee stock-based compensation deductions. We now expect our 2018 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 13% and 16%. ","Foreign exchange rates increased fourth quarter sales by $36 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now estimate an $80 million lift, or about 2%, to full year 2018 sales compared to the prior year. Compared to our February guidance, FX rates positively impacted earnings per share by $0.04 this quarter. ","Free cash flow generated during the first quarter was $108 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $151 million, less capital spending of $43 million. ","Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.5 billion, the majority of which was held outside the U.S. Total debt was $1.1 billion. Average shares outstanding during the first quarter, remained level with the prior quarter at 215 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2018 to be between 213 million and 215 million. ","Turning to our 2018 guidance. Given our strong start to the year, combined with the strengthening of the euro, at current exchange rates, we remain confident in achieving the higher end of each of the sales guidance ranges shared at our investor conference in December. Those ranges are, $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion for Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy; $810 million to $850 million for Surgical Heart Valve Therapy; and $610 million to $650 million for Critical Care; and for total Edwards, $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion. ","For full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share, we now expect to be between $4.50 and $4.70, up from our previous guidance of $4.43 to $4.63. This improvement was driven by a lower projected tax rate, partially offset by increased investments from our tax savings to accelerate growth initiatives, consistent with our strategy. ","Lastly, we continue to expect full year 2018 free cash flow to be at the higher end of our original guidance range of $700 million to $775 million. ","For the second quarter of 2018, at current foreign exchange rates, we project total sales to be between $950 million and $1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.15, excluding special items. And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael Mussallem","Thanks, Scott. We're confident in our outlook for continued strong sales goal, and we remain passionate about helping more patients around the world. We continue to focus on driving organic growth with leading innovative technologies while aggressively investing in our future. Our foundation of leadership, coupled with a robust product pipeline, positions us well for continued longer-term success and greater shareholder value as we put -- as we pursue multibillion-dollar market opportunities. ","And with that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David Erickson","Thank you, Mike. We're ready to take questions now. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.","Jason Mills","Mike, can you hear me okay?","Michael Mussallem","Yes, I hear you fine, Jason.","Jason Mills","Super. Mike, maybe if we could start by talking about the U.S. TAVR market. Coming out of the fourth quarter result, it was somewhat surprising in a lot of ways, the strength, just coming couple of months after your Investor Day, in which you gave your guidance, which you reiterated today. Q4 results were stronger and you talked about some of the end-of-quarter trends that you saw, as well as strength that's sort of surprised us in the lower volume centers, which you reiterated here today. So today's result was seemingly roughly in line with your expectations. I think many of us on The Street are a little excited after your Q4 results, so a little over than ours. Maybe you can talk about the U.S. TAVR market within the context of what you saw coming out of Q4 and what you saw during Q1? And then maybe what you might expect as the year progresses with the CAP for PARTNER III coming through, as well as the commencement of the trial for CENTERA, which you announced today?","Michael Mussallem","Okay. Let me try and recap that, Jason. There's quite a few little pieces in there. But bigger picture, the THV growth globally of 12.4% was something that was very consistent with our overall expectation. The U.S. was very consistent with our expectation as well. And as I mentioned, we continue to expect to be at the high end of 11% to 15% for the full year. Now a couple of things that people may not have remembered or not taken account for, the Medtronic royalty changed at the start of the year per the contract, and so that's expected to be $15 million to $20 million less that affected the first quarter. And first quarter a year ago, you might have considered a tough comp. There's -- the seasonality is always difficult for us. Quarters vary from one to another. The fourth quarter was quite strong, whereas the first quarter probably have some impact with Easter in it. So there may have a little bit of an atypical seasonality pattern. But by and large, we felt that these results were consistent with what we expected.","Jason Mills","I'll follow up, sticking with the U.S., I guess, maybe give us an update on the number of centers that you have in the United States. And you talked last quarter about the lower volume centers, and clearly, over the last call it 18 months, there's been -- and there've been more centers added with respect to the TAVR program than many of us expected it. How do you see that trending going forward? And I guess just as a follow-up to your comments about the PIII CAP, how much of an impact do you think that, that will have? I guess, the question is more with respect to any inkling you have about pent-up demand within that low-risk cohort ahead of a late 2019 approval?","Michael Mussallem","Okay, thanks. While, I think last time we reported, it was around 575 centers. So we add sites as they qualify, and I think that typically turns out to be 20 to 40 over that period of time. The thing that we found interesting is it seems to bring new patients into the system. Maybe it's because patients are in their own networks, and when we add a hospital, even though it might be a smaller one, that it opens that up, so we continue to see that trend. As it relates to the CAP program, FDA wanted to give sites the ability to continue to process patients that were already in their queue, but it wasn't -- it's not an unlimited CAP program. As a matter of fact, it is quite limited by site, by over a certain period of time. Even if we max that out this year, it would contribute less than 1% to our sales growth. So it's helpful, but kind of minor in the total scale of things.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Mike, just a question from me on the U.S. and a follow-up on international, if I could. So Mike, you're confident of 11% to 15%, you mentioned it several times in this call. To get from the 12% to the upper end of 11% to 15%, can you just kind of talk to us as you progress through the balance of the year, your confidence in that. I mean the comps do get easier, you have some incremental product launches, there's some seasonality, but how do we get from the 12% to the upper end of the 11% to 15% across the quarters?","Michael Mussallem","Well, thanks, David. I think you just answered the question. Those are exactly the points. The comps in the second half of the year certainly aren't equivalent to the comps that exist in the first half. We are in the process of launching CENTERA and we'll have -- hopefully, have Ultra here towards the end of the year, so those will be helpful. And we just generally have momentum. We continue to believe that we have the most competitive product line and that we've got a real growing marketplace. The more we study this marketplace, the more we believe and have confidence in the fact that there are many untreated patients.","David Lewis","Okay. Maybe I'll ask you more complicated questions about the x U.S. markets that I won't answer, but two-part question, Mike, for x U.S. One, you talked about shared dynamics x U.S., can you just talk about the shared dynamics you referred to. Was that product positioning, pricing? And kind of related, as we think about the IP dispute with Boston, as you mentioned, are you planning any inventory stocking in the second quarter in anticipation of disruption? And as you think about the Ultra skirt you also mentioned, do you see that it's differentiated from S3 from an IP perspective? And I'll stop at that.","Michael Mussallem","There's quite a few little questions in there. Let's see if I get to them, David. First of all, I think you asked about the share shift that we said we had a share shift that occurred to our largest competitor. You know that Edwards sells at a significant price premium to competitors. And what we feel like has happened is there was a 2- to 3-point share point difference from year-over-year to our largest competitor. We think actually it's been pretty stable quarter-over-quarter. We look forward to getting the SAPIEN 3 Ultra and the CENTERA valves to strengthen our leadership positions. When -- Ultra is different, probably from an IP perspective, we don't feel like SAPIEN 3 infringes. We think it's even probably a bigger stretch for Ultra. And just your other question about do we plan any stocking programs. No, we don't have any stocking programs planned at this time. We'll share those if we feel like that's the right thing to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins","I had a question for Scott, but before I got there, I wanted to ask one quick on just sort of the dynamics around the Medtronic royalty. Thank you for the $15 million to $20 million. I'm just curious, should we think about it as being sort of evenly paced throughout the year? Or is that $15 million to $20 million sort of front-end loaded here in the first quarter?","Michael Mussallem","Scott might be the best one to answer that.","Scott Ullem","Sure. It's probably a few million dollars of that $15 million to $20 million was realized in the first quarter, and the rest should be fairly evenly distributed during the rest of 2018.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. And then just a couple of questions on the earnings guidance. First, just -- can you just walk through the dynamics of the pacing of the year, why Q2 earnings is lowered in Q1? Obviously, The Street is a little bit higher than the guidance you're giving for Q2 earnings. And then maybe talk a little bit about in terms of the full year earnings guidance versus the previous guidance. Wondered if you could just quantify the impact of the tax rate, FX, the extra spending. So I guess, two questions in there, one, just understanding cadence and why Q2 is a little lower and then understanding what's changed?","Scott Ullem","Sure. Let's start with the first quarter and how it varied from our February guidance, where the midpoint of our range was $1.09. We beat that by about $0.13 on a non-GAAP basis, and it was driven roughly 1\/3 from each of some delays in spending, so some expanding that we expect to hit in SG&A and R&D that we expected in Q1 that will now be pushed out to later quarters. The second, third would be foreign exchange, and specifically related to the new tax legislation. And then the third piece, that drove better adjusted earnings per share in Q1 than we originally expected was the benefit from -- the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. In terms of how our guidance for 2018 has changed since February, back in February, we expected $4.43 to $4.63 for the full year, and that $0.07 gap from the midpoint of that range to our new range of $4.50 to $4.70 is really driven by couple of things. One, greater SG&A, principally due to foreign exchange. So as we translate OUS expenses at current rates, we realize higher expenses from SG&A; the second is greater spending on research and development. And both including some of the investments we fund with the tax savings as well as the new CENTERA trial that's driving higher R&D expense than we had factored in during our guidance last year -- last quarter. And the third one is it's really more than offset by this greater excess tax benefit and the tax reform. So all net-net, it gives us a little bit of pick up to the tune of $0.07 at the midpoint of the range from February to today.","Robert Hopkins","And then the Q2 dynamic?","Scott Ullem","So Q2 dynamics, part of it is just really the ETB, that excess tax benefit that was front-end loaded. We had our stock price traded up significantly in the first quarter. We also had additional option exercises that were not factored in. And so that was the lumpiest piece in Q1 that we are not modeling to finish in Q2. The other piece is just step-up from spending from the tax savings in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen","One, on the low-risk indication one on Ultra. So Mike, the investor debate around low risk is I think less about the outcome, which people expect to be positive. It's more around the opportunity and adoption. Specifically, I think some people have questioned whether the low-risk population's already penetrated. And given your surgical heart valve business continues to grow, it would suggest to me that the answer to that is no. The other question is will the greater importance of durability in the low-risk population, will that slow adoption? So what are your views on these questions? And as I said, I have one follow-up on Ultra.","Michael Mussallem","So we think that low risk is a very significant opportunity. I think sometimes, people get confused and they think that low risk means younger patients. And although that might seem to be the case, there's actually very -- there's a high number of low-risk patients that are elderly, many in their 70s, 80s and more. It's just the way that the system works. And so I think you shouldn't underestimate what happens. And I think TAVR would be the particular beneficiary of that. The more we study this, the more we find that there's real obstacles for patients to be treated. We think that the sites, by and large, do stay on label, that they're very concerned about the payment policies and so that's important to them. And we continue to believe that the estimates that we put out about the size of the market in 2021 and beyond are still, if anything, conservative.","Lawrence Biegelsen","That's helpful. Then on Ultra, Mike, I heard your comments on the U.S. in conversation with the FDA. What is required by FDA from a regulatory and clinical data standpoint? I'm asking because, obviously, what happened in Europe was a bit of a surprise to everybody. And my understanding is, and perhaps I'm wrong, but you're going to use overseas data for the U.S. approval. So I'm asking because we just want to understand why you're so confident in a late 2018 approval for Ultra in the U.S.","Michael Mussallem","Yes. So we did, as I mentioned, we did get surprised by the Ultra approval process in Europe. We had initially believed, and this was through conversations with regulators, that we wouldn't require clinical data. And then ultimately, we did require them, so that was a hit to timing. We've had an ongoing dialogue with FDA. We typically don't share the ins and outs of our regulatory process. But as I said, we continue to be very confident in our ability to be able to get Ultra approved in the U.S. by the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Rajbir Denhoy","I wondered if maybe I can ask a couple on the mitral developments. You noted Cardioband still less than $1 million revenue in the quarter. So I guess, I'm curious about either the ramp there, you noted $15 million for the year is still your target, but what's been the level of interest in that product? Are there a lot of clinicians in Europe that are looking to get trained? And how quickly can you start to see a faster result out of that business?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, Raj. Actually, we've probably been the ones constraining ourselves. We felt a lot of interest on the part of clinicians. They have a lot of interest who want to join this, and the good news is that the procedural success rate has been quite good. As I mentioned, we're integrating the supply chain into the Edwards Quality System. And that's taken us longer than we thought. And so it means that we have to be thoughtful in terms of the way that we dish out supply. Remember, we're also feeding clinical trials in addition to our commercial success. And our goals in the near term really are not to maximize commercial sales but to learn as much as possible and to make progress on our regulatory pathways.","Rajbir Denhoy","And has there been any change or improvement in the treatment time or the procedure time with Cardioband yet?","Michael Mussallem","Yes, there have been improvements. There's -- the procedure times have been coming down. Most of that I would attribute to learning curve. We're probably moving from procedures that were more in the 3-hour range to the 2-hour range. We've got bigger plans for ourselves in terms of next-generation systems. But even while we're within the existing system, there have been improvements in procedure times.","Rajbir Denhoy","Maybe just lastly, on the replacement side. You noted the positive data on the 10 patients on the M3 device. Have you sort of changed your thinking? Or is there a horse in that race now you're preferring between CardiAQ and M3 at this point? Or it's really get to make any sort of decisions there?","Michael Mussallem","Yes, it's early. We're continuing to see good clinical programs for -- good clinical progress for both of those transseptal programs. So we're pleased with it. It's been going well and we're not trying to send a signal that we have a preference.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","It's still a little early in earnings season, so I was trying to piece together kind of the commentary we've seen from various companies and wondering if you thought there might have been any impact to TAVR volume from whether it be seasonal items like flu, or just the deductible dynamic in health care leading to fewer inpatient days. Anything really that were at the margin displaying some incremental headwind that you didn't have in the same period last year?","Michael Mussallem","Yes, it's very difficult for us to say, Isaac. I can understand your question. So for example, in the fourth quarter of last year, we felt like we saw more activity than we would have anticipated sort of in that last week or so of the year that's normally affected by holidays. Did that have any impact on Q1? I don't know. We had the Easter holiday that actually crept into the very end of Q1. So those things probably have some impact here on the margin. Our folks have count selling days, saying, Hey, there might have been a 1% difference between one and the other, if that's helpful.","Isaac Ro","Sure, that's helpful. And maybe a follow-up on the pricing environment. I imagine that there's not a big change there, but curious if you can maybe communicate kind of what transpired in the quarter from a pricing standpoint, if there was anything notable?","Michael Mussallem","Yes, generally, when we talk about pricing, Isaac, we're talking about it in constant currency, so that was pretty flat. You go right around the globe, and usually what we're most susceptible with is what happens in terms of the geographic mix. Actually, the thing was kind of interesting. This quarter is the very favorable trend that we saw in Europe. And so because the euro strengthened and actually made what the sales prices that we realize in dollars are much higher out of Europe, it actually would have ended up affecting the global rates if we would do it on an actual basis, but we try and stay out of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","So maybe I'll start one with the TAVR volume for OUS. I think I heard you guys say international was up low double digits, that would imply the U.S. volumes growth of 14%. I just want to know, one, is that math correct? And second, when you talk what the impact from Medtronic royalty, where was that being recognized? Was that being recognized in U.S. TAVR revenues or OUS -- international TAVR revenues?","Scott Ullem","Maybe I'll start with -- it's Scott, with the answer to your second question, which is we realized the Medtronic royalty revenues in our U.S. THV business. And as I give it back to Mike, could you just repeat the first part of your question?","Vijay Kumar","So the volume growth, I think I heard you guys mentioned 10% in international for TAVR. That would imply 14% growth for U.S. Is that the right number?","Michael Mussallem","Okay. Yes. So I think what we said was OUS procedure growth was low double digits, and we said THV procedures in the first quarter in the U.S., we're in the mid-teens versus prior year. So I don't know, does that help, Vijay?","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful, Mike. Just maybe one last one on gross margin. It looks like it was a little light for this quarter. When you look at that guidance range for the year, 74% to 76%, maybe can you just help us on what are some of the moving factors as you progress sequentially? It looks like there's an [indiscernible] coming in below the midpoint for the year, so I just wanted to understand what drives in the back half. Is this FX or something else going on? Or is this pricing?","Scott Ullem","Sure. So maybe up we've lightened up a little bit as you model gross margin for the rest of the year, something like 20 basis points, but it really gets lost in that range of 74% to 76%. Using the middle of that range is still probably a good modeling assumption. In the first quarter, you're right, FX was a big piece of it and the other difference from Q1 of 2017 was continuing manufacturing investments. Both of those were partially offset by mix. So as you know, we've been continuing to see a pickup on mix and gross margins as a result of the faster growing THV business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Two quick clarifying questions, and have a quick one on CENTERA. So first, Mike, outside the United States, you talked about growing below the markets, so that's share lost to your largest competitor, that's Medtronic. But if you added Abbott and Boston, they're starting to trend in that $100 million range, I'm wondering if you're seeing any share lost to Abbott or Boston Scientific in Europe. And then as other clarifying question, you said in the SAPIEN 3 low-risk CAP, even if you maxed out that CAP this year and add 1% to growth, were you referring to just TAVR growth or overall company growth?","Michael Mussallem","So on the first question, I wouldn't say that we saw anything notable from Boston and Abbott. I don't know if Boston is back to where they were, but I think those smaller competitors are probably in the mid-teens growth sort of market share rates. So it hasn't changed a lot over a pretty substantial period of time. Will you repeat the second part of the question, Glenn, to make sure I have it?","Glenn Novarro","Yes. You said that the SAPIEN 3 low-risk Continued Access Program in the United States. I think you maxed it out this year. You said it would add 1% to growth. I'm assuming you meant 1% of TAVR growth, correct?","Michael Mussallem","Yes, it's actually one of my -- specifically, I said less than 1%, but yes, I'm talking about TAVR growth.","Glenn Novarro","Great. I just want to clarify. And then just a quick one on CENTERA. You gave us details, 1,000 patients enrollment starting sometime midyear. Should we assume a year to enroll, a year of follow-up and a year through the FDA, meaning FDA approval if all goes well in 2021, is that a reasonable assumption?","Michael Mussallem","Yes, it's pretty early for us to be assuming. I mean there's -- I don't think there's any reason to assume that this is going to be particularly slow. There seems to be a lot of excitement amongst our clinicians. So we'll see and will keep you informed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Frederick Wise","I also want to touch on CENTERA, if I could, Mike. You talk about CENTERA launch -- sort of a targeted launch in Europe. Maybe help us understand the thinking behind your decision to do this, so the targeted approach. We've continued to do ongoing doc checks and everybody is saying incredibly stable deployment, incredibly high device success, low needs for recapture repositioning. I'm hearing great feedback. The pushback is on price. So maybe just update us in your thinking about why the targeted center approach are you continuing to get this kind of feedback? And could this be a preview of how you roll out CENTERA in the United States?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. So I mean, the short answer, Rick, your observations are correct. We also have heard a lot of enthusiasm about CENTERA and there's a real demand for it. We have decided to price this valve at a premium. As a matter of fact, even a premium to SAPIEN 3 and you know that SAPIEN 3 is at premium to competitive valves. And so I think, and that's for a very -- it's country specific. And it's just reflective of the fact that this is our latest technology and we think highly differentiated from what others see. And that's the strategy that were deploying. So we're being very thoughtful about what centers we go to and how fast and focused on really high level of procedural success.","Frederick Wise","All right. And in Japan, just a briefer question. Obviously, a smaller market, but you highlighted the -- it's one of your better growers in TAVR. Where are we in penetrating the market, let's say, number of centers? Or how much more is there to go in terms of expanding centers or gaining share? It seems like one of your bigger incremental growth drivers ahead, if that's the right way to characterize it.","Michael Mussallem","Yes. We think Japan is a big opportunity. It is the fastest-growing THV region, again, this quarter. Adoption is still very early. They could use a lot more centers. I don't know what the number is, it's certainly less than 150. They could use a lot more to be able to really penetrate the opportunity and we think that demand is going to continue to be strong for quite a while.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Marcus with JPMorgan.","Robert Marcus","Maybe I can start off, you did 12.5% underlying TAVR growth in the first quarter, and you reiterated your confidence in the upper end of the 11% to 15% range. Maybe you could talk about, a, what gives you confidence, and b, maybe some different plus or minuses as we think about the balance of the year.","Michael Mussallem","Yes. As we mentioned, we think the market is growing in the mid-teens, and we think we have a highly competitive program. And so we would expect to also be able to grow in the mid-teens for the rest of the year. We do have the headwind of the Medtronic royalty, which will cost us a little bit. We have a little bit of a tailwind although it's small, off the CAP program. But overall, we think we're well positioned to be able to obtain that high end of 11% to 15%.","Robert Marcus","And they maybe, Scott, you iterated sales guidance at the upper end of the $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion range, and there's about incremental $80 million in FX this quarter. Should we be thinking about any changes to the underlying growth of the company? Would you have had to lower guidance this quarter without the benefit of FX? Or how should we be thinking about that?","Scott Ullem","For underlying growth number, originally, we expected somewhere in the 9% to 10% range. Now we're more in the area of 10% to 11% range of underlying growth. So FX is helping the nominal sales, but there's also strength in the underlying business. Sorry, Robbie, you also asked about $80 million. It's $80 million in FX tailwinds for the year. I think you might have said a month some of the quarter. So it's $80 million, or we call it about 2% of total consolidated sales in FX tailwinds.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust.","Bruce Nudell","Mike, just to clarify, should we continue to expect mid-teens procedure growth for TAVR in the U.S., low double digits x U.S.? And could you just elaborate on the cost of share loss in Europe? And I have a follow-up.","Michael Mussallem","Yes, so overall, I think those are reasonable assumptions. We're, like you, watching it very closely, but I think those are reasonable assumptions. The bigger picture here is this disease is undertreated and there's every opportunity for us to be able to do that, and we're focusing even more efforts on disease awareness. But I think those kind of market growth rates are healthy. Now did you say you wanted to talk about the share shift?","Bruce Nudell","Yes. Just any causal explanation you could proffer.","Michael Mussallem","Yes, I mean, what we're talking about is specifically in Europe, we think there's economic pressure on customers and so that causes the difference in THV pricing to be a source of pressure. And we think that's a relatively tough issue for some customers. What I also indicated, though, is when we're able to add products like SAPIEN 3 Ultra and CENTERA, that really helps us because those products are highly differentiated and the clinical performance there we expect to be significant. So again, the -- what we tried to relate earlier is that the share shift was a year-over-year share shift, not a quarter-over-quarter share shift. So I'm just trying to put it in perspective.","Bruce Nudell","Perfect. And then my follow-up is regarding COAPT. COAPT is coming up with the TCT. Do you suspect there will be a positive signal as to clinical benefit either with death or rehospitalization or both? And if it doesn't occur, how impactful will a negative result be for market development?","Michael Mussallem","Yes, I'd rather not comment in terms of whether I think it's going to be favorable or not. If it's favorable, I think it would be very beneficial to the opportunity because it was just build confidence. Conversely, if it's negative, I'm going to guess that a lot of clinicians look at it and suggest that the problem was the trial endpoint design. And so I don't know that it's really going to be much of a negative for the opportunity. I can tell you ourselves, we work very closely on trial designs in TMTT. And there's going to be a number of data sets over the next year. COAPT's certainly be one of them. But I think you're going to see more data than ever before. And we continue to be very optimistic about the opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.","Christopher Pasquale","Mike, first, can you provide any details on the complications you saw in the Harpoon study?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. What was reported, Chris, was the return of mitral regurgitation. So we're digging into it and trying to really understand it. It's early in our evaluation and we don't really know the cause of it at this point. But that's what the clinicians called to our attention, and that's why we decided to pause here and make sure that in the abundance of safety here, that we understand what's going on.","Christopher Pasquale","Okay. And then do you still expect to get back in the clinic with the FORMA tricuspid spacer sometime this year? And then lastly, for me, is there anything you want to highlight coming up at PCR?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. So we did resume treating some patients this quarter, just a few of them. And so we got some real procedural learnings, and the learnings have been helpful. So we're still evaluating that therapy. You're going to see probably more in the -- it's still early. You're probably going to see more coming from Cardioband tricuspid in the near term in terms of data sets.","Christopher Pasquale","And PCR, anything you guys want to highlight next month?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. So at PCR, we expect Cardioband, both the mitral and tricuspid data sets to be presented. It will be early, but there should be presentations there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuench with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","A couple of housekeeping items. First, the tax rate guidance for this year, should we consider that a go-forward rate also?","Scott Ullem","So, it's Scott. I think probably not, simply because we had such extraordinary tailwinds benefit from this excess tax benefit from stock-based accounting. So it's always really hard to predict, really impossible to predict because we don't know our stock price is going. But I think if you look back to our original guidance for the year of 15% to 18%, that may be a better modeling assumption longer term, and we'll keep you updated as more information becomes available. Also keep in mind, we've gotten continual updated guidance from IRS and treasury about the impacts and the interpretation of this new tax legislation. And so that will also have an influence. And to that end, some of the tax reform benefit that we're realizing now will tail off especially as it relates to some of the compensation-related deductions.","Joanne Wuensch","And the Medtronic royalty step-down this year, could you remind us when the next step-down is if there's one?","Scott Ullem","Is really, without getting all the details of the settlement agreement from back in 2014, just you should model, assume the $40 million minimum. And we'll let you know if that assumption should change at all in the years ahead.","Joanne Wuensch","All right. And then my last question is when you purchase Valtech, you had to really build out the sales force. Can you sort of give us an idea of where that is and how you're thinking about throwing other mitral products into the sales bag?","Michael Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Joanne. Yes, we're building that team up in Europe. And again, we expect to have a number of launches as mentioned that we would have one mitral launch per year in each of the upcoming years since our intention is to be able to use this clinical team. This is a team that's doing clinical trials. We have a separate team that's actually doing clinical support of cases as well as sales people. So that team has been developing nicely. We have primarily focused in Germany at this point, but it's very consistent with what we have planned.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company.","Joshua Jennings","I was hoping to just ask first a follow-up on Larry's earlier question about the low-risk opportunity and focus on the bicuspid registry. I'm assuming positive results. Do you see like that is enough from a clinical evidence standpoint for inclusion in the label? And then secondarily, is it good enough to convince the clinical community, particularly the surgeon community? And then lastly, on bicuspid, is there anything within the design of SAPIEN 3 Ultra that could potentially provide a benefit in bicuspid cases? And I just have one follow-up.","Michael Mussallem","Yes, thanks. So this bicuspid registry, I think it's around 100 patients in this trial. And so we're glad to be able to do that. I think it sounds like you understand it pretty well, Josh. It's not contraindicated today, and so people can do it. And we have a number of clinicians that are real believers in treating bicuspid patients and they do it with SAPIEN 3 and I know that's all being accumulated in the TVT Registry. So they are being treated today. Having more data is just going to be helpful to be able to have a nice data set here that we can follow on an ongoing basis. It's just going to help reinforce it. But I think the TVT Registry had already pretty positive support for treating bicuspid patients with SAPIEN 3.","Joshua Jennings","Great. Is there anything on to SAPIEN 3 Ultra design that could potentially be beneficial specifically for bicuspid cases or which we now be thinking?","Michael Mussallem","Well, I mean, we like the -- not only the delivery system, but the design of the [indiscernible] and we think it is going to help potentially with tissue ingrowth and should even improve what's already a best-in-class leak performance for that valve. But I don't know that it should -- that it'll make a market difference in bicuspid.","Joshua Jennings","Great. And then just lastly on EARLY TAVR, any inkling on the enrollment pace and just specifically, any data around screening of patients on the stress test kind of initial stage? And whether or not you're seeing those patients screen in as actually symptomatic aortic stenosis patients?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. Well, thanks a lot. No, we're not going to report any specific data on that, Josh. We'll just say generally, it's ramping up really nicely. There's a lot of enthusiasm on the part of the investigators and I'm sure the investigators themselves are going to want to share some of that detail in terms of what they're finding when they get to the right point to that trial.","Michael Mussallem","Okay. Well, thank you very much for your continued interest in Edwards. And Scott and David and I welcome any additional questions by telephone after the fact. So back to you, David.","David Erickson","Thank you for joining us on the call today.

Just after the close of regular trading Edwards Lifesciences, released its First Quarter 2019 Financial Results. During today's call, management will discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules. And then use the remaining time for Q&A.","Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Scott Ullem, CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during today's call, management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions, and projections. These statements include but aren't limited to financial guidance, and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters, and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today.","Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in the press release, our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and Edwards's other SEC filings, all of which are available on its website at edwards.com.","Also a quick reminder that when using the terms underlie and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise they are referring to GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release at Edwards.com.","Now I will turn the call over to Mike Mussallem.","Mike Mussallem","Thank you, Roya. It's been an exciting start to 2019 with multiple positive developments for the company and the patients we serve.","Most notably, we announced groundbreaking results of the PARTNER 3 Trial which demonstrated the superiority of our SAPIEN 3 valve technology and provides a strong platform for future growth.","Also CMS published a draft national coverage determination or NCD for TAVR which could provide improved access for this therapy in the U.S. for even more patients suffering from aortic stenosis who today don't receive treatment. These important developments reinforce our confidence in the continued growth of TAVR.","In addition, we received CE Mark for PASCAL, an important early addition to our portfolio of TMTT therapies. We are also pleased to recently complete the acquisition of CASMED a cerebral oximetry technology that will enhance the smart monitoring strategy of our critical care platform. I'm more convinced than ever in the tremendous opportunity to drive success for many years to come through our differentiated strategy of focus, innovation, and leadership.","Turning to our financial performance. We're pleased to report nearly $1 billion of sales this quarter representing 9% sales growth on an underlying basis. This was consistent with our expectations driven by our broad portfolio of new technologies.","In transcatheter aortic valve replacement, first quarter global sales were $59 million, up 10% on an underlying basis as expected. Recall that we previously forecasted our first quarter sales growth would be below our full-year range and that our sales growth rate would ramp following Q1.","We grew at a slightly lower rate than the estimated global procedure growth due to a modest year-over-year share decline. We estimate our global competitive position was unchanged versus the fourth quarter and we continue to exercise price discipline holding global average selling prices stable.","We continue to believe there is a large number of patients suffering from aortic stenosis who are either undiagnosed or untreated. We're investing more in programs to increase awareness, increase diagnosis, and improve referral patterns and help patients receive the care they need based on medical guidelines.","One of our biggest investments is in clinical evidence to support indication expansion, and in March, the PARTNER 3 trial results were presented at the Annual ACC Scientific Session and published by The New England Journal of Medicine demonstrating that Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve proved superior to surgery. We were excited that these robust outcomes continued the steady and impressive progress that we have seen from the 17-year series of rigorous clinical experiences and trials which clearly support TAVR as a proven therapy for aortic stenosis patients.","In the U.S., we estimate total TAVR procedures for the first quarter grew in the low-double-digits versus the prior year and our growth was comparable. Growth was highest in newer and smaller centers which provided access to a broader population of aortic stenosis patients.","Patients continue to be treated through the PARTNER 3 low risk continued access protocol. Our guidance continues to assume receipt of a low risk indication late this year.","We continue to enroll the U.S. pivotal trial to study our self-expanding CENTERA valve in intermediate risk patients. We estimate enrollment of this trial will be completed next year.","The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS recently released a draft with modernized NCD which we believe better reflects today's practices and the needs of patients. We commence CMS on the proposed policy and are encouraged to see elements within the draft NCD to enable patient access particularly underserved populations. And it would enable a future move toward measuring hospitals quality outcomes with metrics instead of procedural volume measure.","We will provide input this week on the draft NCD which is expected to be posted on the CMS website shortly thereafter. We continue to assume any changes to the current NCD are unlikely to significantly affect our estimated long-term global TAVR opportunity. We expect the new NCD to be finalized by the end of June 2019.","Outside the U.S., in the first quarter, we estimate total TAVR procedures grew in the low-double-digits while Edwards procedure growth on a year-over-year basis was slightly lower. We believe our competitive position remains stable versus the fourth quarter. We continue to see excellent longer-term opportunities for growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR therapy is still quite low.","In Europe, we estimate the TAVR procedures grew low-double-digits and our growth was lower. Edwards growth in countries with lower TAVR adoption rates continue to outpace countries where the therapy is more established.","We're implementing a disciplined commercial introduction of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra and CENTERA systems in Europe as we focus on achieving high procedural success rates and therefore did not significantly impact first quarter growth. We're receiving positive impact from physicians on the unique features offered by both technologies.","In Japan, we continue to see strong TAVR adoption driven by SAPIEN 3 and new centers are being qualified. We believe aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease among the large elderly population in this country and continue to focus on expanding the availability of this therapy.","In summary, we're encouraged by the recent strong PARTNER 3 evidence supporting the adoption of SAPIEN 3 which has reinforced our confidence in achieving our underlying sales growth for 2019 of 11% to 15%. It has also reinforced our confidence in the $7 billion opportunity by 2024.","Turning to our Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid therapies, or TMTT, first quarter global revenue was approximately $4 million lifted by the initiation of our PASCAL Mitral launch in Europe. We were pleased to receive the CE Mark a couple of months earlier than expected. As we begin the commercial rollout of this differentiated and novel repair therapy, we remain focused on physician training, procedural success, and great outcomes for patients, and are pleased with our progress thus far.","We also continue to treat patients commercially with our Cardioband Mitral and Tricuspid Annual Reduction Therapy transferring the production of Cardioband to other Edwards manufacturing facilities remains on track and we continue to expect supply constraints to be progressively lessened throughout 2019.","On the political front, we continue to invest heavily in the advancement of our portfolio therapies for patients with Mitral and Tricuspid valve disease. And we are pleased to have treated patients with all of our therapies in the first quarter.","Related to PASCAL, in the U.S., we are adding clinical sites and making progress with the enrollment of our CLASP IID pivotal trial to study PASCAL in primary or degenerative mitral valve disease. We also continue to expect the initiation of our CLASP IIF pivotal trial for patients with secondary or functional mitral valve disease in late 2019.","In mitral valve replacement, we remain strong believers in our transseptal strategy and are pleased with the progress and early clinical results in both of our novel platforms.","We continue to enroll patients in our EVOQUE early feasibility study and we're on track to initiate a U.S. pivotal trial of SAPIEN M3 in late 2019.","In Transcatheter tricuspid repair, we're gaining significant clinical experience through our U.S. early feasibility studies for PASCAL, Cardioband, and PHARMA, and we expect to initiate a U.S. Tricuspid pivotal trial in late 2019.","As shared previously, Abbott has filed multiple lawsuits against Edwards related to PASCAL in both the U.S. and Europe. Recently, the U.S. District Court in Delaware heard Abbott's motion for a preliminary injunction. We expect a favorable decision in the near future. Litigation does add risk but we plan to vigorously defend ourselves so that we can continue to provide our differentiated PASCAL therapy as a much needed option for undertreated patients.","Overall, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities to treat patients suffering from tricuspid and mitral valve disease with our transcatheter therapies. We're on track to achieve our 2019 milestones including achieving our revenue target and continuing enrollment in four pivotal studies. And you can expect to hear more in updates at DGK, the Cardiology Society in Germany, EuroPCR, and TVT Medical meetings.","In summary, given our first quarter CE Mark for PASCAL, we have increased confidence in achieving approximately $40 million of total TMTT revenue for 2019. We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach approximately $3 billion by 2024, and are passionate about bringing solutions for these deadly diseases and improving patient's lives around the world.","In surgical structural heart, sales for the first quarter of $215 million were up 3.5% on an underlying basis. First quarter growth was lifted by the sales of premium products particularly through the adoption of the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve which drove an increasing share of surgical aortic valve procedures.","We have now successfully launched INSPIRIS in all major regions and are encouraged by the steady growth and adoption of this new class of resilient tissue valves. This valve is designed to be an attractive option for active patients and we have observed a continued trend of physicians treating younger patients with INSPIRIS versus traditional surgical tissue heart valves.","Separately, we remain on track to begin treating patients with our Harpoon system in Europe by mid-2019.","In summary, in surgical structural heart although the superiority results in PARTNER 3 are expected to provide an incremental headwind to our aortic surgical sales, we continue to be comfortable with our full-year underlying sales growth range of 1% to 3% based on our strong first quarter momentum. Even as TAVR adoption expands, we're excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatments for more patients and to extend our global leadership in surgical structural heart technologies.","In critical care, sales for the quarter were $176 million and grew 11% on an underlying basis. All product lines contributed to this performance boosted by a surge of HemoSphere sales primarily in the U.S. HemoSphere our all-in-one monitoring platform is expected to be an important growth driver in 2019 as we continue with the full market launch of the platform with our FloTrac System and our Acumen Hypotension Predictive Index. This platform is designed to provide greater clarity on a patient's hemodynamics status, while introducing artificial intelligence to improve decision making.","Last week, we completed the acquisition of CASMED a non-invasive cerebral oximetry monitoring technology company. We believe the incorporation of this technology into Edwards leading hemodynamic monitoring platform, along with our predictive analytics capability, will strengthen our leadership in smart monitoring technologies. CASMED's annual sales were $22 million in 2018 and we expect minimal impact on our underlying near-term sales growth and earnings from the CASMED acquisition as we work to integrate our technologies.","In summary, given the fast start in Q1, we are more confident in achieving full-year 2019 underlying sales growth in critical care of 5% to 7%.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Ullem","Thanks Mike.","We are pleased with our start to the year in which we generated underlying sales growth of 9% consistent with our expectations. TAVR sales were $598 million. As previously communicated, we expect our sales growth rate to ramp up following the first quarter as we introduce new products and benefit from the recent clinical evidence supporting TAVR therapy.","Let me remind you that in addition to foreign exchange, our reported sales growth this quarter includes two prior-year adjustments. The first quarter of 2018 was impacted by adjustments related to our German stocking sales and surgical consignment conversion in the United States. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.32 higher than we anticipated as a result of better production efficiencies, a more favorable tax rate, and deferred expenses.","GAAP earnings per share was $1.18 and was impacted by our previously announced $24 million charge related to the acquisition of Strategic Transcatheter Technology. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.","I'll now cover the details of our first quarter results and then discuss guidance for 2019. For the quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.7% compared to 74.5% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven primarily by the favorable impacts from foreign exchange and product mix. This quarter, we were pleased that operational efficiencies offset the continued investments in our manufacturing capacity. We continue to expect our full-year 2019 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $280 million or 28.2% of sales compared to $256 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by field personnel-related expenses partially offset by the weakening of the Euro against the Dollar. We continue to expect SG&A excluding special items to be between 28% and 29% of sales for the full-year 2019.","Research and development expense in the quarter grew 20% over the prior year to $171 million or 17.3% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of significant investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs, including an increase in clinical research for the PASCAL system. For the full-year 2019, we continue to expect research and development excluding special items to be between 17% and 18% of sales.","Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate was 10.2% for the quarter or 10.6% excluding the impact of special items. This rate included a 610 basis point benefit from the accounting for employee stock-based compensation which was 190 basis points or $0.03 favorable to our guidance expectation. Our rate also benefited from lower U.S. taxes on foreign earnings stemming from U.S. Tax Reform. We continue to expect our full-year 2019 tax rate excluding special items to be between 12% and 14%.","Foreign exchange rates decreased first quarter sales growth by approximately 3% or $26 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we continue to estimate an approximate $60 million negative impact or about 1.5% to full-year 2019 sales compared to the prior year. FX rates positively impacted our first quarter gross margin by 180 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates positively impacted earnings per share by about a penny reflecting our effective currency hedging program.","Adjusted free cash flow for the first quarter was $139 million defined as cash flow from operating activities of $1 million, less capital spending of $42 million, and excluding a $180 million payment related to our previously announced global intellectual property litigation settlement.","Our first quarter free cash flow is traditionally our lowest quarter during the year and we continue to expect full-year 2019 adjusted free cash flow to be between $800 million and $900 million. In the first quarter, we were on track in implementing capital expansion projects in line with our strategy to increase global capacity and redundancy.","Turning to our balance sheet, at the end of the quarter we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $963 million. Total debt was $594 million. Average shares outstanding during the first quarter remained level with the prior quarter at $212 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2019 to be between $211 million and $213 million.","Turning to our 2019 guidance, we remain confident in achieving our expectations for financial performance in 2019 including guidance of $3.9 billion to $4.3 billion in total sales for Edwards. Our guidance for underlying growth rates remains unchanged for Edwards and our product lines. We continue to expect TAVR sales of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion, TMTT sales of approximately $40 million, and surgical sales of $810 million to $850 million.","In light of critical care's fast start to 2019, and recent acquisition of CASMED, we now expect sales of $700 million to $750 million up from our previous guidance of $670 million to $710 million. For the full-year 2019, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $5.10 to $5.35, up from our previous guidance of $5.05 to $5.30. This increase was reflective of our Q1 performance and incorporates the CASMED acquisition.","For the second quarter of 2019, at current foreign exchange rates, we project total sales to be between $1.02 billion and $1.08 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.27 to $1.37.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Mike Mussallem","Thanks, Scott.","The exciting developments that occurred so far this year reinforce our confidence and our focused innovation strategy and our longer-term outlook. And we anticipate a year of value creation as we pursue important therapies that will benefit many more patients. We look forward to launching a number of new technologies as well as achieving important milestones across all of our product lines. We're confident that our differentiated strategy and focus on leadership will continue to create value and benefit the patients we serve.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We're ready to take questions now. In order to allow broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions please reenter the queue and management will answer as many as possible during the remainder of the call. [Operator Instructions].","One moment please we poll for questions. And thank you, our first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. So maybe, Mike, I'll start with -- with the big picture question on, we had a positive ACC it looks like Q1 TAVR trends came in pretty much in line with how you guys thought it would play out. I'm just curious on there's a lot of speculation in the market rate in terms of what kind of acceleration that we could see for TAVR in the back half and the guidance at the high-end would imply at least 500 basis points of acceleration in the back half. I'm just curious on how should we be thinking of low risk. Is that going to be a contributor here in 2Q, it looks like the guidance had some contribution, how should we be thinking about share positions, is low risk going to improve your share position, we just saw that Boston got Lotus approved in the U.S. Can you just put all of those into context for us?","Mike Mussallem","Sure. Thanks, Vijay. Yes, so we expected obviously the PARTNER 3 Trial to be positive and that growth rates would accelerate moderately following Q1. And the early results have gone much the way we planned. So we really thought that this was the way, it would play out.","In terms of share position, what -- well maybe I'll just back up for a second. So our guidance is unchanged in TAVR. When we issued our assumptions about competition, what we inferred is that Boston would get their approval mid-year and that there would be an approval of the portico technology by year-end. I don't know that any of those have meaningful impact on our guidance. The Boston information is new to us. It's not something that we had looked at but I don't anticipate that it's going to have a significant impact on our guidance.","Vijay Kumar","And maybe just on the CMS NCD, it looks like there were some pluses and some minus, right. So it looks like to maintain existing centers I think some of the standards were raised. I'm just curious I think in your prepared comments you said there were some positive elements. I'm -- can you help us think on the NCD as it stands, as it's proposed. Any impact there are all on the marker or for you guys in particular?","Mike Mussallem","Well, yes, we believe that the old NCD is outdated and clearly needed to be modernized. And so we really commence CMS untackling the challenge of improving access, while trying to protect the quality of the patient outcomes. And we're encouraged by the progress that they made. Directionally we feel like the draft moves in the right direction. It doesn't achieve equipoise between surgery and TAVR but it does offer the opportunity to expand patient access and we're optimistic that the final rule is going to be an improvement over the current NCD. We just recall, well this is just a draft, so it's going to be hard to be exact with our assumptions about the impact.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","David Lewis","Thanks. Just a couple of questions for me. First is talking about the market, Mike, I think you talked at Analyst Day about more stable share for 2019 obviously in the first quarter you talked about sort of global slight share loss. From here what are the drivers of acceleration throughout the balance of your incremental share capture. And how should we think about old trends in TAVR the next three quarters and simply do we expect you to be talking about share stability and share capture over the next three quarters and a quick follow-up.","Mike Mussallem","Yes. So big picture we thought share was going to be pretty stable. We anticipated with new entrants in the U.S. that that would cost us some share but we also thought that we would do pretty well outside the U.S. So not a big change. One of the important things in addition to obviously the strength of the PARTNER 3 data is the introduction of Ultra and CENTERA. And as we indicated those really didn't have impact on our sales growth rate significantly in Q1 but were positive on the introduction of those products. We're just being very deliberate in terms of the way that we roll those out.","David Lewis","Okay. So you still believe stable share is the right way to think about 2019?","Mike Mussallem","I think it is overall.","David Lewis","Okay. And then two questions on guidance guys, one for Mike, one for Scott. Just TMTT was not expecting PASCAL to contribute as much this particular quarter. So Mike you're still thinking about the contribution of PASCAL and Cardioband the same way or should we have kind of larger expectations for PASCAL and maybe less so for Cardioband. And then for Mike, just on the guide for earnings beat by 10 raised by 5. Just kind of walk us to the bridge assuming currency was pretty neutral, I'm wondering is that just reinvestment or cash medical dilution? Thanks, thanks so much.","Mike Mussallem","Yes, so certainly the fact that PASCAL came a couple of months earlier just reinforced our confidence in that. We always felt that there would be more PASCAL than there was Cardioband and the Cardioband is that supply situation is continuing to improve. But we're also very pleased with the introduction of PASCAL.","Scott Ullem","And David, it's Scott. On the guidance increase, we're increasing both ends of guidance by a nickel. And if you assume that we beat by about a dime versus our guidance for the first quarter. Keep in mind, we expect some higher spending in Qs two through four mostly because we have some delayed spending from the first quarter and continued investments that we're making in the business. Tax is also going to be a tailwind for the rest of the year versus our January guidance but it's not large enough to offset the higher spending.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Bob Hopkins","Great, thanks for taking the question. First question is just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the reaction to the data since the ACC Meeting on the low risk side. And the reason I asked the question is that obviously as you remember back in the intermediate risk data, well now, you drove a bolus of activity and revenue before the actual approval. And the low risk data, I think is even more impressive than the intermediate risk data. So I'm just curious what the reaction has been and is there any reason why you wouldn't see a similar type of reaction in the marketplace to the low risk data as you did with the intermediate risk data?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Bob. You got to remember when we introduced that intermediate risk data; it was also at a time that we were launching SAPIEN 3. So there were a couple of things going on at the same time. We always assumed that there would be favorable trial results but we didn't assume superiority and we didn't think superiority was necessary to change practice.","But having said that, it is a boost. We've heard a lot of favorable comments from clinicians. We just know from experience that practice of medicine changes pretty slowly with guideline changes, with education, with awareness. And so we're thoughtful about just how much that changes. And again probably think of it more as a ramp than a step.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. And then on PASCAL, I just wanted to get a little bit better sense for the launch. Could you just kind of help us understand where is PASCAL launched today in Europe and how does that rollout go over the course of the rest of the year. I understand you're keeping your guidance the same but I'm just curious where it's actually launched today. And also just specifically maybe now that PCR is right around the corner, what will we see on PASCAL and PCR?","Mike Mussallem","Okay. Thanks Bob. So again we've got the CE Mark a couple of months earlier than we expected and we are launching on a pretty controlled basis in Europe. We're very focused on physician training, procedural success, great outcomes because it's really a different procedure, it's a different technology than physicians have experienced in the past and we're very -- being very deliberate about that. They're ready for PASCAL and our early experience demonstrates that there are many patients that could benefit from this therapy.","In terms of PCR, we do expect there to be data there but even before that at this meeting DGK, we would expect to see the mitral CE Mark trial. This is the class, the 62 patients at 30 days at that meeting. And I think you'll see some more information there. And then at PCR, there's a chance that we'll see six months results on that same group of patients.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, one on SAPIEN 3 Ultra, one on low risk. So, Mike, if you could give us a little bit more color on the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra in the U.S. and Europe, where are you in the process? And I'm asking because we've heard that there's been some issues with the sheath. Is there any validity to that?","Mike Mussallem","So I would just in general say that we've been more disciplined than we originally anticipated with Ultra. We've learned with experience that the system is different enough from SAPIEN 3 and that as we really try and drive super high performance. It's beneficial for us to be careful, and as you noted, it is a different sheath. And so it's something that clinicians need to learn.","We've gotten very favorable feedback on the Ultra valve but I'll also tell you that SAPIEN 3 remains immensely popular with our clinicians. So we're rolling that out at this point. We only began launching in Germany just late in the quarter. So maybe that gives us some insight into how it's going.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Thanks for that, Mike. And then on low risk, just a two part question here, Mike. So first is FDA going to want to see the bicuspid registry data and the leaflet thrombosis data from PARTNER 3 before approving low risk? And if so what's the status of those two data sets. And then secondly Mike, what's your expectation for the label with low risk with regard to a native versus tricuspid valve. In other words is it possible that bicuspid could be off-label? Thanks for taking the question.","Mike Mussallem","That's a lot of questions, Larry. I hope I remember them all.","So let me start from the beginning. We don't necessarily think that FDA is going to hold it up waiting for the registry on bicuspid. We think that what was submitted should be adequate for approval. I'll just add that bicuspid is not off-label today and we don't expect that to be a change when the new technology is ultimately approved.","In terms of the questions about leaflet thrombosis, we're going to continue collecting that but we think that the data submitted is adequate for approval.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please proceed.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. Mike, could you just confirm which tricuspid product do you expect to get into U.S. pivotal trial by the end of this year. I'm assuming that's Cardioband just based on what you said before. But I just wanted to confirm that?","Mike Mussallem","Now that's a good catch, Chris. We had a little subtle change actually into what we're guiding and you're right. We had indicated that it was going to be Cardioband first but at this point we have three technologies that are going through early feasibility studies. So that includes PHARMA, PASCAL, and Cardioband and we'd like to -- we're just trying to send a signal that we're going to fully evaluate that data before we make decisions. We're committed to start a pivotal trial by the end of the year but we're going to sort through that data first.","Chris Pasquale","Okay. And then just an update on the status of the Active trial that that had begun and then was paused, where are you guys with that at this point?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, so we did pause that trial while we're evaluating trial design and remember some of this was related to the fact that there was co-app data that was relatively new once that trial had started. So we plan to reinitiate that enrolment and get that going once we have that trial approved that we expect that to happen later in the year.","Chris Pasquale","Okay. And then just last one for me, I just wanted to understand your comments in the European TAVR market in the quarter. It sounded like things may have slowed down a little bit there versus what we saw in 2018. So would you characterize it that way? And then I just want to make sure from a competitive standpoint nothing has changed there in terms of stability versus where you were in 4Q?","Mike Mussallem","No, I think that's right, Chris. We do feel like the growth rate in Europe was a little slower, in terms of the total number of procedures, a little slower than it had been last year. Matter of fact, we think that was true globally. It was kind of interesting things seem to get off to a slower start in January almost around the globe. There may have been a little bit of an impact from billing days but it was a little bit slower growth in the quarter. We seem to see that in 2018 as well. So we're examining that more closely on a seasonal basis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.","Robbie Marcus","Hi, thanks for the question. So with first quarter coming in maybe a little bit below street estimates sort of in line with your guidance with superiority of the low risk trials, can you just help us understand the cadence of growth in TAVR to get to the midpoint of the guidance range and maybe help us understand growth in Japan versus U.S. versus Europe?","Mike Mussallem","Sure. As we've talked about in the past, right, we're probably better at predicting the long-term growth rates than we are the growth rate in a given quarter, there's a lot of things that influence it. We do think that there is going to be a sequential step-up in growth. We think the approval is important and so there we'll be -- we would think that what we would see in the near-term would be some of those borderline kind of patients whereas longer-term once we actually have an approval in place that that would help stimulate the growth of the overall number of procedures.","What was the second part of your question? Oh yes, Japan. So, yes, Japan we keep talking about there's this is a tremendous number of elderly people and therefore elderly patients and we believe the AS burden is very large in Japan. And we've been very pleased with the growth rate in Japan but the addition of centers has been quite deliberate in Japan. And so that growth rate although very positive and a contributor to our overall growth has still continued to move at a relatively slow rate. And we look forward to unlocking the potential of that opportunity over the long-term.","Robbie Marcus","Maybe I could just do one quick follow-up. The cash flow at ex the $180 million settlement was negative in the first quarter. Just walk us through your confidence in hitting the guidance and how we should think about the rest of the year in terms of cash flow? Thanks.","Scott Ullem","Yes, it's Scott. Our -- yes, it was $181 million cash flow from operations if you add back the payment to Boston Scientific. Our overall cash flow estimates for the year have not changed dollars; we're still at $800 million to $900 million for free cash flow. Just remember the first quarter is always low just seasonally. We've got a lot of confidence that we're going to be on track to do the $800 million to $900 million for the full-year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please proceed.","Rick Wise","Good afternoon everybody. Hi, Mike. Going back to ACC in the low risk data we saw from your major TAVR competitor, a couple of docs and centers I have spoken with recently are suggesting that the higher Pacer rate in the other dataset has prompted them to shift a little more in your direction in terms of share. Are you seeing that? Is that something that I know a lot of moving pieces in all these markets but is that an impact that you're seeing or we should expect to see?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Rick. Even though that feels like a long time ago, it really hasn't been so long since ACC and it's hard to deduce any significant trends at this point in time.","In terms of the difference in pacemaker, that's probably best answered by doctors. You know that it's always challenging to compare various clinical trials but we're very proud of the results that we've generated in PARTNER 3 and we think the results speak for themselves.","Rick Wise","Okay. And back to mitral, I may have missed it. Did you all reiterate your $40 million projection for 2019; you may have apologized if I didn't hear it. And just reflecting on the first quarter number and you were asked another way but just help us think about the -- if $40 million is still a number for 2019. Help us maybe frame to ourselves a little better; the drivers is it the trials and the accelerating less headwinds for Cardioband, any incremental color would be great. Thank you so much.","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Thanks very much. So what we've said is that we have increased confidence in achieving the approximately $40 million sales for total TMTT in 2019. I will add that of course the litigation adds some risk to the sales projections. But overall we feel quite good about it. We think that there's going to be a ramp that lifts over time and PASCAL was just introduced partway through the first quarter. So we're pleased with the first quarter results.","And as we indicated before, we think there's going to be more PASCAL sales than Cardioband. One of the things that's going to help out Cardioband is as we transfer production from the existing site into Edwards sites, we expect that supply condition to gradually improve. So yes, Cardioband will become more important but PASCAL will become more important at the same time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Joanne Wuensch","Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. I want to understand a little bit better on the approach to selling CENTERA in Europe, similar to how you sort of outlined the Ultra marketing efforts. Could you please give us an update on CENTERA?","Mike Mussallem","Sure, Joanne. Yes, I think we would say that we probably have slowed down the launch of CENTERA versus our original rollout plan. The original plan called for minimal proctoring based on site feedback but we're increasing the training and the proctoring requirements and that's going to affect the ramp. So even though we get some very, very positive feedback from those folks that have gone through the training and the proctoring, we find that it is a valuable feature and so we've only gone to a limited number of centers so far and we look forward to ramping that up during the course of the year.","Joanne Wuensch","Okay. And as a second question, I want to talk about pricing a little bit. What are you seeing out there on the competitive landscape in terms of average selling prices? And is there a stage at which you create internally sort of a two tier system to more competitively compete on price? Thank you.","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Joanne. So, no, we continue to see much of the same trends that we've talked about in the past in pricing. So pricing is pretty comparable in the U.S. today. In Europe, there's a big delta between us and let's say all of our competitors. We do not plan to implement a tiered pricing strategy. We -- our thought here is to introduce the very best technology that we have available and we think ultimately the Ultra Valve will be our workhorse product for Europe and the rest of the globe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed.","Jason Mills","Hi, Mike. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned the newer and smaller centers grew faster. That's been a trend that you've talked about for several quarters. It seems though that the larger older centers if you will would be most prepared fundamentally to take advantage of perhaps screening more patient's vis-\u00e0-vis the low risk approval when it comes. Could you talk about whether or not that is the case in your mind and also as it relates to the at the center level, the bottleneck used to the screening process patients can come in, want TAVR, they didn't fit into the risk profile approved by FDA with that criteria sort of liberalized to some extent. How do you think that bottleneck will change if at all or will it get better at the center level? Will the bottleneck change to a different point or will it -- will be ameliorated to some extent altogether?","Mike Mussallem","Thanks, Jason. Let me take a shot at answering your question, you can tell me if I get there or not. You're right. The big centers are the best prepared, they have the most experience and they're the best staffed in the business. And, yes, if we get some streamlining and modernizing the NCD, it clearly will improve that process and should lead to less patient visits and a process that's not as prolonged as it is today because even in the best centers, it can be painful.","So having said that, so that sounds like it's going to ramp up. I'll also mention that it's the same large centers that also are taking on competing therapies like mitral and tricuspid. So they also have a little bit of split attention. So it's -- it's a little bit of a mixed bag. We have a difficult time being very accurate with that at this point.","Jason Mills","That's fair. And then just going back to the broad question about how low risk is going to impact the TAVR market in general not only in the United States but my question is really globally and also how your share comments fit into that. Do you expect low risk the data to over the next say four to eight quarters have an impact on acceleration not only in the United States but outside the United States and I guess to bring Japan into this discussion, I'm sure they look at these data. Do you think it will have an impact on the government with respect to how many centers they allow to do this procedure or do you think those data are compelling enough to move the needle there?","Mike Mussallem","All right, I'm going to take a shot at answering there are several questions there, Jason. First of all the data was really positive and we think it's going to have some profound impact in the long-term. As we've mentioned it's going to take some time to practice medicine changes slow for a number of reasons.","Speaking of international, we've heard a lot of excitement from clinicians but we expect the impact to be a little bit more modest in the near-term because the guidelines are going to take some time to change, the actual low risk approval probably doesn't come till 2020. And also reimbursement is important in many of these countries and that's likely to change slowly.","In Japan, although this data is going to be very powerful, one of the constraints there we believe is there is simply not enough centers to be able to handle the population and the referral patterns in that country. So there may be constraints that don't have a lot to do with the excellent PARTNER 3 data.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS. Please proceed.","Matt Taylor","Hi thanks for taking the question. So the first question I wanted to ask was just simply comparing qualitatively, what you expect from the ramp once you do get approval in reimbursement for low risk versus intermediate. Do you think it could be quicker the same slower. Do you have no opinion; the data once was very good at the time?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks. That's a tough one to call. We do think it's going to be a tailwind and it'll be favorable but again we expect more of a ramp with more of a long-term impact.","Matt Taylor","Okay. I just wanted to ask one follow-up on the NCD because for some of the smaller centers, we'll see how it ultimately shakes out with the final, it'll change things. And so I was wondering from your perspective as an organization do you have to do things differently to help them get over the hump. Are you preparing for that to help do some training for them or help them streamline their screening? What are you doing to help prepare for that?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. So I'm not sure that the training is going to change, it's probably going to be the same. So many of the centers that need to be in there and obviously need to have established capabilities, they need to have the capability to handle catheter based procedures. They need to have surgical capability. It\u2019s just I think the new requirements make it accessible, the potential to make it accessible to a larger group of hospitals but there's still going to need if the draft is adopted 300 PCI's and so forth. ","So there's a limitation. We don't expect the number of centers to approach for example to more than 1,100 centers that today do surgical valve replacements. But there is the potential for it to come up and we think that we'll be able to provide the support necessary.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.","Josh Jennings","Hi good evening, thanks for taking the questions. I was just hoping to start on SAPIEN 3 Ultra and hoping you could potentially remind us on how many patients you needed to get CE Mark and an FDA approval but really the root of my question is just whether or not we should be expecting SAPIEN 3 Ultra have a similar pacemaker rate as SAPIEN 3. I think the only design difference is the added spurt feature. But if you could help us with that just because the pacemaker rate was so low in the PARTNER 3 trial. I just wanted to sanity check expectations for the SAPIEN 3 Ultra pacemaker rate that is going to ultimately become the workhorse in that which portfolio?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Josh. See, I'm not going to comment on the number of patient's necessary for the CE Mark, I don't know that we would share that and I don't think I know it myself anyway. But in terms of the permanent pacemaker rate, I'd say we don't expect it to be very different because the frame is compact and our balloon expandable designs are relatively similar and very different from the designs that you'll see from our competitors self expanding designs. We think there really is going to be a difference but we're going to have to just see that play out in the data but we're not expecting it to be substantially different.","Josh Jennings","Thanks. And then just my follow-up there was some buzz generated at ACC around prosthesis patient mismatch and potentially self-expanding valves serving patients better that had small annulus. Can you just help us think about Edwards positioning in those small annulus cases and just wanted to again sanity check that you don't think that SAPIEN 3 has been losing share in those smaller valve patients. Thanks a lot for taking the questions.","Mike Mussallem","Sure. Well you saw the distribution of valve sizes that was presented in the PARTNER 3 data and that had a full representation of all of our valve sizes and I think the results kind of speak for themselves. We had 99% of the patients that were alive and without significant stroke at a year in this really important dataset. So I think it kind of answers the question about patient prostheses mismatch. The data is sort of the ultimate arbitrator of that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Matt Miksic","Hi, thanks for taking our questions. Just two follow-ups for me. Mike, if I could on the small centers, the new centers that you mentioned contributing in the quarter, you talk a little bit about the pace of growth in these centers whether there's been any effect of either this anticipation of PARTNER 3 or anticipation of NCD that you've seen in terms of the patient growth and how do you remind us -- how you needed that to play out this year, where it might go over time. And one follow-up for Scott?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. So I think what we're really saying is that if you take a look at the new centers, their growth rate was just higher than those centers, they're much larger and been around for a while. I don't know that that's really affected by the NCD or PARTNER 3, I think it's much more attributed to the fact this is a new group of patients and now they have some local referral pathway that wasn't available before and that's the key driver of their growth.","Matt Miksic","I see and I was actually speaking more of the growth of the number of centers. Like in other words, have you seen a pickup or a slowdown or a pause or anything around the number of new centers opening up just because of the things I mentioned?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. So far the number of new centers has been pretty consistent here over the recent past. And if the draft NCD goes through it's likely to stay at a relatively consistent basis since there would be more centers added, we think they would be added gradually. But again we don't think it comes anywhere close to approaching the number of centers of the 1,100 plus centers that do surgical AVR.","Matt Miksic","Got it. Thanks. And then, Scott, if you could, you mentioned the manufacturing efficiencies, it sounded like they were sort of a pleasant surprise in offsetting some of the investments that you've been making in capacity. Can you talk about that a little bit and the sustainability of that and quantify it or any color you can provide as to how that worked?","Scott Ullem","Sure. So we actually gave a little bit of a preview to this at the Investor Conference in December and we had a slide that outlined some of the initiatives that we're really focused on including improving our yields. I'm really leaning out our operations getting harmonized across our different facilities around the world and making sure the logistics are as efficient as they can be. And then we also spend a lot of time focused on our supplier base and trying to make sure that we're being as efficient as possible and supplying components for different products.","So all that together has left us in a pretty favorable position not just in the first quarter, we think for the rest of the year as well that efficiencies may be able to offset the incremental expense associated with the continued investment in our capacity and making sure we've got redundant production facilities around the world.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Bruce Nudell","Hi guys. Good afternoon. Most of the questions have of course been asked, but, Mike, just on a qualitative level, what's been the reaction of patients and physicians to PARTNER 3 and Mick Jagger effect, I should add just given especially in PARTNER 3 what looks like a very discernible benefit in hard outcomes. I mean how eye popping is this to your clinician base and what responses patients had?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Bruce. Yes, you said it right. There's been an incredible amount of excitement around this, it was really eye popping data and the clinicians were truly thrilled especially those that have been held long history with this therapy and have seen it over the many years just get better and better. And this really feel like a big moment, I think for those of us that are very close to this and for the clinicians as well we felt like this was one of those top 10 moments in the history of the treatment of heart valves that good to see these kind of results.","So it was amazing. I'd say the results were even beyond our own expectations. But having said that, we know Ultra valve that the practice of medicine changes relatively slowly and it's going to take approval and coverage in the rest of it to happen. But we're really encouraged on a long-term basis.","Bruce Nudell","And the one thing I did notice about the proposed for the NCD was it did look like the volume requirements have gone up for -- not for starting an institution or a program but rather maintaining one. Do you feel that's an area of optimization or do you think the 40 SAVR plus TAVR cases per year is about the right level? And how much of an impact might that have on sites that can participate?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, well you know from a big picture perspective, we look forward to the day. We're not measuring quality with a surrogate like volume. So I look forward to that becoming the reality.","But having said that, I do think CMS was more moderate in terms of the volume requirements and we're not particularly alarmed by the requirements to maintain the program.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Please proceed.","Danielle Antalffy","Hey guys. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. And Mike, sorry to ask this question again. I feel like you have addressed it but I guess it's just curious on maybe a little bit more color about what gives you confidence in the growth acceleration as we move through the year. I appreciate the low risk indication but are you having conversations with the centers about their expected volume increases that gives you that confidence because it is a pretty meaningful growth acceleration? And then follow-up question I'll just ask it, now I know we're at the end of the call, but you guys talked about at the ACC at the Analyst meeting about the potential impact to intermediate risk patients and really blowing the doors off that, I mean those are my words sorry but really opening up that opportunity and accelerating penetration there. I know it was only two weeks in the quarter but did you start to see that after we saw the low risk data? Thank you so much.","Mike Mussallem","Sure. So the two things, one is why do we think that the volume is going to go up. We just think that that data that was presented at ACC and the New England Journal was really compelling data and that it will stimulate the growth of the market.","Secondly, we think the new products are very much making a difference as well. And so we look forward to that. And that's going to be -- that's going to be important. And the NCD could have some impact even beyond that so all those are favorable.","In terms of what we've seen before or what we've seen so far. I would say it's going very much as planned. We expected it to be positive and it's very early to do any predicting but things are at this point proceeding much the way that we anticipated.","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks for the question. Well the shot clock is running out on this call. And I want to thank everybody for their continued interest in Edwards. And Scott and I welcome any additional questions by telephone.","Operator","Thank you for joining us on today's call.","Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during this call which include underlying sales and growth rates and announced adjusted for special items are included in today's press release and can also be found in the Investor Relations section of the website at Edwards.com.","If you missed any portion of today's call, a telephonic replay will be available for 72 hours.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference call is being recorded.","I would now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Mark Wilterding","Thanks, Diego. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released its fourth quarter 2019 financial results.

Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important safety information may be found in the press release, our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com.","Finally, a quick reminder that when using terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures, otherwise they\u2019re referring to GAAP measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Mussallem for his comments. Mike?","Mike Mussallem","Thank you, Mark. 2019 was a year of major milestones and significant investments for Edwards. Groundbreaking PARTNER 3 clinical trial results demonstrated superiority of our SAPIEN 3 valve technology and led to U.S. regulatory approval for patients at low surgical risk. We also initiated our European introduction of PASCAL, an important early addition to our portfolio of transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies or TMTT, we extended our leadership position in surgical heart valves and implemented valuable additions to our smart monitoring technology and critical care with the growth of HemoSphere and the addition of CASMED.","Most importantly, in 2019, even more patients benefited from Edwards life saving technologies than ever before. I'd like to touch on several full-year financial highlights before I get into the quarterly details. Underlying sales increased 15% in 2019 to $4.3 billion, including double-digit organic growth in each region. Excluding special items we\u2019re able to achieve 19% growth in earnings per share, while increasing R&D by 21%.","The significant increase in R&D investments this year helped fuel important breakthrough innovations to strengthen our longer-term outlook. As you heard at our investor conference last month, we are as convinced as ever about the tremendous opportunity to enhance patients lives through the treatment of life threatening conditions and bringing significant value to the healthcare system.","Now turning to our quarterly results, we're pleased to report strong fourth quarter underlying sales growth of 19%, our sales growth this quarter was significantly higher than we expected, led by Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement or TAVR. Now let's take a closer look at TAVR. Full-year 2019 global sales of $2.7 billion increased 21% on an underlying basis over the prior-year significantly exceeding our original guidance of 11% to 15% growth. Stronger than expected 2019 growth was lifted by increased awareness of the benefits of TAVR therapy with SAPIEN 3 following the strong PARTNER 3 clinical results presented and published in the first quarter of the year. The U.S. National coverage determination released late in the second quarter also resulted in improved access for more patients suffering from severe aortic stenosis. In the fourth quarter, global TAVR sales were $7$63 million an increase of approximately 30% on an underlying basis, with impressive strength in the U.S.","We estimated global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth in the fourth quarter. Globally, average selling prices were stable and we maintained our disciplined pricing strategy. In the U.S. we estimate total TAVR procedures grew approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis and that Edwards growth was comparable. Stronger than expected growth in the fourth quarter continued to be driven by the step-up in TAVR treatments following the strong PARTNER 3 evidence that led to the recent FDA indication expansion for our SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra systems.","Fourth quarter growth was broad based across more than 700 centers in the U.S. Outside the U.S. in the fourth","quarter, we estimate total TAVR procedures grew in the high teens on a year-over-year basis, and Edwards growth was comparable. I'm particularly gratified to see the meaningful impact that our dedicated employees are having on helping so many patients around the world. In Europe, Edwards growth was in the mid-teens and we estimate our competitive position was stable.","We continue to be encouraged by the strong adoption of TAVR especially in countries where therapy penetration is still low. It\u2019s also worth highlighting that in the fourth quarter, Edwards became the first company to receive CE Mark in Europe for the treatment of patients diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis, who are at low risk for open heart surgery. Lastly, the rollout of SAPIEN 3 Ultra is well underway in the U.S. and Europe. Early clinician feedback on the Ultra valve related to improve paravalvular leak performance has been outstanding.","We feel this is a significant step forward, especially for low risk patients. In summary, based on our momentum in TAVR, we now expect our 2020 underlying sales growth to be around the top of the 12% to 15% range that we shared at our investor conference. As previously noted, while we expect this healthy trend to continue, we expect the growth rates will be lower as the year progresses, and we annualize the stepped up procedure growth following the PARTNER 3 presentation. We continue to believe this large global opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range.","Turning to TMTT, we're on track to achieve all of the milestones discussed at our recent investor conference, including executing four pivotal studies. We continue to invest aggressively in our portfolio and you can expect to hear important updates at medical meetings this year. In addition, we're pleased to announce that the EVOQUE tricuspid replacement valve system has recently received FDA approval for an early feasibility study and a breakthrough device designation, a program intended to help patients receive more timely access to designated medical technologies.","For year 2019, sales of $28 million came in below our original guidance of approximately $40 million as we continue to execute a disciplined introduction and premium pricing strategy of PASCAL which moderated European site activation. Fourth quarter revenue of $7 million was negatively impacted by the voluntary PASCAL field corrective action completed in the quarter. Importantly, we\u2019re able to minimize disruption to physicians and patients in need. Despite the slowdown of our launch cadence, PASCAL acute clinical outcomes are excellent and physician feedback is positive. As we expand the rollout, we will remain focused on procedural success and differentiated patient outcomes.","To further update our transcatheter mitral therapies, we continue to enroll patients in the Clasp IID pivotal trial study of mitral valve repair with PASCAL in degenerative mitral disease and are on track to complete enrollment by the end of the year. In addition, we're also enrolling our Clasp IIF pivotal trial for patients with functional mitral disease. In mitral replacement, we continue to gain experience with SAPIEN M3 and EVOQUE and anticipate enrollment in our M3 pivotal trial to begin in the second quarter. Early clinical evidence with both these low profile trans-delivered technologies has been encouraging.","Turning to transcatheter tricuspid therapies, we\u2019re committed to providing solutions for patients with poor prognosis and very few treatment options. We've initiated enrollment in our CLASP IITR pivotal trial to study PASCAL in patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation. As mentioned, we made meaningful progress on our EVOQUE tricuspid replacement program. And in addition, we're continuing to gain experience with our Cardioband tricuspid system in select sites as we develop our next generation technology.","In summary, we remain committed to all of the milestones outlined in our recent investor conference and continue to expect TMTT sales of $50 million to $70 million for 2020. We\u2019re optimistic that the global TMTT opportunity will grow to approximately $3 billion by 2024 and are passionate about bringing our portfolio solutions to these life threatening diseases.","In surgical structural heart, full-year 2019 global sales of $842 million increased 1.5% on an underlying basis over the prior-year in line with our original guidance of 1% to 3%. Fourth quarter sales of $205 million declined 3% on an underlying basis, reflecting lower surgical aortic valve procedures in the U.S. as TAVR adoption stepped-up partially offset by our continued strong adoption of our premium high value technologies. Despite the fourth quarter headwinds, our innovative INSPIRIS valve continue to be a growth driver in the quarter as it has been throughout the year. We remain encouraged by the actions of our focused team has taken to advance leadership as the partner of choice for surgeons.","Our surgical portfolio strategy also positions Edwards to generate sustained growth through innovation. We're pleased to confirm that late in the fourth quarter, we received European regulatory approval for our HARPOON beating heart mitral valve repair system and are in the process of beginning our commercial launch. HARPOON offers the potential for earlier treatment of degenerative mitral valve disease with faster recovery and more consistent outcomes for surgical patients. In summary in surgical structural heart, we continue to expect full-year 2020 underlying sales growth of 0% to 3%. We anticipate that surgical aortic valve procedure headwinds experience in the fourth quarter will continue into 2020 with a return to positive growth expected later in the year as we anniversary the 2019 step-up in TAVR growth.","Even as TAVR adoption expands, we're excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and to extend our global leadership in premium surgical structural heart technologies. In critical care, full-year 2019 global sales of $740 million increased 9% on an underlying basis over the prior-year, exceeding our original guidance of 5% to 7% growth. HemoSphere, our all-in-one monitoring platform grew faster than expected in 2019 following the global launch of that platform with our FloTrac sensor and our Acumen Hypotension Prediction Index software. Fourth quarter critical care sales of $199 million increased 8% on an underlying basis, driven by strong demand for HemoSphere and continued growth in smart recovery. Growth in the quarter was led by sales in the U.S.","In line with our commitment to enhance our broad portfolio of sensors, we initiated the commercial launch of FORE-SIGHT, a cerebral oximetry technology on HemoSphere in the fourth quarter. As discussed at our recent investor conference, the integration of a full-range of technologies on HemoSphere creates a unique offering of enhanced recovery tools and predictive analytic capabilities to further strengthen our leadership in hemodynamic monitoring. In summary, we continue to expect 2020 underlying sales growth of 6% to 9% and we remain excited about our pipeline of innovative critical care products. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Ullem","Thank you, Mike. I am pleased to report that our strong finish to the year enabled us to broadly exceed our financial guidance for 2019. So today I'll provide a wrap-up of 2019, including detailed results from the fourth quarter as well as provide an update on guidance for the first quarter and full-year of 2020. For the full-year 2019, sales increased 15% on an underlying basis to $4.3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $5.57 and we generated $1.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We were pleased to generate strong margins during 2019 while still investing aggressively for profitable future organic sales growth. With the repeal of the medical device excise tax at the end of 2019, we\u2019ll be able to continue our aggressive research and development investments, fund a growing field clinical organization to support patient care and strengthen our global supply chain.","Sales in the fourth quarter grew 19% on an underlying basis and adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $1.46 versus the prior-year. This reflects positive operating results partially offset by our decision to accelerate strategic spending in the fourth quarter to drive therapy awareness as well as one-time costs associated with migrating Cardioband production from Israel to Ireland. GAAP earnings per share was $1.32 which included a $41 million or $0.19 per share, non-cash impairment of Cardioband intangible assets that we referenced at last month's investor conference. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for these and other items is included with today's release. I\u2019ll now cover the details of our results, and then discuss guidance for 2020.","For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.8% compared to 76.1% in the same period last year.","This reduction was driven by spending and support of the new European medical device regulations and the migration from our Cardioband facility in Israel, partially offset by the benefit of a more profitable product mix. We continue to expect our 2020 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Our rate should be lifted primarily by an improved product mix offset by lower foreign exchange hedge gains and capacity investments. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $347 million or 29.6% of sales compared to $288 million in the prior-year. This 21% increase reflects additions we have made in field clinical personnel to support TAVR cases in the U.S. and TMTT in Europe, as well as the previously mentioned accelerated actions related to disease awareness and therapy adoption.","We continue to expect SG&A excluding special items to be between 28% and 29% of sales for the full-year 2020. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 19% to $194 million or 16.5% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs, including spending on clinical trials. For the full-year 2020, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be between 17% and 18% as we invest in developing new technologies, and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT.","Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 11.2% or 12.3% excluding the impact of special items. Stock appreciation drove a 450 basis point benefit this quarter from the accounting for employee stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full-year rate in 2020 to be between 12% and 14%, including an estimated benefit of five percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.","Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter sales growth by 40 basis points or $4 million compared to the prior-year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $25 million negative impact, or about 0.5% to full-year 2020 sales compared to 2019. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 30 basis points compared to the prior-year. Relative to our October guidance, FX rates positively impacted earnings per share by about a penny reflecting our effective currency hedging program. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $328 million. We defined this as cash flow from operating activities of $399 million less capital spending of $71 million. For the full-year 2019, adjusted free cash flow was $1.1 billion, a 35% increase over 2018.","Turning to our balance sheet, at the end of the year, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.5 billion. Total debt was $594 million. Average shares outstanding during the quarter remained relatively constant at $212.6 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2020 to be between $212 million and $214 million. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with updated financial guidance for 2020. Momentum in TAVR sales has been stronger than we expected at the time of our investor conference. As a result, we now expect higher sales in 2020, which would result in higher underlying full-year growth rates, we now expect that TAVR underlying full-year sales growth rate to be around the top of our 12% to 15% range and for the total company full-year underlying sales growth rate around the top of our 10% to 12% range. We continue to expect sales growth rates to decline as the year progresses as a result of higher prior-year comparisons. For TAVR, we\u2019re raising the bottom end of our range and now expect sales of $3.0 billion to $3.2 billion versus our previous range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion.","We continue to expect surgical structural heart sales of $820 million to $860 million, critical care sales of $780 million to $820 million and TMTT sales of $50 million to $70 million. We\u2019re raising the bottom end of our guidance range and now expect sales for total Edwards of $4.6 billion to $5.0 billion versus our previous range of $4.5 billion to $5 billion. For full-year 2020, we now expect adjusted earnings per share of $6.15 to $6.40 versus our previous guidance of $6.05 to $6.30. For the first quarter of 2020, we project total sales to be between $1.15 and $1.2 billion, $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.49 to $1.59. And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.","Mike Mussallem","So in conclusion, we're very proud of the significant progress we made in 2019 advancing new transformative therapies and delivering strong financial performance. We continue, we expect continued growth and progress in 2020. We're enthusiastic about the continued expansion of transcatheter based therapies for the many structural heart patients still in need, which positions us well for longer-term success. Edwards is fortunate to have a strong leadership position focused on serving patients who today have few treatment options for longer and better lives. We believe our patient focus innovation strategy can transform care and bring value to patients, healthcare systems, and shareholders. This year will mark the 20th anniversary of Edwards Lifesciences as a public company, and acknowledgement of this milestone, we will host our Annual Investor Conference at the New York Stock Exchange on December 10. We'll share more details on that event as we get closer. And with that, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Wilterding","Thank you, Mike. We\u2019re ready to take questions now. In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Diego?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please state your question.","Bob Hopkins","Thank you and good afternoon and congrats on a remarkable 2019. Mike if okay I'd like to start out with you, just sort of an obvious question here. Any more details you can provide on the U.S. TAVR upside that you experienced in Q4 kind of where it came from? Did you have a big pickup in the number of new centers and growth in those new centers. Just any further comments on the U.S. upside in TAVR would be great.","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Bob. I think it feels like it was a continuation of the momentum that we started to feel in the third quarter. It was broad across all segments. As we mentioned, there are more than 700 sites at this point. But we saw that growth, whether it was in new sites or some of our mature sites that are quite large centers. We think that it came across the risk spectrum and it wasn't just low risk patients coming into it, that indeed, it was patients of all risk profile. And even though there was clearly a switch from surgery to TAVR in a number of cases, we think the predominant effect was new patients coming off the sideline for treatment.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, interesting. And then I also want to ask one quick one on TMTT. Just wonder if you could give us an update on","litigation on PASCAL, just specifically Abbott has said that there could be a ruling on injunction in Germany for PASCAL in early March, as or any of you could just kind of confirm that that timeline and any other milestones in the first half of the year on litigation?","Mike Mussallem","Thanks. Well, as you know, Bob, this litigation is playing out in several countries over an extended period of time. So there's going to be a lot of stories. In fact, there was a recently completed trial in the U.K. and there's a decision that's pending on that, probably sometime in Q1. In Germany, there's going to be a couple of hearings, I think the first one to start at March, with results to follow. So and I think there's a possibility for U.S. hearing beyond that.","Bob Hopkins","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.","David Lewis","Good afternoon, just two for me. First, Mike, just to you at the ex-U.S. growth rate. There was a difference between procedure growth and constant currency growth from the quarter of about five points. Was there any particular driver accounting for that? Was it Japan stocking maybe in the third quarter? And then a quick follow-up?","Mike Mussallem","I\u2019m not sure that I'm tracking with you on the difference in the numbers, David. So maybe you're seeing something that I'm not, but I can make some general comments anyway. Although we did see a little bit in Osaka, Japan in the third quarter, it was minor by comparison, and we say generally OUS that the procedure growth in the market and our growth was pretty comparable. And it's hard for us to be exact in predicting that but we think that they're pretty close to each other. And there really was an appreciable difference in ASP either.","David Lewis","Okay, that's really helpful. And then Mike, I guess the lot of investors are focused on as you're clearly seeing TAVR acceleration, probably slightly ahead of plan but your SAVR guidance is unchanged, could you just share with us how you think we're seeing this very significant acceleration momentum in the U.S. TAVR business, but yet we're not seeing the degradation in the SAVR business, I think many people would have expected. Thanks so much.","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks David. Well, if you were asked the folks with the surgical business, they would say they're feeling what's going on right now. But again, we think that there's kind of a step-up in procedures in TAVR. And we think the bulk of that step-up is new patients coming off the sideline as opposed to switching from surgery, hard to quantify that, is it two-third, one-third, I don't know. But it's something that probably feels closer to that from our perspective. So although we're going to feel it or we're feeling it today in surgical, we feel like we rebound from that as we kind of anniversary the surgeon growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please state your question.","Raj Denhoy","Hi, good evening. I wonder if I can maybe stick a little bit more to the new centers? Is there any way you can maybe parse out what percentage of growth they might have added in a quarter such a strong quarter there's got to be some more detail you can provide for us?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Raj. Yes, I mean the new centers added, but it really was broad based. There's I couldn't say that they were a primary driver of growth. We saw it across the board. We saw it in our large centers that were some of the very first partner centers from beginning of TAVR all the way through every people that have started more recently and in between.","Raj Denhoy","Okay, maybe I could ask just one on mitral then, I noticed this quarter obviously was a little bit mixed up with the PASCAL issue had in Europe with this pricing discipline strategy you have in Europe, has there been any, anything where we can offer on that, you're seeing more receptivity amongst your customers to the premium price strategy of PASCAL as we\u2019re moving into 2020?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, so we were very committed to this. We feel like we have differentiated technology. We have a high-touch model. And we're executing this price discipline. And we're going to continue to do that, we know that there's not a lot of data out there today but we think ultimately that will prove to be the case. We obviously have confidence in this strategy. For us, it's more important to build toward long-term leadership, we're committed and feel confident in the estimate that we gave you that will have $50 million to $70 million of TMTT sales in 2020. So hopefully, that's a reflection of how we feel.","Raj Denhoy","Okay, good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.","Larry Biegelsen","Good afternoon, congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question. Mike, one big picture question for you and one TMTT question. So big picture Mike, you\u2019ve delivered 10 plus years of double-digit growth. And you're on track to do it again in 2020. But I think investors want to understand the durability of your growth. So my question is, how important is it to deliver 10% growth each year? And just how are you feeling about the durability of growth right now at Edwards and I have one follow-up.","Mike Mussallem","Well, thanks, Larry. So two different things. One is we think it's going to continue and how important is it for Edwards. You know us pretty well by now, we are not a financially driven company that just is driven only to hit a number. We really feel like when we focus on great therapies for patients and we get that just right that the numbers end-up taking care of itself and it has played out on a long-term basis. Having said that, I have a lot of confidence in our future. When you start with our biggest product area of TAVR, that continues to be one that has a lot of growth associated with remember that we said more than $7 billion by 2024, which infers a double-digit growth rate. We believe that TMTT which is a brand new addition to our portfolio has an opportunity for overall market to be $3 billion by 2024. So when you think about us pursuing a $10 billion opportunity out in 2024, it makes me feel pretty good about our prospects ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks, Mike. And how much did the ship hold impact TMTT sales in Q4 and is a mitral -- transcatheter mitral market in general developing as you expected or a little bit slower because of the MITRA-FR results? Thanks for taking the questions.","Mike Mussallem","Yes, it's a good question. We started our sales in October, it was interrupted. We had basically stopped supply during November and we restarted in December. If we wouldn't have had that, we certainly would have had higher sales growth and maybe growing modestly off of Q3. Overall, we feel good about the market opportunity. As you probably know, there's been more growth in the U.S. than there has been outside the U.S. And so probably this MITRA-FR is having some kind of impact in Europe. But we hope that we'll be able to influence that as they get to see or they get to see results from the PASCAL system. And again, when we look forward at our own results, we expect to regain momentum in Q1 and start focusing on new site activation again.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Please state your question.","Kristen Stewart","Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could maybe explain a little bit just about whether or not we would expect any data that could be coming out at the ACC Conference coming up here, we would expect to see two-year data on the risk. Any PASCAL data that could be coming up here over the coming months and then I have a follow-up.","Mike Mussallem","I can't tell you for certain number, we expect there to be some data. So for example, in TMTT, we expect there to be an update on some of the early clasp studies. So both longer-term data and more patients added maybe some data on PASCAL tricuspid and Cardioband tricuspid. So there could be those, in terms of whether we'll see two-year data on PARTNER 3, it's too early to say I don't know that there's anything official yet. So we really can't say anything until it's clear.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, and then just with respect to the safety and M3 study, I know that you had commented at the Analyst Day that you did get FDA approval in breakthrough I believe designation for that. Do you have any clarity on the trial design of that yet and any timelines that we should expect for enrollment? I know that's pretty critical. It sounds like towards you starting to achieve the timelines for getting to that $3 billion market opportunity along with PASCAL as well.","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Kris. You know what, there may be some confusion there. I don't believe we ever indicated breakthrough pathway for SAPIEN M3, what we said is that we expect to be going to clinical trial, what I just updated is that indeed is proceeding we expect to have our first patients in Q2. But bigger picture here we're very excited about having two pretty impressive transseptal replacement programs both that are transfemoral and small profile. Ultimately those that M3 trial will go up on clintrials.gov. But there's still some details being ironed out.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, thank you very much. Congratulations on a good quarter.","Mike Mussallem","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Barclays, sorry our next question comes from Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please state your question.","Jason Mills","Great. Thank you, Mike for taking the question. So, first big picture question in TAVR, years ago, when we were talking about developing the market model, I don't think we ever discussed 700 plus centers, maybe it was something less than that. So could you talk about how we've gotten sort of got from there to here, what's transpired in the market to promulgate 700 plus centers and where you think that could go now with the benefit of hindsight, it also may be within that discuss whether or not 700 to 750 centers is enough to generate the type of growth, compounded growth that you're projecting over the next couple of years or if you think that there needs to continue to be additions to the number of centers?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Jason. Well, I mean clearly we wouldn't be where we are today, if it wasn't for a greatly improved procedure, this procedure has really gotten to deliver incredible outcomes. And it's also demonstrated to be a teachable procedure, so that people that are starting new are able to stand on the shoulders of those that went before them and deliver really good results right from the beginning. And with that acknowledgement, we've had some favorable rulings and in terms of the interpretation by CMS, and with that came an updated NCD, which allows more centers to become qualified for it. If we were to look forward, we would say that maybe up to 850 have the ability to qualify as a TAVR center and again, we're not sure that all those 850 are going to go for it.","So it depends on their own site. But bigger picture, you asked the question, can we get the kind of growth necessary with let\u2019s put for example, 850 centers in the U.S., we think absolutely yes. Centers a lot of what has to change is not just center capacity, but the behavior of patients and physicians and the system and patients actually with severe aortic stenosis getting treated. And there are a number of places where the system is less than ideal. We're trying to be an assist to that but we see it getting better on a regular basis.","Jason Mills","Thank you, Mike it\u2019s very helpful and then more of a housekeeping item for Scott. Scott, when you come into the quarter and you see the press release and you see that kind of upside in TAVR relative to consensus estimates and guidance, you expected to generate positive leverage and one thing that you called out in the press release was the one-time spending associated with moving Cardioband. And perhaps there are other more one-time things in nature. But would you care to help us understand maybe what that and how that impacted, how those things impacted earnings quantitatively in the quarter? Congrats on a great quarter.","Scott Ullem","Sure. Thanks, Jason. So I guess you had two questions. One was leverage on increased sales. The second was","the impact of moving Cardioband. On the first one, so we've increased the midpoint of our sales guidance range by $50 million. And we increased earnings per share, midpoint of the range by $0.10. So that gives you a sense of the leverage that we're putting through the P&L. We are planning to accelerate some investments with some of the expected incremental sales. Regarding your second question about gross profit, yes, we've taken some decisions in the fourth quarter involving our production operations, including migrating production from Israel for Cardioband product to other Edwards facilities, including our new facility in Ireland.","And so you saw that show up in the fourth quarter results, which were a little bit lower than we expected. And it's reflected in 2020. But our guidance for 2020 for gross profit is unchanged at 76% to 77%.","Mark Wilterding","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan, please state your question.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks. And I'll add my congratulations on the great quarter as well. Scott, two financial questions for you. Maybe I'll just give them both upfront. I totally get the reasoning for investing in the business here on such a great quarter. But maybe just help us understand exactly where the investments went in fourth quarter, and how should we think about any potential ","benefit flowing through in 2020. And then second, you ended the year with about a $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, you're generating north of a $1 billion in free cash flow. What's the updated plan for utilization of cash here? Thanks.","Scott Ullem","Sure, thanks. So first question regarding where we invested extra dollars. Relative to, I guess our expectations at the beginning of the quarter, about two-thirds of the incremental investment reflected in operating expenses. They included things like disease awareness and therapy adoption initiatives. I\u2019ll just give you one example, there was announcement by the American Heart Association, November regarding an initiative that they're undertaking that we're supporting. And then we've also been adding field resources to support significant growth. You don't grow 40% in the U.S., for example NCD growth that we are expecting in Europe without also putting in resources to help support the high-touch model that we have in place.","So those probably two-thirds and then the other third is probably showed up in cost of sales. I mentioned those earlier the European medical device regulations and the migration of Cardioband production. Regarding our cash balance, our philosophy and our strategy for deploying capital is not changed. We've got a number of priorities. The first one is investing in our global supply chain to support the growth of Edwards. Second, investing externally in things like acquisitions, strategic alliances, purchasing options to buy other companies. And then third, managing the balance sheet. So we're going to continue to be a buyer of Edward stock over time and opportunistically will be executing share repurchases to help offset dilution and over time as well manage the share count down.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Please state your question.","Matt Taylor","Hi, thank you for taking the question. So I guess the first thing I wanted to ask about was the center growth and whether you have insight into how many centers could grow this year. And do you still think that we're going to get towards about a fifth year? Is it possible that there could be more given how quickly they seem to be growing here?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, well, thanks Matt. It's a little tough for us to tell how fast the centers are going to join, we saw pretty good growth in center. I think the last time we had reported on it, we said more than 650. So you can see where we are now. Yes, we look forward and try and interpret the NCD, our estimate is that about 850 centers would be qualified to do it, how many do those actually go for it and how fast they act is hard for us to know. If we're guessing we'd say we get to that kind of 850-ish number, maybe over the next year or two something like that. And so that gives you some insight, but we can't be certain.","Matt Taylor","And then I was hoping you could give us some more insight, or insight based on the trends in the U.S., the growth was so strong in Q4. It seems like you must be seeing the same kind of strong growth here in Q1. I think investors have some questions around how much of this is kind of a bolus versus sustained? And you seem to be suggesting with your comments that it's growing across the board, that it's more sustainable, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in Q1 and how it could be sustained?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Matt. Well, you know how difficult it is for us to predict quarters and we always hate to take one month and to do anything important with it. But we'll just say this, you can see what our revenue assumption is for TAVR for full-year 2020 and we think it is that the growth rate is likely to decrease during the course of the year as we anniversary the growth rates.","And that assumption is that probably Q1 TAVR looks similar to Q4 in terms of revenue dollars. You'll have to remember there was a big step-up in Q4 versus Q3. And we saw a similar trend last year going from Q4 2018 to Q1 2019. So it's hard to know for certain, but maybe that's helpful.","Matt Taylor","Okay, thanks, congrats.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys, congrats on a really solid print here. Mike, maybe on that last comment on the back half revenue growth in TAVR. The underlying of, I guess the high-end of 15% is the implication that we sustain hold the line on double-digits in the back half or maybe how should we think about the back half?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, it's a good question, Vijay. It's difficult for us to know. Do we stay at double-digits? Do we dip below it, either of those are certainly possibilities. The growth is so strong. I mean, the good news is there going to be more TAVRs done in the second half of 2020 than ever done in history. And so in terms of procedures per day, those are going to be records. Now how much growth is there over this year? It's not clear, but we've given you the probably the best guidance we can in terms of annual growth rates.","Vijay Kumar","Got you and then in yes one on the gross margins here Scott, did the recall impact you guys on the gross margins for Q1 excuse me Q4, how should we think about gross margin net progression throughout the year? Thank you.","Scott Ullem","So it's a little bit difficult to predict gross margin progression throughout the year because a lot of it ends up getting tied to our TAVR performance. But maybe I can help the least with the baseline on Q4 and explain what happened Q4 2019 versus Q4 2018, where we had about 30 basis points of higher FX and hedge gains in the fourth quarter of 2019, we did in 2018, we had about 40 basis points of mixed benefit that showed up in the fourth quarter offset by those higher operating costs that we mentioned earlier in Israel and with European MDR. So if you look up to 2020, we're expecting to continue to get mixed benefit that shows up on gross margin, it can be 50 to 100 basis points or even more. But generally, I think it's probably relatively flat during the course of the year, at least for modeling purposes. That's the right assumption at this point.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer & Company. Please state your question.","Suraj Kalia","Good afternoon everyone. Mike, congrats in an excellent quarter. So Mike, the question about capacity and your growth assumptions in TAVR had been asked. Let me see if I can come at it from a different way. Our math is suggesting roughly 140 to 150 cases per year per center in the U.S. Can you give us a perspective of what percent of the cases being done currently in these seven centers are independent in nature? And how do you look upon capacity utilization within these centers?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, good question. We don't look at it that way in terms of average number for a center, as you might imagine, there is a great difference Suraj between the amount of procedures done in a very large center and one that\u2019s small. So those are different. The thing that has been remarkable to us is the ability to have centers to add capacity. They have found a way to manage, they add more cases per day, sometimes they add on a day. Actually, it's been quite a test for our team and I'm so proud of our team has found the ability, you know we have a high-touch service model.","So we're in every one of these cases, so as they grow for us to have the ability for example to flex in the U.S. and cover 40% growth versus the prior-year was a heavy lift for us. But what happens is more patients show up the line, the list gets to be pretty long then hospitals react to that by adding capacity and so far we've been impressed about their ability to do that.","Suraj Kalia","Got it. And finally Mike, forgive me I'm drawing a blank here. Did you mention the M3 competitor arm, thank you for taking my question and congrats sort of great quarter.","Mike Mussallem","Thanks, no we didn't mention the M3 competitor arm, so that that trial design is still one that has not been finalized. And we just decided it's prudent for us not to communicate it till it's really final. So at some point that will be published at clintrials.gov and you'll see it. So we'll let you know.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please state your question.","Rick Wise","Hi, Mike, hi Scott. China hasn't come up, I think your exposure there is small, and maybe if I recall correctly, mostly SAVR and critical care. But can you remind us the impact and what you're assuming or how you're thinking about the situation? And what's reflected in guidance?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Rick. Yes, first of all, obviously our key concern is always for our employees and patients. We feel we've been fortunate so far, we haven't had any impact to employees inside Edwards that we're aware of and we've been able to maintain our supply line. So at this point, you're right, China's not really huge for us. It's still just a small percentage of Edwards sales, but we don't expect there to be a significant change at this point from what's going on with the coronavirus but we stay watchful.","Rick Wise","Okay. And just as a follow-up, it's a strange question maybe but you probably saw that Abbott\u2019s 10 dime mitral device got approved for replacement in Europe today. My question is not about that as much as, is this an important moment for the field does this, how does this make you feel about the openness of European regulators to consider the mitral waves coming at them? Does it say anything that we can extrapolate that that makes you feel better, worse, the same? Thank you so much.","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks Rick. Well, you know we\u2019re big believers and the opportunity for transcatheter mitral therapies. And so whenever there's movement and a new regulatory approval for the whole field, that's the positive. So we're glad to see that, you know about our portfolio. We're very focused on it. We're just pleased, we think what's going to be most meaningful is when we have these smaller transfemoral type systems, we think those are the things that really cause a change in behavior of patients and physicians and so we keep our eye on that, but any kind of favorable movement is good. And I think there is a general openness to innovations within the mitral, within mitral disease.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Please state your question.","Danielle Antalffy","Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really strong year and strong quarter. Mike, I was hoping you could comment on the competitive landscape specifically in the U.S., what you're seeing out there. It sounds like your competitor had called out share loss, it seems like you guys are holding on to share, not losing share. So what are you seeing and specifically I'd be curious on what you're seeing as the new centers open up and how they're adopting valve today just going with one player. And so they're a little bit more protected from loss. Just curious about how that's playing out. Thanks so much.","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks. Well, so Danielle, as we indicated, we believe that our growth was comparable to the growth that was going on in overall procedures whether that was in the U.S. or OUS, so from our point of view, not a no real change of significance in our share position in the last quarter. Now there may have been changes in share position with between our competitors, but we really don't have clear visibility to it. When we gave our guidance in December, we indicated there will probably be some modest share loss in 2020. So that's, you have to play out. We didn't, we also expected that to happen in 2019. It didn't really. ","And so it may have been just delays on the part of our competitors, but we know they're still early in their launch process.","Danielle Antalffy","And safe just a quick follow-up, safe to say in Europe, it feels like things have stabilized there, it sounds like that's what you're seeing too from a share perspective?","Mike Mussallem","We\u2019re seeing big share shifts, we obviously watch it very carefully. And that's not such a fast moving market that we don't feel like we have a reasonable handle on it. So yes, it does feel reasonably stable at this point.","Danielle Antalffy","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.","Pito Chickering","Good afternoon guys, thanks for taking my questions. First question is just dig little more into the new centers. Is your market share in those centers similar to your market share or the more established centers?","Mike Mussallem","That a good question. I'm not sure that I really have data at my fingerprint, at my fingertips on that one. My sense is that varies significantly. There are some centers that probably start up that are primarily Edwards. And there are others that may start up with others. We just say when we look at our overall growth in the U.S. the 40%, there was a nice addition from those new centers. But again, it was just we saw kind of across the board.","Pito Chickering","Great. Then on the SG&A side, I understand that hiring field personnel in the U.S. for TAVR and TMTT in Europe makes sense relative to the growth there. But can you help us break out the marketing costs you incurred in the fourth quarter and other costs recurring at similar levels in 2020, or should they decrease? Thanks so much.","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks. So I can begin here and let Scott to give out what our 2020 guidance looks like in SG&A. I mean, we try and stay one-step ahead of what we see as procedure growth, we add resources that we think would commensurate and when we have fast growing businesses like TAVR and what we anticipate in TMTT, we try and stay a little bit ahead of that. Having said that, we still think that there's probably some leverage on the SG&A line, we maintain a high level as you properly noticed of case coverage, and we're in every case. But having said that, maybe Scott, you're best to comment what our guidance is for SG&A for 2020.","Scott Ullem","I guess I'd say 28% to 29% for 2020. But in addition to the field, clinical support and selling resources that are around the field, we're also doing work around patient education regarding the severity of aortic stenosis and treatment options, the benefits of TAVR and we're doing outreach to referring physicians on therapy options available today. And so, there are other activities and expenses associated with those activities beyond just the field resources we talked about earlier.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.","Matt Miksic","Hey, thanks for taking a question here and congrats on a really outstanding quarter and year. The question I had was maybe just follow-up on something you talked a little bit about on your Analyst Day meeting or Investor Day. And you've touched on here, I think in terms of investments to kind of support identifying patients and so on. And Mike, you talked a while back about tracking patients to the system. It sounds like maybe part of the investments you've made around cardio care or helping to do that. I think if I understand them correctly, it may be if you could just talk about, how that's going, how widely you you've rolled that out and to what degree you're employing, are there other types of technology to help you kind of support this growth and identify these patients?","Mike Mussallem","Yes thanks, Matt. And you know what Scott started going down this path. There's three broad, or a few broad categories here. One is educating patients themselves, other is trying to help the referral pathway, be better educated, that continues to be a priority for us. We also have a team that helps systems and have better echo findings and make sure that their referral pathways actually work. We have a benchmark program that allows centers to operate at maximum efficiency. So it's pretty broad base as Scott mentioned, we've got a new initiative with the American Heart Association. It\u2019s broad based, I'd rather be trying detail here, you should know that that is an area of new investment.","Matt Miksic","That's great. That's great. And then just one follow-up if I could on the -- moving into early feasibility study for EVOQUE, if you could maybe just give us a sense of what should we expect in terms of an early enrollment at some of these mitral programs? It takes a little while and what should we think about in terms of maybe getting that enrolled and maybe getting to a point where we'll be seeing some data from that program?","Mike Mussallem","Enrollment cadence looks like, we're excited about the technology. But we're not in a position yet where we're going to disclose timelines or predict how these early stage early feasibility studies and ultimately pivotal trials are going to enroll.","Matt Miksic","Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have exhausted our allotted time for questions. I'll now turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Thank you.","Mike Mussallem","Thanks for your continued interest in Edwards and Scott, Mark and I welcome any additional questions.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to your host, David Erickson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please begin.","David Erickson","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our third quarter 2018 financial results. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A.","Our presenters on today\u2019s call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Scott Ullem, CFO.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during today\u2019s call we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include but aren\u2019t limited to financial guidance, expectations for product opportunities, clinical trials, litigation, new product approvals, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today.","Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in our press release, our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, all of which are available on our website at Edwards.com.","Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying, organic and adjusted, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s press release and our website.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael Mussallem","Thank you, David. We\u2019re pleased to report strong third quarter adjusted sales of $921 million, or a 11% growth on an underlying basis consistent with our expectations, driven by a remarkable portfolio of innovative technologies.","Year-to-date, underlying sales growth was 10%, and it was consistent with our full-year guidance of 10% to 11%. And even with the backdrop of a tough fourth quarter comparison, we expect 2018 to be a year of strong financial performance, while also aggressively investing in our future.","Looking forward, based on recent learnings, we have increased confidence that our innovative lifesaving therapies can benefit many more patients whose structural heart disease is deadly and undertreated today.","In transcatheter heart valve therapy, global third quarter sales were $558 million. Underlying sales were up 12.7% compared to the prior year, which reflects continued impressive organic growth. We estimate global TAVR procedures continued to grow robustly in the mid-teens.","Our worldwide sales grew at a lower rate due to a modest year-over-year share decline outside the U.S. and lower royalty revenues. Globally, our average selling price remained stable.","In the U.S., total procedures for the third quarter grew in the mid-teens versus the prior year, and our growth was comparable. Growth was highest in newer and smaller centers, where this therapy is increasingly accessible to a broader population of aortic stenosis patients.","Based on our continued research, we are increasingly confident that there are many patients who would benefit from TAVR who are not diagnosed or treated today. We\u2019re continuing our efforts to increase awareness, improve diagnosis and help patients receive the care specified in medical guidelines.","Late in the third quarter, we began enrolling our limited Continued Access Protocol, or CAP, for our U.S. PARTNER 3 trial, which have a minimal impact on this quarter\u2019s results. And we continue to anticipate data from the PARTNER 3 trial to be presented at the ACC meeting in March of 2019, followed by the receipt of a low-risk indication late that year.","Earlier this month, we announced the commencement of the U.S. pivotal trial that will study our self-expanding CENTERA transcatheter valve for patients at intermediate risk of open-heart surgery. And we expect the SAPIEN 3 Ultra system to gain U.S. regulatory approval around the end of the year.","Following a public comment period and a review of TAVR outcomes at the Medicare Advisory Committee meeting in July, CMS is currently in the process of formulating a draft provision of the National Coverage Determination, or NCD. This reconsideration is critically important for U.S. patient seeking treatment for this deadly disease.","We assume any changes to the current NCD are likely to significantly affect the global TAVR opportunity. We expect the new NCD to be finalized by June 2019. Outside the U.S., procedure showed significant continued growth estimated to be in the mid-teens. Our procedures grew in the low double digits. We continue to see excellent long-term opportunities for growth, as we believe international adoption of TAVR therapy is still low.","In Europe, we estimate the TAVR procedures grew at an impressive mid-teens rate spread across \u2013 spread broadly across most countries. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced some expected share loss. However, our share stabilized this quarter compared to last quarter.","This quarter, we are implementing a targeted commercial introduction in Europe of our feature-rich CENTERA platform, which demonstrated outstanding clinical outcomes in its early experience. And we remain on track to receive a CE Mark of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra system in the fourth quarter.","We\u2019ve decided to implement a controlled rollout strategy of Ultra, including training to ensure high procedural success of this advanced valve and delivery system and now expected to have a minimal impact on results this year.","In an unrelated development earlier today, we announced that a court in Germany granted a preliminary injunction on future commercial sales of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra valve in that country. The decision does not impact sales of our SAPIEN 3 or CENTERA valves or the clinical study for European approval of SAPIEN 3 Ultra. We will promptly appeal.","In Japan, we continue to see strong TAVR therapy adoption, driven by SAPIEN 3 and new centers continue to be qualified. This is our fastest growing region this quarter, where we believe aortic stenosis still remains a large untreated disease.","In summary, year-to-date underlying sales growth for THVT is 12.5%, and we would expect full-year 2018 to be in that area because of a limited contribution from Cardioband, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment and a revised rollout strategy for SAPIEN 3 Ultra. We\u2019re encouraged that the TAVR opportunity remains robust and we\u2019re confident in our new product offerings to sustain our strong global leadership position.","In Surgical Valve Therapy, underlying sales for the third quarter was $199 million, up 3% on an underlying basis consistent with our expectations. Growth was driven by solid aortic unit volume and continued adoption of our new premium aortic valves.","With the approval of reimbursement, we\u2019re pleased to announce that we began launching our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve in Japan last month. We expect strong adoption of this new class of resilient tissue valves in this important region. This valve is designed to be an attractive option for active patients when we\u2019ve observed a trend of physicians treating younger patients in our early global experience.","In summary, in surgical heart valve therapy, we continue to expect full-year 2018 underlying sales growth of 2% to 4%. Even as TAVR adoption expands, we are excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and to extend our global leadership in surgical heart valve technologies.","In Critical Care, our sales for the quarter were $164 million and grew 15% on an underlying basis. This performance was strong across all our product lines, led primarily by demand for HemoSphere. Sales in the U.S. were particularly robust this quarter, additionally aided by new group purchasing organization contracts.","HemoSphere, our next generation all-in-one monitoring platform that is replacing our older monitoring systems continue to receive excellent feedback from clinicians. HemoSphere is designed to provide greater clarity on a patient\u2019s hemodynamic status. This new monitor is expected to continue to be an important growth driver, although hospital capital replacement cycles can be somewhat unpredictable.","We continue to introduce our Acumen Hypotension Predictive Index, or HPI, to a limited number of hospitals utilizing our current platform until it becomes available on HemoSphere, which is expected in the fourth quarter. This first-of-a-kind technology leverages predictive analytics to alert clinicians of dangerous hypotension or low blood pressure before it occurs in their surgical patients.","In summary, due to excitement by early adopters of HemoSphere 2018 is turning out to be a particularly strong year for Critical Care. We now expect 2018 underlying sales growth to exceed the top end of our full-year guidance range of 6% to 8%.","Turning to our Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies, or TMTT, we continue to invest aggressively in our portfolio of therapies. As you\u2019ve heard last month at TCT, the results of the COAPT trial clearly demonstrated the importance of reducing mitral regurgitation, reinforcing confidence in our strategy to address this large opportunity. There were also updates on our TMTT programs, and you can expect a more complete overview of our portfolio at our Investor Conference in December.","Today, I will cover some select updates. Beginning with transcatheter mitral repair, patients continue to be treated commercially in Europe with Cardioband, and we\u2019re encouraged by the high level of interest from clinicians in its potential. Third quarter sales were limited to $1 million due to the ongoing supply constraint, our \u2013 in both our mitral and tricuspid programs, and we expect that trend to continue in the fourth quarter.","In order to fortify our near-term supply and scale for longer-term volume expectations, we\u2019ve decided to transfer production of this platform from the facility that we acquired to other Edwards manufacturing locations. We expect Cardioband supply constraints to progressively improve throughout 2019. We believe as this therapy advances, the annular reduction provided by Cardioband can be an important first-line treatment for many mitral patients.","We continue to receive variable clinician feedback on our PASCAL mitral repair therapy and still expect the European launch of this platform in 2019. In the U.S., we\u2019re pleased to announce the approval of our pivotal trial to study patients with primary mitral regurgitation and are in the process of securing hospital contracts.","In mitral valve replacement, we\u2019re encouraged by the positive scientific presentations of TCT last month on our new EVOQUE system, which is built on the learnings and experiences of CardiAQ. We continue to make good clinical progress with EVOQUE and SAPIEN M3 systems and remain confident in our transseptal mitral replacement strategy.","In transcatheter tricuspid repair, again, constrained by supply, clinicians continue to treat a limited number of patients in Europe with our Cardioband Tricuspid Annular Reduction System and we\u2019ve received positive feedback on this therapy. In the U.S., we have initiated our early feasibility study.","Overall, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities for our transcatheter therapies to help patients who are suffering from mitral and tricuspid valve disease and we continue to expect a large global opportunity.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Ullem","Thank you, Mike. I\u2019m pleased to report another quarter of double-digit underlying sales growth. Adjusted sales were $921 million, up 11% over 2017. These results were in line with our expectations in our typical third quarter seasonality.","Consistent with our practice in the prior two quarters, adjusted sales exclude a sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for surgical valves in the United States, which was $14 million this quarter. We still expect to complete the conversion by year-end and now estimate the conversion will impact sales by approximately $80 million to $90 million this year.","Adjusted earnings per share was $1.07 and GAAP earnings per share was $1.06. Adjusted EPS growth was 27%, which benefited from a lower tax rate, driven by U.S. tax reform and solid growth and operating income. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.02 higher this quarter than it would have been if the excess tax benefit was as we estimated in our guidance last quarter.","For the quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.5%, compared to 74.4% in the same period last year. This improvement primarily reflects the benefit of a more profitable product mix and the absence of last year\u2019s expenses associated with Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. These benefits were partially offset by continued investments and manufacturing capacity. We continue to expect our full-year 2018 gross profit margin, excluding special items to be between 74% and 76%.","Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses. Third quarter expenses increased 10% over the prior year to $270 million, or 29.7% of sales. This increase was driven by personnel related expenses. The ratio of SG&A as a percentage of sales would have been 40 basis points lower if you exclude the impact of the HVT consignment conversion. We continue to expect full-year SG&A, excluding special items to be between 28% and 29% of sales.","Research and development investments in the quarter increased 13% over the prior year to $162 million, or 17.8% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter programs, including spending on clinical trials. We continue to expect R&D, excluding special items to be between 16% and 17% of sales for the full-year.","Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 9.2%, down from 19.7% in the prior year period. This reduction was driven primarily by U.S. tax reform. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 490 basis points from the accounting for employee stock-based compensation, which was 190 basis points higher than we estimated in our guidance last quarter.","Excluding the impact from special items, our tax rate this quarter was 13.5%. We continue to expect our full-year tax rate, excluding special items to be at the low-end of our previous range of 13% to 16%.","Foreign exchange rates decreased third quarter sales growth by $7 million, or 0.9% compared to the prior year. At current rates, we continue to expect an approximate $30 million lift, or about 1% to full-year 2018 sales compared to the prior year. Compared to our July guidance, FX rates benefited earnings per share by about a $0.01 this quarter, reflecting the effective currency hedging program we have in place.","Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $257 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $342 million, less capital expenditures of $85 million. Our year-to-date adjusted free cash flow, which excludes last quarter\u2019s tax audit settlements and repatriation taxes, was $550 million.","Turning to the balance sheet. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion, and we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.6 billion. Just after the end of the quarter, we retired maturing bonds, which reduced both of these amounts by about $600 million.","Now turning to our 2018 guidance. For the full-year, as we discussed earlier, we are now modeling slightly lower transcatheter heart valve therapy sales and higher critical care sales. For the total company, our prior guidance ranges are unchanged as we continue to expect to achieve the higher-end of each of the current sales guidance ranges of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion for transcatheter heart valve therapy, $810 million to $850 million for surgical heart valve therapy and $610 million to $650 million for critical care, and for total Edwards $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion.","Our prior guidance ranges for adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow are also unchanged. We continue to expect our full-year adjusted EPS to be between $4.60 and $4.75. Lastly, we continue to expected adjusted free cash flow to be at the higher-end of $700 million to $775 million.","For the fourth quarter of 2018 at current foreign exchange rates, we project adjusted sales to be between $950 million and $1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.05 and $1.20.","And with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Mike.","Michael Mussallem","Thanks, Scott. We remain confident in our outlook for continued strong sales growth and are passionate about helping more patients around the world. We continue to focus on driving organic growth with leading innovative technologies, while aggressively investing in our future.","Our foundation of leadership, coupled with our robust product pipeline positions us well for continued longer-term success and greater shareholder value, as we pursue multibillion market opportunities.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to David.","David Erickson","Thank you, Mike. Before we open it for questions, I would like to remind you to mark your calendars for the evening of Tuesday December 4th, and the morning of Wednesday December 5th, when we will be hosting our 2018 Investor Conference at our corporate headquarters here in Irvine, California.","This event will include discussions with key opinion leaders, updates on our latest technologies and views on longer-term market potential, as well as our outlook for 2019. More information will be available in the coming weeks.","We\u2019re ready to take questions now. In order to allow broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and we\u2019ll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the call. Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Larry Biegelsen","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. One on 2019 legal question. So Mike and Scott, I know you won\u2019t provide 2019 guidance until the Investor Conference in December. But you\u2019ve always been helpful in providing some puts and takes looking at the following year.","I think consensus is modeling about 10% revenue growth next year, which is similar to the underlying sales growth you\u2019re getting to this year. It does seem like there\u2019s more tailwinds in 2019 than 2018, which should help and the Street\u2019s modeling about 12% EPS growth. So is there anything you would call out there? And I had one follow-up.","Michael Mussallem","Yes, Larry. You\u2019ve kind of answered your own question. We\u2019re not in a position to provide 2019 guidance until we get to the Investor Conference. But I mean, if we just want to think big picture, our TAVR business is healthy, and we continue to expect mid-teens growth in that marketplace through 2021 and beyond for that matter. And we know AS is dramatically undertreated.","And when you couple that with this comprehensive TMTT portfolio with some very nice mid to longer-term growth opportunities, we think it provides a very positive backdrop. We\u2019re committed to win in that space and we\u2019ve been aggressively invested. And we just have continued confidence in our innovation strategy. So we\u2019ll get into the numbers later, Larry. but I think we have nothing specific to share at this time.","Larry Biegelsen","Okay, I understand. So Mike, let me push my luck a little bit and ask a legal question. I spoke with an investor today, he said, \u201cI love what Edwards is doing in transcatheter heart valves, and I\u2019d like to buy this stock.\u201d But frankly, I\u2019m concerned Boston could potentially enjoy in both SAPIEN 3 and Ultra in Germany any day. And I know you\u2019re appealing those decisions, but in the meantime, Boston does have that option. So Mike, if you were speaking to that investor, how would you relay his or her concern? Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael Mussallem","Well, I think big picture, you know that Boston Scientific has initiated litigation and involves a number of patents in multiple countries and is likely to yield a number of court actions over an extended period of time. The recent developments have not changed our view that Boston\u2019s patents are invalid and we\u2019re confident in our leading intellectual property position.","Larry Biegelsen","Got it. Thank you for taking the questions.","Michael Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed.","Jason Mills","Hi, Mike, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to Larry\u2019s question about puts and takes. What we\u2019ve seen thus far in 2018 and frankly for the last 18 months are trials that would suggest that the low-risk opportunity for you in TAVR is meaningful and could be material to growth rates for the marketplace. The LRT trial from Washington Hospital Center comes to mind recently. And there are other puts and takes obviously with some of your product launches and seemingly perhaps having more impact on 2019 and 2018.","So I guess, if we just stick with the market growth rates and sort of your share trends, both in the United States and Europe, would you anticipate that the goings on with respect to trials and low-risk over the next six to 12 months, as well as new market entrants, Boston in the United States, sort of offset by your product launches would create an environment, where market growth rates are still strong, maybe commensurate with what we\u2019ve seen this year and you can maintain share over that time?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, Jason, it\u2019s a good question. As I said, we continue to be confident about the long-term growth prospects for TAVR. But as you correctly surmised, I think, this data that\u2019s going to come out related to the low-risk indication has the potential to be some kind of a catalyst.","As we said before probably not a step function, but a net positive to a market that\u2019s already growing quite nicely. As we\u2019ve talked before, our pricing has been quite stable. And so the question comes back to share, but it\u2019s share of a rapidly growing market and we\u2019re pretty confident in our position. I mean, it\u2019s absolutely true that we\u2019re going to have new competition, but at the same time 2019 is going to the first year that we have real impacts from our Ultra valve and CENTERA.","Jason Mills","Okay, it\u2019s helpful. And then on the mitral side, Mike, you were asked several questions at the TCT meeting about COAPT. And I\u2019m wondering with the benefit of an extra month or so since that trial was presented? If you have any different or augmented perspective on how COAPT may or may not change the landscape in mitral? And maybe more specifically how fast these trials enroll, whether it would be your PASCAL study uptick in Europe of Cardioband and PASCAL?","And then also on the replacement side, what COAPT may or may not do with respect to excitement around our clinical trial enrollment in those studies if you have a couple going on I know?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, Jason. As you correctly pointed out, we\u2019ve got quite a bit going on in the mitral space and we\u2019re excited about the new developments. The results of COAPT clearly demonstrated the importance of reducing mitral regurgitation. And it does reinforce our confidence in our strategy to try and address this opportunity that\u2019s very large.","We\u2019re just- we\u2019re enthusiastic about the transcatheter therapies to help patients that are suffering in these areas. So we feel good about it. It can\u2019t hurt enrollment, that\u2019s for sure. It should facilitate that, both on the PASCAL side and our other clinical trials that we have ahead.","Jason Mills","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","David Lewis","Good afternoon. Mike, just two questions for you. First, just on Cardioband. In my sense as you reiterated sort of the $15 million contribution at TCT. So could you just talk about when the decision on manufacturing was reached? Should we assume basically zero revenue for Cardioband in the fourth quarter? And as you think about next year, you talked about scaling up manufacturing. Is $15 million a better way thinking about 2019, or is that sort of conservative relative to how you see the manufacturing scale-up next year? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Michael Mussallem","Yes. Well, thanks, David. You\u2019re right, we\u2019re more and more optimistic about being able to scale-up Cardioband and now we expect that to change. We fell short of our goals of our current supply base and also the acquired facility. And so we\u2019ve already begun this process to begin the transition to other facilities.","As I mentioned in prepared remarks, we expect the supply constraints to progressively improve throughout 2019, and we\u2019d expect the manufacturing transition probably to finish by the end of the year. So it\u2019s premature for us to be able to actually estimate numbers, David, but hopefully that gives you a sense of the direction and the rationale why.","Scott Ullem","Hey, David, it\u2019s Scott. I just add. In terms of contributions to Q4, it\u2019s not going to be zero, but it\u2019s probably going to look something more like what we did in Q3, maybe $1 million or somewhere in that range.","David Lewis","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Mike, the \u2013 obviously, the biggest update in this call was the decision to move forward with the U.S. pivotal for PASCAL. So, can you just talk about the decision in the company and move forward on primary MR, and what the structure of that trial is going to look like? Thanks so much.","Michael Mussallem","Yes. So the \u2013 this trial, what we call the trial class is one where we\u2019re going to be studying primary mitral regurgitation. It\u2019s going to be a two to one randomization versus MitraClip and it\u2019s going to be by \u2013 for patients that are deemed inoperable by the local heart team.","So the same way the MitraClip is labeled today. It will be a non-inferiority study around 300 patients at 50 centers primary endpoint MR grade reduction and then secondary endpoint of major adverse events.","David Lewis","Okay. Thanks so much.","Michael Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon, and thank you, guys. I wanted to start with a question on pricing. I think, you guys mentioned in your prepared comments that the global pricing dynamic for TAVR has been stable. But I\u2019m interested in sort what went on in the quarter competitively? I think that\u2019s been a topic of interest all year long. It seems like your competitors are still pretty active in fighting for market share in various ways. So I\u2019d be interested in if you could put some color on what\u2019s going on in pricing? What\u2019s assumed in the rest of the year for your guidance on that topic? Thank you.","Michael Mussallem","Yes. Isaac, thanks. Yes, you\u2019re right. We did mention in prepared remarks that global average selling price remains stable, and we would expect that condition to continue in 2018. That\u2019s been very steady for sometime to come. I know that we had some conversations last quarter about some aggressive pricing that we saw in Europe.","We probably, although there continues to be a significant difference between Edwards pricing and our competitors. That\u2019s probably sell down a little bit. And we look from a share perspective to believe that it\u2019s probably stabilized versus the quarter before. So I don\u2019t know if that helps get an extra question.","Isaac Ro","Yes, sure. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on your comments for the MEDCAC panel outcome. There has been obviously a lot of debate about, if that \u2013 how the NCD gets updated? What that means for the marketplace in TAVR overall? I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand your reasoning as to why you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got a lot of meaningful impact, at least, initially and how you think that will play out over time? Thank you.","Michael Mussallem","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I think big picture, CMS is taking a look at our what\u2019s going on in TAVR from a reimbursement perspective and consider that a success. So although the NCD needs updating and it will be updated. We don\u2019t expect right now for it \u2013 for whatever happens to have a significant impact on the TAVR opportunity. Now, of course, depending on what they decide, it could have some influence up or down. But we\u2019re just trying to share with you that when we do our own modeling, we\u2019re kind of modeling no significant change.","Isaac Ro","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So maybe I wanted to start one with the 2019 drivers, obviously, given where we are in the year, I think, all eyes are turned to 2019. When I think about the negatives, right, Mike, the \u2013 obviously, you have pricing pressure ongoing in Europe and you have a new competitor coming into the U.S. at some point, possibly mid of next year. But on the other side, you have low-risk approval Cardioband ramping up and PASCAL launching. I don\u2019t think you commented on the timing of PASCAL launch and we\u2019re just assuming mid of 2019, and the base case seems to be one offsets the other. Is that any reason why TAVR growth in 2019 could be below 2018 levels that you could think of?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. So I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re looking at the negative, so we look at the future and we\u2019re pretty positive about it. The pricing pressure in Europe is something that we\u2019ve dealt with for a long time. That\u2019s been there and we\u2019re excited about having new products in the future. And although we won\u2019t have a big impact on Q4, it will have impact going forward.","The U.S. approval has been somewhat inevitable that there was going to be that competition that we kind of fully accounted for that. We\u2019re going to be excited about bringing CENTERA and Ultra to the U.S. as well.","In terms of the upside on TMTT and some of those, we\u2019re not prepared yet to talk about when we\u2019re going to launch PASCAL in terms of what time of the year, but it\u2019s going to be positive. But you also have to remember that THV, the aortic business is a much larger business and has more influence on our near-term \u2013 probably our 2019 sales.","Vijay Kumar","And that\u2019s helpful, Mike. And then maybe one if I could on the Cardioband, the active trials. I think, there are some debate post \u2013 COAPT, whether it needs to be designed and we\u2019ve spoken to some people. And I just, the feedback seems to be the Cardioband or the annuloplasty patient population is very different from the clip [ph] patient population. If that thesis or assumption is true, then you may not need to redesign the Cardioband trial, you could do a device versus a drug trial.","So I guess, I want to know, one, if the Street is thinking annuloplasty Cardioband is dead, how right or how wrong is the Street on those assumptions and \u2013 versus the trial design does it need to be changed? Any comments, I think, would be helpful.","Michael Mussallem","So, we \u2013 the big picture for us, we continue to get a positive feedback and our belief is that annular reduction that\u2019s provided by Cardioband could be a really important for first-line therapy. Again, it\u2019s going to require some advancements on our part, but we continue to feel strongly about that.","In terms of the future implications of the active trial, post-COAPT, we are assessing the implications of clinical trial design based on what was learned in that. And we hope that we\u2019re going to have more to share with you about that when we get to our Investor Conference in December.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks, guys.","Michael Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Raj Denhoy","Hi, good afternoon. I wonder if I could maybe just dig a little bit on Europe. I think, you mentioned that, that you you did see some share loss early in the year, but it\u2019s stable at this point. I\u2019m curious if you can confirm that, and really anything you can give us just in terms of the dynamics in Europe as we sit here today?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. I think, as we indicated last quarter, we felt like we experienced some share loss and so we continue. That share loss has happened, and so it continues to be reflected in our year-over-year growth rates. What we\u2019re saying is sequentially share seemed to stabilize from our perspective. So this was \u2013 so we\u2019re saying, we didn\u2019t see it as a continued trend that continued into the third quarter. Does that get at your question, Raj?","Raj Denhoy","It does. Yes, it doesn\u2019t. And I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s anything more you can offer in terms of where that was? Was it specific accounts or why you did experience a share loss and why you don\u2019t expect it\u2019s going to get any worse even in Europe?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m able to do that. I mean, this is a pretty vast kind of \u2013 a lot of countries, a lot of moving parts here. I think it\u2019s just generally true. Even when we think back to what happened in Q2, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s widespread. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of procedures to change the actual results in transcatheter heart valves.","Raj Denhoy","Okay, fair. Maybe just from my follow-up. Just you mentioned that you\u2019re not going to look at more of a measured rollout for Ultra in Europe. And I\u2019m curious why that is? If there\u2019s something about that valve, you think you need to go a bit slower now as you roll that out?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. Well, it\u2019s a good question. So we learned with experience that Ultra system is different from SAPIEN 3. And we wanted to ensure that we had \u2013 that we ensured our own high-performance through training. Remember, we took steps out of the procedure with Ultra amounting to valve on the balloon rather than alignment in the aorta, the Excel sheet is an improvement, but it also benefits from additional training. So we just wanted to make sure that we maintain this very high level of performance as we roll this out knowing that it\u2019s a different valve and that became apparent to us through our own experience.","Raj Denhoy","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank Of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks very much and good afternoon.","Michael Mussallem","Good afternoon.","Bob Hopkins","I just want to ask a couple of questions, Mike, on PASCAL. First of all, can you just give us a sense as to the first time that you\u2019ll see data from any PASCAL trial. I assume the first data would be from the European study. So when will we see some of that data?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. We would guess that it would be mid-next year when data will really be available on PASCAL.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. And then also, Mike, maybe this is my misunderstanding. But I\u2019m just curious about your U.S. PASCAL trial strategy focusing on primary MR. What\u2019s the strategy for focusing on secondary MR, which is obviously the bigger market opportunity and the one that create all the attention at TCT. So what\u2019s the strategy on secondary?","Michael Mussallem","Yes, I mean, obviously, it\u2019s on our radar screen. We don\u2019t have anything specific to report at this point. I will probably have more to say about that when we get to the Investor Conference, Bob. But you\u2019re right, that\u2019s an important patient population as well. But we didn\u2019t want to hold up on getting \u2013 moving forward with our existing trial.","Bob Hopkins","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please proceed.","Rick Wise","Good afternoon, Mike. Let me come back to your comments on the \u2013 now the controlled launch for both the new TAVR and CENTERA and Ultra. Is this the new norm using going forward we should generally assume? And it makes sense, I get it, to release more slowly. And maybe you could help us understand what controlled means? Does it mean to receptors? Does it mean that it will take you six months to sort of get your sea legs as it were, or no, this is a process that it could take a couple of years. Can you help us better frame and the thinking behind all that?","Michael Mussallem","Yes, I don\u2019t know it\u2019s the new norm. We certainly feel responsible. We are going to customers and offering systems that we think are improvements over systems that already have some very high performance. So you know the way that SAPIEN 3 is performed in big data sets.","And so we feel the obligation to make sure that the next generations of systems whether it\u2019s CENTERA or Ultra, continue to perform at least at that level or better. And so we just want to make sure that we invest the time to do that. For the most part, I expect this training to be done by our clinical specialists. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to start reproctoring patients again, but we do feel like we want people to slowdown and recognize, hey, there\u2019s a number of advancements in these systems, let\u2019s really focus on them, understand them well, so that you get great performance right from first patient.","Rick Wise","All right. And maybe a question for Scott. Scott, you highlighted that capacity investments in anticipation of growth in new products. Maybe talk about what that \u2013 how long that spending is going to go on? When you think that\u2019s completed? And how that affects, if at all, the ramp for these new products?","Scott Ullem","All right. So we\u2019ve been investing and increasing our capacity now for a couple of years. And remember, we were supply constrained, and so we had some catching up to do just to support THV. Now we\u2019re ramping up to also support an expansion in TMTT. And so we\u2019ve been making investments in our existing facilities in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.","And as you know, we\u2019re working on building a new facility in Costa Rica and just announced a plan earlier this year to put a facility in Ireland. And so I think that spending and investment is going to continue for a number of years down the road. You\u2019ve seen it reflected in our higher capital expenditure investments. We\u2019d probably be over $200 million this year. And the result is going to be that we will be able to satisfy the needs for really addressing these large untapped markets and years ahead.","Rick Wise","Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Glenn Novarro","Hi, good afternoon. Hey, Mike, I know you don\u2019t want to give guidance for 2019. But as I think about what I\u2019m hearing on this call a slower rollout of SAPIEN Ultra in 2019 and hopefully some positive benefits later in the year from PARTNER 3. So should one assume, as we build our models for 2019, kind of a slower first-half and a stronger second-half? And I know the comps are going to be a little bit easier as well. So maybe some color on kind of how we should think about 20109 and U.S. TAVR ramp? Thanks.","Michael Mussallem","Yes, thanks. I think, you\u2019ve got the right idea. I do think you should more think of ramp rather than step function in 2019. And you\u2019re right, whether it\u2019s the way we roll out new products or the way the products \u2013 or the way that physicians and the rest of the marketplace absorb the low risk data.","We think this is going to happen in a gradual fashion rather than sort of a jump. So yes, I think it\u2019s reasonable to think about that. Remember, the low risk approval itself doesn\u2019t come until late in 2019.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. And then just as my follow-up, just to clarify PASCAL in Europe. Can you just remind us where you are in enrolling that trial? And can you give us some specifics as to when in 2019 you think you\u2019ll be launching in Europe? Thanks.","Michael Mussallem","Yes. We\u2019ve resisted giving specifics on 2019. We\u2019re right on track on that trial, so we\u2019re continuing to enroll patients. And so that it\u2019s right where we want it to be and so we expect to be launching in 2019. But at the Investor Conference, we may have more detail for you, Glenn.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. Can I sneak in one more for Scott. Scott, can you give us just ballpark for next year where the tax rate is? We\u2019re modeling an uptick, but is it 200, 300 bps, anything in the ballpark for the tax rate next year would be helpful? Thanks.","Scott Ullem","Yes, we\u2019re reluctant to do that at this point. And I can say that it\u2019s a lot lower than we would have expected at the beginning of this year. As you know, we\u2019re looking at the lower-end of a 13% to 16% rate for the full-year 2018, but I\u2019m reluctant to get into any more than.","Keep in mind, one of the big influences on our tax rate is this excess tax benefit that we received from the premium on employee stock-based, performance-based options. And so that\u2019s a variable that we\u2019ll be able to estimate a little bit better maybe when we get to the Investor Conference in December.","Glenn Novarro","Okay, great. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Bruce Nudell","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question, Mike. You\u2019ve had some commercial experience with CENTERA in Europe. And just given all the discussions about pricing, are you seeing that the customer appeal of CENTERA is up to your expectations?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. I mean, our experience has been that the customers who have tried CENTERA really like it. It\u2019s feature-rich and we frankly sense a lot of excitement. And so the early feedback has been very strong on that system. And even the early feedback in the U.S. is quite positive for those people that are in the trial.","Bruce Nudell","And my follow-up is on COAPT. I mean, I listened to your comments today from last quarter. And you explicitly said, you don\u2019t expect \u2013 people dare to hope for a mortality benefit, but you got both mortality and a rehospitalization benefit and in a very convincing way. And before you\u2019d said, this market be $3 billion in 2025. Actually, we\u2019ll be thinking about it now that we actually have that very important clinical proof-of-concept?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. I know you\u2019re right about that, we have shown confidence and this being, as we said, our $1 billion and our $3 billion projections in the past and we haven\u2019t backed off on that and here\u2019s the COAPT trial that is very impressive and I think even surprised us. So we\u2019re thinking about that deeply, Bruce.","We don\u2019t have anything to share at this point. I mean, we would be able to get people with you in terms of mitral models when we get to the Investor Conference. I guess, we\u2019re starting to feel a little bit like a broken record, but we\u2019re in the process of studying that now.","Bruce Nudell","Thanks very much.","Michael Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Joanne Wuensch","Good evening, and thank you for taking my question. One of the things that investors frequently ask us is, how much or how many of the low-risk patient pool has been already penetrated with sort of the shifting labeling of STS as not necessarily the metric for defining low versus intermediate-risk. There\u2019s sort of segues into the OG shocks [ph] can low-risk really help them next year? How would you respond to that?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. We don\u2019t think there has been any significant penetration of this low risk group. We believe that our customers largely stay on label and it\u2019s because it\u2019s backed up by the NCD. And again, the NCD is very clear about what will be paid for and the stakes are quite high to go off-base from that perspective.","Having said that, the whole designation of risk categorization by various patient groups, I think, it\u2019s going to become an obsolete notion once PARTNER 3 is out there. The \u2013 there\u2019s not going to be this question of, gee, how risky is it for patients to go through surgery? We believe that we\u2019re going to have a trial that demonstrates that TAVR is substantially equivalent to surgery for all patients at this point, at least, the groups that have been studied and it\u2019s going to be more about anatomy that it is about risk.","So we think the conversation is going to change. I think we believe it\u2019s going to be helpful to have that PARTNER 3 data, probably the last really big transcatheter aortic valves study done in patients with severe aortic stenosis and symptoms.","Joanne Wuensch","And my second question has to do with product timelines. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get a full update in December. But can you give us an update on where you are with FORMA. If memory serves, you\u2019ve paused to that clinical trial or product development? Thank you.","Michael Mussallem","Yes, thanks. So we had some procedural learnings as we rolled out FORMA, and that led to system enhancements. And we resumed treating patients on a compassionate basis with the new FORMA system and we\u2019re pleased with that. But it\u2019s still early experience with the revised system.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you.","Michael Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please proceed.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. Mike, first on Cardioband. I just wanted to confirm that this is an issue with the facility and not with the product. Is the fix here really just the location change or are there things you need to tweak about the product design itself to make it more manufacturable?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. No, we\u2019re really talking about fixing comply \u2013 supply constraints, Chris. If your question is, is there an issue with the performance or with the demand? I mean that we believe that the demand has been there. We\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve got a lot of suppliers on that system. There has been a lot of integration into the Edwards system and this has been significantly. But recall, we\u2019re always innovating and we\u2019re going to improve the system over time.","But the supply constraints that I\u2019m talking about are not related to some overall performance shortcoming, but just our ability to supply at the level that we\u2019d like to at the quality level we want to.","Chris Pasquale","Yes. And just to clarify, not talking about clinical performance, but just the manufacturability of the product itself, it\u2019s too hard to make or is it just a problem with where it was being made?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. So, when you get into these kind of things, of course, we have many, many suppliers in that system. They wouldn\u2019t be typical Edward suppliers and they\u2019re also in a very small facility in Israel that\u2019s not very typical to what Edwards would employ. We just feel like we need to make migration of both \u2013 some of the suppliers in the manufacturing facility itself. So that we feel confident, both in boosting the near-term and fortifying the supply and also being able to scale us for our long-term expectations.","Chris Pasquale","That\u2019s helpful. And then just quickly on Critical Care, can you talk a little bit about how you frame the opportunity for HemoSphere? The business grew 15% this quarter, that\u2019s something that you should get noticed a little bit. Should we be thinking about that as a very short-term upgrade cycle you\u2019re going through right now, or could double-digit growth in that business actually be sustainable for a while?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. I mean, we\u2019re really pleased with what\u2019s going on in Critical Care. And you\u2019re right, HemoSphere has been very popular with customers and these early adopters have really boosted our sales growth rate. Now we did get a little bit help this year for some group purchasing organization contract. The HemoSphere has been the one that\u2019s really driven this. It\u2019s part of what we\u2019re benefiting from is a capital replacement cycle as it replaces our existing monitors.","Overall, we\u2019re not deep into that replacement cycle at this point. It\u2019s hard for us to predict what this is going to look like. And so, yes, it\u2019s tough to say exactly what it\u2019s going to mean for the future growth rates. I wouldn\u2019t automatically anticipate that we\u2019re going to maintain a growth rate like we just enjoyed in the third quarter.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks for taking the question. Scott, maybe some financial housekeeping questions here. Gross margin came in better than expected. Maybe you could help us with the drivers there or hedges included in that? And how we think about FX, both for the balance of the year on the top and bottom line and what your latest count is into 2019?","Michael Mussallem","Sure. As it turns out, gross margin came in right about where we expected, and I think that was a little bit above where someone on the Street, but it was right where we thought it was going to be. It was up over 100 basis points versus the 74.4% in the third quarter 2017 and reflected benefit from improved mix, which we\u2019ve been seeing consistently with the growth of THV, and it also reflected the benefits of not having the recurring expenses that we experienced from Hurricane Maria last year. That is offset a little bit by manufacturing capacity investments that we talked about earlier.","Robbie Marcus","And where FX stands for top and bottom line for this year and next year current rates?","Michael Mussallem","So for FX, we continue to expect that for the full-year, we\u2019ll see about a 1% benefit to sales, or $30 million. At the gross profit line, we\u2019re largely insulated, by the time we get down EPS, it\u2019s about $0.01 benefit in the third quarter. But the gross profit line, it\u2019s tough to predict what the impact is going to be from these hedge outcomes that we realized during the course of the year.","Robbie Marcus","Okay, thanks. And maybe as a follow-up, I haven\u2019t heard any update on Harpoon lately. Maybe you could just give us the way the status of that program? Thanks.","Michael Mussallem","Sure. Last time we talked about it. We said that we are examining the root cause of some of the complications we saw earlier. We haven\u2019t completed that analysis. So we will report to you as soon as we have that completed. We\u2019re hopeful that that\u2019s not going to go on too much longer.","Robbie Marcus","Thank you.","Michael Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Please proceed.","Danielle Antalffy","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Mike, I just have two questions for you. One on U.S. and one on ex-U.S. and litigation. So first on U.S. This is a market that presumably or potentially could be going from two players to four sometime over the next, call it, 18 to 24 months. And I know I\u2019ve asked this before. But just how are you feeling about the sustainability of the pricing environment, particularly in the context of what we\u2019re seeing happen in Europe? And then I just have one follow-up on litigation.","Michael Mussallem","Sure. We have a lot of experience selling heart valves in the U.S. and we wonder whether THV is going to be a lot different than that. It\u2019s a pretty heavy lift to be able to get our product approved in the U.S. market. And we think largely our competitors are disciplined pricers, especially with all the work that\u2019s necessary and clinical investment necessary to come to the U.S. market.","So we\u2019re not overly concerned. We \u2013 in our long-term models, we model a modest price decline, but we don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be anything that\u2019s dramatic. For the most part, when we do our own pricing, we do some discounting based on volume, right?","Danielle Antalffy","Okay.","Michael Mussallem","Yes.","Danielle Antalffy","Okay, got it. And then just last question here for me. Appreciating that you\u2019re not going to necessarily comment on the ongoing litigation. But let\u2019s just assume, I understand that Ultra is certainly advanced. But I\u2019m curious about how you feel about your competitive positioning for SAPIEN 3 with or without the advance of Ultra. I guess, I am trying to get it assuming Ultra does get enjoined. It feels to me like there\u2019s no reason to think there should be any significant shift in market share for SAPIEN 3 from here. But tell me if you think I\u2019m thinking about that wrong?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. I mean, we\u2019re really pleased. I think, SAPIEN 3 has clearly demonstrated that it is best-in-class performance, and there\u2019s an awful lot of data that supports that. Our efforts in Ultra was to able to do that and do it even better and be able to have some advantages for physicians and patients that go along with that. So we\u2019re very proud of the SAPIEN 3 platform and feel good about where it stands.","Danielle Antalffy","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Please proceed.","Kristen Stewart","Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Sorry for my voice little under further. I just wanted to circle back just in terms of thinking about kind of the P&L. And just kind of generally your philosophy on how you think about \u2013 I know you\u2019re not giving guidance. I assume you will give explicit guidance at the Analyst Day.","But how do you feel about at this stage and ramping up to support things like mitral and tricuspid, R&D came in a bit heavier this quarter. Is this kind of a new sort of a run rate maybe we should think about 16 or 17 or may be closer to 17 on ongoing rate? And then whether or not there\u2019s additional investments that need to be made from a sales and marketing perspective that\u2019s not really being reflected this year?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, Kristen. Maybe I\u2019ll make a few comments and then let Scott jump in and add additional color. So, big picture, we\u2019re aggressive investors in R&D and we see rich opportunities. We\u2019ve been aggressive, not only in our current portfolio, but also in the new portfolio associated with transcatheter mitral and tricuspid.","I think, our R&D as a percent of sales always looks seasonably high in the third quarter. Remember, we \u2013 this is our \u2013 for at least our company, this is our lowest seasonal quarter. So ratios tend to be a bit deceiving. But nonetheless, we\u2019re going to stay aggressive investors in the space.","Scott Ullem","I just add. We had the benefit of this tax reform in 2018, and so we end up being able to invest even more aggressively and advance some of these programs that we\u2019ve had on deck to really accelerate to ultimately commercialization. And so we\u2019ve been fortunate to be able to fund these programs and to continue to invest for long-term top line organic growth.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. And then, Scott, just a follow-up on the kind of topic of tax, I think, this kind of came up before. But if I look at kind of the year-to-date run rate for the adjusted tax line, how much of that is just related to employee stock compensation? I guess, this quarter was 490. Is that consistent with both full year-to-date and kind of thinking forward to next year, I know you didn\u2019t make comments. But is that something that you typically start out of the year, assuming no benefit?","Scott Ullem","Yes, this is \u2013 it\u2019s really hard to estimate, because as you know, exercises tend to go up when the stock price performs well, and then the tax benefit is even greater, the higher stock price is, so you get this double benefit. The reverse also happens. And so if the stock is not as mobile on the upside, then there may not be as many exercises and the value of those exercise does not flow through to the same degree of the tax rate.","So this year, we\u2019ve \u2013 this quarter, we\u2019ve realized an effective adjusted tax rate of about 13.5%. You mentioned before 490 basis points of that was for \u2013 from the excess tax benefit. But we\u2019ll think more about it and try to give you our call when we get to the Investor Conference for 2019. But this is one that\u2019s tricky. It\u2019s one of the reason why we\u2019ve also started talking about our operating profits and our operating margins just because the bottom line is more volatile as a result of this new accounting practice.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, that makes sense. Thanks very much, guys.","Michael Mussallem","Okay. Well, thanks all for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, David and I welcome any additional questions by telephone.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to David.","David Erickson","Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. David Erickson, Vice President-Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","David K. Erickson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our second quarter 2016 financial results. During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO, and Scott Ullem, CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions, and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and current expectations for clinical, regulatory, reimbursement and commercial matters, as well as therapy trends and foreign currency movements. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today.","Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in our press release, our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our other SEC filings, all of which are available on our website at edwards.com.","Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying and adjusted, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release and on our website.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, David. We're very pleased to report strong second quarter performance, which reflected significant growth in the number of patients and physicians choosing Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy. Our results this quarter were better than expected driving strong top and bottom line growth.","Global sales grew 21% on an underlying basis, reflecting significant Transcatheter Heart Valve sales that once again drove the majority of this quarter's growth, with a solid contribution from Critical Care. In transcatheter heart valves, global sales were $419 million, up 45% on an underlying basis over prior year. Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption across all geographies, with notable strength in the U.S.","Globally, average selling prices remained stable. In the U.S., Transcatheter Heart Valve sales for the quarter were $246 million and grew 66% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Overall procedure growth exceeded our expectations, and strong sales were widespread in both large and small hospitals. Positive clinical results continue to drive adoption, and clinician feedback on the intermediate risk trial data presented at the ACC conference has been consistently positive.","During the quarter, the final intermediate risk data sets were submitted to the FDA and we're awaiting for approval of the expanded indication. Although it's always difficult to predict regulatory timelines, based on the strength of these data, we anticipate that approval will be received during the third quarter.","As a reminder, intermediate risk patients continue to be treated through our Continuous Access Protocol of the PARTNER II trial, which has been tracking at close to $10 million in sales per quarter. This would end as commercial sales begin.","Enrollment in our PARTNER III low-risk trial is underway, and approximately half of our expected trial sites are active. As a reminder, this is a randomized trial and although difficult to estimate, we believe this trial should be enrolled by mid-2017. And, at the request of clinicians, who want to offer this therapy to a broader group of patients, we're revising the trial protocol by removing the 65 years or older age qualification.","Outside the U.S., underlying THV sales grew 23%, driven by the ongoing therapy adoption primarily in Europe, and a contribution from Japan. We are pleased with the adoption seen in Japan following the launch of SAPIEN 3 earlier this year and we expect Japan to be a strong contributor to long-term growth.","In Europe, we estimate total procedures grew around 25% in the second quarter, compared to last year or approximately 20% when adjusted for additional selling days this year. Edwards procedures grew at about the same rates. While the PARTNER II data published in April was widely acknowledged, we do not believe it provided a significant lift in the quarter.","We saw strong procedure growth across nearly all countries and particularly strong growth in countries outside of Germany. While difficult to estimate, we believe more recent competitive entrants continue to account for about 15% of total European procedures.","As we mentioned, we are using our U.S. intermediate risk data to request an expansion of our CE Mark indication. These data were submitted to European regulators during the quarter and we continue to expect approval of an expanded label in late 2016 or early 2017. We expect gradual expansion into intermediate risk patients when the label is broadened and clinical guidelines are revised.","Our updated guidance anticipates that OUS sales may reflect a negative impact in the fourth quarter. The country of France has a policy that limits annual TAVR procedures. Strong therapy adoption there is outpacing this year's rate. We are working with the Ministry of Health in an effort to increase the procedure limit. In the absence of resolution, we expect to discontinue sales in France for the remainder of 2016 when the cap is reached, and this assumption is reflected in our guidance.","Given the strong performance of SAPIEN 3, we have decided to incorporate additional benefits into our new Ultra system before its introduction. This will move the expected European launch to the second half of 2017. This new system featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology is expected to enhance ease of use, further reduce possible complications and shorten procedure time.","Questions about transcatheter valve durability, which were first discussed during a EuroPCR presentation, were subsequently more thoroughly addressed at the TVT meeting last month. Physician presentations suggested there is a lack of evidence that TAVR valve durability differs from surgical valves. Edwards has always distinguished itself on the best-in-class performance in heart valves, and we remain confident in our SAPIEN platform and are generating long-term follow-up data in our PARTNER trials.","In summary, based on our strong first half results and anticipated third quarter approval of intermediate risk in the U.S. and momentum of global therapy adoption, we are increasing our 2016 sales guidance by $100 million to between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. We now expect our underlying sales growth to exceed 30%.","Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group, sales for the second quarter were $199 million, a decrease of 3% over last year on an underlying basis. Sales of surgical mitral valves declined, which was partially offset by solid growth in surgical aortic valves. Globally, sales of our surgical mitral valves were impacted during the quarter due to our identification of a production matter related to the holder that assists surgeons during implantation of the valve, which caused us to temporarily suspend production. We have recently resumed shipping and expect a smaller impact in the third quarter as we replenish inventories.","Worldwide surgical aortic valve units grew approximately 5% and global average selling price saw a slight decline due to regional mix. INTUITY Elite drove sales growth in Europe, and in Japan, growth was driven by aortic valves and the adoption of the recently launched tricuspid valve repair system.","During the quarter, we announced positive clinical data from our COMMENCE, TRANSFORM and FOUNDATION studies at the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons Meeting. These compelling new data on more than 2,000 patients provide important clinical evidence on the benefits of new surgical treatments, including our RESILIA tissue and INTUITY Elite valve system.","We anticipate approval in the near future of our rapid deployment INTUITY Elite valve in the U.S. This system is built upon our proven pericardial valve technology and is designed to facilitate small incision aortic valve replacement surgery and streamline combination procedures. The U.S. launch will be deliberate and focused on adoption and ensuring excellent patient outcomes. The valve system underscores our ongoing commitment to developing innovative surgical technologies to address patient needs. We continue to invest in multiple surgical platforms, as we believe that surgery will remain an important option for patients even as TAVR expands.","In summary, given our first half results, we're reducing our 2016 underlying sales growth expectation for the full year to between 0% and 2%, and we expect a meaningful contribution to growth from the INTUITY Elite launch in the U.S.","In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $142 million and grew 7% on an underlying basis. Overall growth for the quarter was strong in our core products and, once again, we recorded double-digit underlying growth in our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program. Our expansion of the U.S. sales team also stimulated stronger adoption of our market-leading products. Based upon the strong first half momentum, we are increasing our Critical Care underlying sales growth expectation to between 5% and 7% in 2016.","In structural heart initiatives, we continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and our CardiAQ-Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform.","In our early-generation CardiAQ-Edwards platform, we're in the process of implementing several enhancements, including new delivery systems and utilizing Edwards' advanced tissue. We Plan to incorporate these enhancements as part of our first CE Mark trial, and we expect to begin treating patients soon.","This trial, called the RELIEF trial, includes approximately 15 centers in Europe and Canada and will include Transapical and Transseptal delivery systems. This single arm study will include patients suffering from functional and degenerative mitral regurgitation. You will hear more specific updates about this and other programs at future clinical meetings.","In the legal matter that CardiAQ brought against Neovasc, a federal jury returned a $70 million verdict in our favor. The jury found that Neovasc, a former service provider, breached the non-disclosure agreement, misappropriated trade secrets and breached its duty of honest performance.","During the quarter, we completed two small acquisitions that add future-generation technologies to our transcatheter valve portfolio. We remain committed to developing innovative structural heart therapies and, although it's still early, we continue to believe that these therapies will ultimately benefit patients who are not well-served today.","And with that, let me turn it over to Scott.","Scott B. Ullem - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Thank you, Mike. This quarter, the number of transcatheter procedures exceeded our estimates and drove total sales of $759 million, representing 21% growth over last year, excluding the effects of foreign exchange and the prior year sales return reserve.","Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 33% versus prior year to $0.76, reflecting solid leverage. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 includes $34 million of acquired intellectual property related to early-stage transcatheter technologies, as Mike mentioned earlier. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.","For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 73.3%, compared to 74.3% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven primarily by the foreign exchange impact from inventories sold internationally and a reduced benefit from our FX hedge contracts. These were partially offset by a more profitable product mix, reflecting strong growth in THV and the impact of the THV return reserve in the prior year.","As we mentioned last quarter, to accommodate our increased sales demand going forward, we are making significant investments in manufacturing capacity inside and outside the United States, including our new facility in Costa Rica. These capacity investments moderately reduced our gross profit margin in the second quarter and are likely to continue to have a negative impact into 2017. These impacts are reflected in our full year gross profit margin guidance, which remains unchanged at 73% to 74%, excluding special items.","Sector quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7% over the prior year to $229 million or 30.1% of sales. This increase was driven primarily by sales and personnel related expenses, partially offset by the suspension of the medical device excise tax. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year.","Research and development investments in the quarter increased 16% over the prior year to $113 million or 14.9% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and aortic valve programs. We expect our R&D investments, excluding special items, to be approximately 16% of sales in the second half.","During the second quarter, we recorded $9 million in intellectual property litigation expenses, which have been excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The expenses include litigation against Neovasc in the United States and with Boston Scientific, where we now have multiple litigation matters in the United States and Europe.","Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%, up from 20.7% in the prior year period. This increase was driven largely by the impact of our early-stage intellectual property acquisitions and our increased sales in the United States, our highest tax rate region. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items such as this quarter's intellectual property acquisitions, to be between 22% and 23%.","Foreign exchange rates increased second quarter sales by $5 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our April guidance, foreign exchange rates boosted sales and favorably impacted earnings per share by $0.01 in the second quarter. At current rates, which have been volatile, we now estimate an approximate $10 million favorable impact to full year 2016 sales compared to the prior year. Brexit has obviously contributed to rate volatility, but the impact to our bottom line this year will likely be insignificant as most of the foreign exchange rate changes are expected to be offset by our hedging program. As a point of reference, UK sales represented less than 3%, of our global sales last year.","Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $153 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $190 million, less capital spending of $37 million.","Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1 billion. Total debt was approximately $600 million. Average shares outstanding during the quarter were $217 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for full year 2016 of $216 million to $220 million.","Turning to our 2016 guidance, given our strong THV momentum and expectation of continuing growth, we are raising guidance for full year 2016 THV sales to be $100 million higher than we forecasted last quarter. We now expect THV sales of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and total Edwards sales to be at the high end of our $2.7 billion to $3 billion range.","We continue to expect sales for Surgical Heart Valves within the range of $780 million to $820 million. And given the strong first half performance of Critical Care, we now expect sales within the range of $540 million to $580 million.","With today's increase in sales guidance, we now expect our adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.78 and $2.88 and we continue to expect free cash flow, excluding special items, to be between $500 million and $600 million. For the third quarter of 2016, at current foreign exchange rates, we project sales to be between $720 million and $760 million, and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.62 and $0.68.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Scott. We are very pleased with our strong performance achieved through the first half of the year. As patients and clinicians increasingly prefer TAVR and based on the substantial body of compelling evidence, we remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity represented by transcatheter therapies.","Overall, we remain committed to aggressively investing in structural heart disease and critical care technologies. We are confident that this will result in more patients being treated with our innovative therapies and continued strong organic growth.","And with that I'll turn it back over to David.","David K. Erickson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Mike. Before we open it up for questions, I would like to encourage you to mark your calendars for Thursday, December 8 when we will be hosting our 2016 Investor Conference in New York. This event will include updates on our latest technologies as well as our outlook for 2017. More information will be available in the next couple of months.","In order to allow broad participation in our Q&A, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue, and we'll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the hour. Operator, we're ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you hear me?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We can hear you fine Brooks. Can you hear us?","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Mike, actually, you were fading in and out quite a bit in the first part of your prepared remarks. I was actually going to ask if it would be possible maybe for you guys to email out your script or post it to the website, because I felt like I did miss a lot of what you said. I'm sure we'll be useful...","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","...to try to piece it together.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. If it's helpful, I suppose if it's coming in clear now, we could maybe even read it again I suppose if it's helpful to you.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","I don't know. I guess I'll defer to David Erickson on that, but I thought like I missed a lot of what was said in the first half of your remarks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, we apologize for that and we'll make sure that the transcript is available.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Perfect. I guess let me ask just two questions. First of all, congratulations on another great quarter. If in terms of raising the guidance, the Transcatheter Heart Valve guidance by $100 million, it sounds like intermediate risk may be coming a little bit earlier, U.S. is doing a little bit better, Japan doing a little bit better. Can you just kind of parse for us where you see that incremental Transcatheter Heart Valve volume coming from that constitutes that $100 million?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Brooks. Some of it already happened in Q2, right? So you've got a \u2013 chunk of it was the Q2 beat. You're right. There is an element of it that comes from what might be a little bit earlier approval that might provide a little bit of a sales boost in the third quarter. But some of it is just a reflection of the momentum that we have coming out of the second quarter. We've had two quarters of strong growth in the U.S. and Europe is growing nicely as well and Japan for that matter. So, you put those together, it's really more of a momentum issue.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. And then I guess as a follow-up to that, Mike, where do you feel like the incremental patient is coming from? And I guess, specifically, if you look at the U.S. market, do you feel like \u2013 it feels like now you're truly starting to cannibalize the surgical business, is that where the majority of patients are coming from. Do you still feel like patients are kind of coming out of the woodwork that wouldn't have been treated? Can you speak to that at all? I know it's a guesstimate, but would be helpful as well.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think as we mentioned, you may not have picked that up in our earlier remarks, but we saw growth in both large and small hospitals this quarter. So it was widespread and it was geographically dispersed across the United States. And I think the U.S. was probably the largest source of growth. We don't think there was a significant number of patients that came from surgery. We think, by far, there was more patients that just plain came into the system. We continue to believe that there is an under treatment of patients, particularly with high risk and those flow into the system.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you very much. Mike, can you hear me okay?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I hear you great, thanks.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Good. Congrats on a great quarter.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Let me follow-up on the question on the Transcatheter Valve business for a second. I'm wondering \u2013 we all have, Mike, our guesstimates with respect to how the market is bifurcated from extremely high risk, intermediate risk, down to low risk. Some of the physicians that have published on it seem to think 60% or so in the low risk, intermediate maybe a third, and high and extreme risk maybe 10%.","I'm wondering if you could maybe speak to that at this point. Given the volumes, it would imply that we are seeing some risk creep. I know you get the question a lot, but it would imply that you are. I guess the underlying question is, what sort of impact do you expect in the intermediate risk approval to actually have, whether it be in terms of patient acquisition, new center development or anything else? Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks for the question, Jason. Yeah, I realize that it must be confusing for people that are following it. And part of it is that risk ratification happened by STS score, and it's traditionally been done that way. And over time here, we've seen that risk scoring has changed, and it's changed in two ways. One, just the way that STS evaluates the patients and their scoring system themselves, and the other is that heart teams themselves are playing a significant role in that and you know that they're bringing in play factors like frailty and anatomy that aren't captured in risk score, so age certainly being a key component of that.","So, I think what you're seeing right now is just a different view of patients. They look at somebody today and say, well, I consider them high risk for surgery, knowing the kind of results that they get with transcatheter heart valves. I believe they're largely staying on indication as the NCD reinforces that, but we just have less precise estimates of what high risk, intermediate risk and low risk means compared to what we've had in the past. We continue to believe that the overall TAVR opportunity is more than $5 billion by 2021 and we're seeing that adoption.","In terms of what's going to happen when intermediate is approved, I think a couple of things. We try to remind you that we're treating patients under the CAP today, the continued access program. And so that would stop when this began. And also, we tend to think that we'll see more or a ramp, if you will, a gradual ramp, rather than a step function when that approval takes place, so that's our expectation.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","That's helpful, Mike. I appreciate that. Scott, one for you with respect to the guidance. It looks like the TAVI upside that you generated, at least relative to consensus, on the top line gave you somewhere between 40% and 50% incremental margin to the operating income line just given the beat there relative to consensus, whereas the guidance that you've given, a $100 million increase in TAVI relevant to the increase on the bottom line, would imply a much lower incremental margin for the balance of the year. Is that the spending \u2013 incremental spending \u2013 the surge in spending that you talked about last quarter and should we see a little bit better incremental margins as you roll off that surge, I guess, maybe in 2017? Thank you very much for taking the questions.","Scott B. Ullem - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","It is related to the capacity expansion activities we talked about. Just recall, for the $100 million guidance raise, part of that was already experienced in the second quarter along with the incremental profitability. So, about a third of that $100 million sales guidance increase will drop through to the operating income line across Q2, Q3 and Q4. There is less benefit to gross profit and SG&A, primarily due to these investments we're making in manufacturing and the infrastructure that we need to sustain our growth and, also, we've got some incentive performance-driven compensation running through the P&L.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. And Mike, just two cents on the quality of the opening remarks. I would just email this around to people just because you were going in and out, and I think it's probably worthwhile for people just to catch everything that you said. I did want to get your commentary on a couple of items, Mike. I heard your update on the mitral program and I was just hoping you could give us, number one, what are the gating factors, if any, at this point to starting the CE Mark trial? And then, I wanted to follow-up on the TAVR business. Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike. First, thanks for the comment on the reception. What we'll do is we'll get that script up on the website just as soon as we can, if it's not up already, so that people can view it. In terms of the question, right now, we're teed up to start the CE Mark trial. We really don't have obstacles in front of us other than just getting the sites up. So, we're ready to go to begin the trial. There are no internal hurdles or regulatory hurdles.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, Mike, you made some comments that when in and out on Ultra. I was hoping you could just explain exactly what you're doing. You said that you were incorporating some of the Ultra features into the product earlier. Can you just go through that?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, thanks. Yeah, we said, given the strong performance of SAPIEN 3, we've decided to incorporate additional benefits into our new Ultra System before its introduction. This is going to move the expected European launch into the second half of 2017. So then, remember that new system features an on-balloon delivery system and a next-generation sheath technology, and we expect it to make it easier to use, reduce possible complications and shorten procedure times.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And then, just circling back on the TAVR guidance increase, so if I look at what you reported this quarter versus the Street expectations, you exceeded the Street by about 10%, or call it like $36 million, $38 million. So versus that $36 million or $38 million, you raised your guidance by $100 million, obviously suggesting that there is a fair amount of momentum in the business.","Can you just talk about what you're seeing in the business today versus maybe what you were seeing earlier in the year? Because we all remember January and you guys commenting on how strong the market was in December into January and that continued, obviously, (31:43).","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we tried to reflect that in our remarks. Recall that we felt that the U.S. market grew more than 60% in the first quarter, and here we are even though coming off a larger base, it's growing again, in our view, more than 60%. So, this is pretty terrific market growth, and we would've expected it to begin to slow. So that's one element that's stronger; and just the strength of the SAPIEN 3 data is putting us in a very favorable position as well and giving clinicians a lot of confidence.","We were pleased with what's going on in Europe. We were glad to see the growth rate of Europe be 20%, and our growth tracked that. And we have had continued discussions with FDA that cause us to believe that we'll get the intermediate risk indication in the third quarter. So just a strong momentum; looking at what's ahead, we feel pretty confident about our guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a great quarter. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. Mike, you can hear me okay?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Larry, we hear you great. Thank you.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good. All right. So, just one on international TAVR business, and then one on the \u2013 I'll be the bad guy \u2013 on the durability question. So, in Europe, Mike, what drove the improvement in Europe from Q1 to Q2? And second, on Japan, it looks likes sales in the first quarter were about $15 million, increased to about $20 million, $25 million in the second quarter. I assume SAPIEN 3 drove that. Can you just provide a little bit more color on what's going on in both of those markets? Thanks. And then, I have my follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Primarily in Europe, we're seeing market growth. We saw it, really, in all countries. We saw it step up in Germany, but we saw it step up even more in the countries that are less penetrated than Germany; and those had some pretty terrific growth rates during the quarter. And then, the other thing that happened is we probably saw the share position stabilize in Europe in this last quarter, so that all contributed to that. Did that get at your question?","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. And Japan, Mike, it seems like a pretty nice acceleration there. It's $20 million, $23 million, $25 million in the quarter; closed at about $15 million in the first quarter, which is obviously a pretty nice pick up?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'm not sure we broke out Japan. Japan is growing at a very high rate, but remember that's a small base and still a small contributor to OUS. And we have the launch of SAPIEN 3 that's going on right now in Japan, so that's helping drive growth.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Fair enough. Then, Mike, on the durability question, obviously, there was some pretty un-rigorous data at PCR and some better data at TVT last month, I think you alluded to earlier. I guess, what do you think is needed to kind of address the durability question? Are you seeing any impact in the market? Obviously, the results were stellar, so the answer is probably no, but what \u2013 and lastly, are there any long-term datasets from European registries like SOURCE that you think can help address this and when could we see more data? So, thanks for taking the questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Larry. Yeah, absolutely, there were some pretty sensational headlines and, certainly, those prompted questions. But to us, it really hasn't appeared that it's been a significant issue with clinicians. They remain enthusiastic about the impact that TAVR can have on their patients.","I'll remind you that EuroPCR that original \u2013 those headlines hit around mid-Q2 and they didn't appear to have near-term impact on overall therapy adoption in the quarter. We are committed to studying this. So when you talk about long-term data, we can't imagine there being better long-term data than what we can generate out of our PARTNER trials. We have great datasets there, they're well controlled, and so we plan to pursue those patients on a long-term basis and follow those. And we think that will be the best way to really shine a light on the issue.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Mike, just a quick review and then maybe couple of follow-ups for Scott, quick ones. So, Mike, we're sort of in this weird position, right, where we have very good data from intermediate risks, we don't yet have the approval I guess, and talking to your large centers sort of intra quarter, they see a lot of demand coming. They're actually, if anything, worried about infrastructure at their center.","So, it feels like they're hiring, they're training, they're making budget request for traditional infrastructure. Can you comment on what behavior you've seen out of your largest centers or, frankly, large and small centers, given the impact of this quarter kind of prior to the approval? Have you seen a change in relative activity?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it really felt like more of a continuation of their efforts. They're enthusiastic and they continue to optimize their own programs, continue to find ways to add capacity, so this is an ongoing dialog that's going on with all the centers, large and small, and we thought one of the things that was noteworthy this quarter is the growth that we've seen out of the medium-size and small-size centers. In the past, it felt like there was an awful lot that came out of the largest centers, and it feels broader based at this point.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, very helpful. And then, Scott, just a couple of quick financial questions. The first is just my favorite question on margins. Your back half guidance basically implies that margins head higher as a percent of sales than sort of the first half of the year, but I think we're all expecting a sales inflection in the back of the year, so it seems hard for sales to inflect and margins to get incrementally worse. So maybe you can give us some more specifics besides compensation or specific performance awards? And the second question is, and kind of related, on the new FASB stock-based comp guidelines, you're one of the companies that sees potentially a material benefit this year heading into next year, maybe your thoughts around that would be helpful? Thanks so much.","Scott B. Ullem - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Sure, David. In terms of profitability, we are seeing pressure on just in terms of capacity expansion and we felt that a little bit, it's probably less than 0.5 points of gross margin in the second quarter, but we believe it would be higher than that as we look out to the second half of the year. So, yes, we got incentive compensation, but what's really unusual in terms of this gearing from sales down to the bottom line is the investments that we're continuing to make to grow our capacity. In terms of the accounting change, we do plan to implement it in January 2017 as required by the accounting pronouncement.","If we would've done it last year, our earnings per share would've been something like $0.17 higher than they were, but given the potential for all the variability and how this is calculated, because it's based on our stock price and the option values that employee awards come with and how many of those options are exercised, it's risky to start making assumptions about what that's going to look like.","We're also thinking through how we're going to present this in terms of presenting our adjusted EPS and we'll get back to you on that as we look towards providing 2017 guidance at our investor meeting in December.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Matt, your line is open, so if you would like to ask a question.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Can you \u2013 sorry about that, can you hear me okay?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We can hear you now, Matt.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. So, just a follow-up on capacity and how the U.S. centers are adjusting to volumes. Can you talk at all about some of the procedure optimization best practices in some of these larger centers that and how, as we think about how you're positioned to sort of address those and optimize procedure times, hospital stays and that sort of thing as these folks look to get more efficient today and going forward? And I have one follow up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's a mix of things. Probably the single biggest one is that they're able to do more cases per day with SAPIEN 3 than they have in the past. And so that's adding capacity, and just adding a little bit of case per day adds an awful lot of capacity when you aggregate that.","That's also integrated with what's going on today with the minimalist approach, which includes conscious sedation, shorter ICU stays, you don't have to coordinate with an anesthesiologist the way you used to and so forth. And those are truly adding capacity to the system. I think you broadly are watching people share best practices and improve their efforts across the board.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And just in terms of the speed of getting a procedure done. If we think about the kinds of patients that (41:25) intermediate risk, you talked a lot about over the past year or so as difference between what's a low risk, what's an intermediate risk, what's a high risk patient look like, obviously, not just an STS score, but can you frame for us anything about how far we're tipping into sort of intermediate risk today on an STS basis and understanding there's co-morbidities and other elements that make a patient high risk and then how that might change as we get post approval just to give it sense of how these assessments may change in the back half of the year into next year?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I guess I know we try and talk about it a lot and this must be difficult if you're a couple of steps away from this. But the STS score is not becoming as relevant as it was in the past. The heart teams have really taken ownership of these issues of which patients and they're utilizing their judgment. We think that broadly hospitals are saying on indication and that's been very clear, because remember you have an NCD in place that drives discipline in that regard. Having said that, if you are on the borderline of high risk and intermediate risk, might those patients be judged as somebody that should be treated today, yes, that's very possible.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good afternoon. Wonderful quarter, of course. Mike, could you just \u2013 I have two questions. Mike, could you just repeat what you said about France? And if things do go well and you get relief, what would that do to the $100 million raise in TAVR guidance?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So, what we've said is that our updated guidance anticipates that OUS sales may reflect a negative impact in the fourth quarter, that the country of France has a policy that limits annual TAVR procedures and a strong therapy adoption is outpacing this year's rate. We're working with the Ministry of Health in an effort to increase the procedure limit, but in the absence of a resolution, we expect to discontinue sales in France for the remainder of 2016 when the cap is reached, and that assumption is indeed in our guidance. So, we're not reflecting exactly how much, but that is a factor that's in there.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, terrific. And then, on a day like today, you obviously don't need it. But I was wondering, could you just speak generally about the indication expansion trials beyond PARTNER III? UNLOAD was one of them. I know you're probably going to tackle some of the asymptomatic patients as well as bicuspid patients who tend to be younger; like, when might we start to see results from that and how important is that \u2013 those trials and indication expansions to the ultimate size of the market, assuming you get to $5 billion, pretty easily with what you've got indicated now and including PARTNER III?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, yeah, on UNLOAD, I don't know precise timing, and although that's going to be a contributor, it's relatively small. Probably the biggest one that's not in our estimates, that when we say it's going to be larger than $5 billion in 2021 is asymptomatic patients. And although that's not supported by current guidelines, we believe that patients with severe AF that have not yet presented with symptoms could benefit from earlier therapy. And it's an area that we have high interest. We've not yet established a timetable to begin studying the effect. It would be a groundbreaking trial. And we'd expect that there would be significant debate among the clinical community and regulators on the trial's specifics and merits. So, that's one that we'll have to stay tuned on.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good afternoon. I wonder if I could ask, after a quarter like you just posted in terms of the capacity in the United States, in terms of the number of centers, do you start rethinking the numbers of centers that could do that when you post a quarter like you just did?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're estimating that the number of centers that we're serving in the U.S. now is around 450. And there are centers that are finding ways to add the capability to be able to get within the NCD; generally, that's happening slowly, but it's happening steadily and it is a contributor to growth.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","So do you \u2013 I think at one point you talked about maybe 400 or plus or minus kind of centers being your view on how many there should be. Can you give an updated thought on how many centers you think we could ultimately get to in the United States?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a tough one. I mean the fact that we're 450 now and probably approaching 500 is probably a newer estimate based on what we've actually experienced. It is difficult for us to project in the future and it gets affected by the level of consolidation that's going on in the U.S. hospital industry. So, difficult for us to decide exactly where that comes out at this point, Raj.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just one quick on mitral. I appreciate your moving forward with CardiAQ valve. What are your current thoughts on repair products for functional disease? Do you feel the necessity to have sort of a complete portfolio and to move forward with those types of products as well?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's a great question, Raj. We think about it a lot at Edwards. We have been believers for some time that it will take a tool kit to address mitral regurgitation and heart failure, and that its unlikely that any single product is going to be a silver bullet that's going to take care of all patients. So, we continue to have a high level of interest in repair as well as replacements and it's one that we pay a lot of attention to.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","So, will we hear more soon I guess or?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If we have something to share, we'll of course do that, Raj.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Fair enough. Nice quarter. Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on an excellent quarter. Mike, I'm just going to ask the intermediate risk question maybe another way, any updated thoughts on potential ultimate penetration of that market, and how quickly you can get there? Number one. And number two, what that does to the outlook for the surgical valve business and how we should be thinking about that business growing over the medium- to long-term?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks. We feel really good about intermediate risk, and we felt like we had some pretty spectacular results, obviously, that suggests that the treatment with SAPIEN 3 is even better than surgery. And so, that part is very encouraging for us. But we know the practice of medicine has traditionally been slow to change and that that's going to take some time. So, we more think in our mind that it's going to be a gradual, but steady, increase. We're yet to see if that really changes the total addressable market. We've always believed that we would have intermediate risk approval and that was in our more than $5 billion estimate that we put out there when we did our Investor Conference last time.","When it comes to the impact on surgical valve, you recall that we continue to have growth in aortic valves. They grew about 5% just this last quarter. So, we have not changed our view that surgical valve business is going to grow in the face of TAVR expansion. And there are several factors there. You've got the ageing global demographics working in your favor; generally, under-treatment of patients; there's more innovations of high value, like INTUITY; you got tissue to mechanical conversion; and, the emerging markets are getting wealthier and able to treat their patients. So, all those factors, we think, are going to be ones that drive growth in surgery for a while.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","And if I could follow up on intermediate risk, if you use the high-risk indication as a proxy, it looks like market growth has exceeded expectations on two fronts. Number one, it sounds like the aortic stenosis market, patients getting diagnosed and referred, is much larger, and then, of course, just the penetration of TAVR into the high-risk market. And I guess I'm wondering if the intermediate risk patient population is different in a way that we would not see \u2013 we could not use high risk as a proxy for intermediate risk. Does that make sense?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think I understand. We've struggled with this, Danielle. I think we've mentioned this in the past. We probably have a greater sense of vision for the long-term than we do in the short-term. It's very difficult for us to estimate what's going to happen quarter-by-quarter or even year-by-year. We believe that this is very successful therapy and that the data has demonstrated that it's excellent for these patients and they should get treated; in the absence, a patient \u2013 they've got a pretty poor prognosis. So we think that, ultimately, they're going to be treated, and much of this is going to depend on basically the message being out there and the referral system working. So, it's a judgment call, but we believe that this technology will continue to improve; and as it improves, more and more patients will be treated.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","All right. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Gillings with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.","John T. Gillings - JMP Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's a little bit weak, John, but we hear you.","John T. Gillings - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll try to talk a little louder. So, just quickly on the mitral side, you mentioned the positive jury verdict in the trade secret case against Neovasc, but there are still a number of issues that are being resolved in the post-trial motions, including whether or not there will be an injunction. And given that there are a limited number of KOLs and centers with the qualifications to run these kind of trials and that a lot of them don't want to do \u2013 trial two devices at the same time, if an injunction comes through, could we potentially see faster enrollment rates for the CardiAQ-Edwards valve and potentially shorter time lines to commercialization?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question. As you know, we are waiting for the judge to render a decision on several outstanding matters, and that includes an injunction and patent ownership. So, there is the potential for multiple trials to be ongoing. We don't think that Neovasc is so advanced that they have the whole mitral clinical community tied up. So, I'm not sure that that's going to be a major factor. We think we do have access to some of the best centers in the world and we look forward to being able to get that without limitation.","John T. Gillings - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, maybe just quickly to follow-up on Raj's question earlier on the repair side in mitral, any color you'd be willing to offer on your investment and option on Harpoon?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, we continue to like that investment. I think we talked about it a few quarters ago when we put it in place. And it's indicative of that feeling that we have that mitral repair might actually have an important place in the future. We like that particular investment because it allowed us to make a reasonable and nominal one on what we think is very promising therapy, but wait to see how the data turns out; and if it looks good, we have an option to actually acquire the company. So, we're pleased with that as a strategy and would do more like that.","John T. Gillings - JMP Securities LLC","All right. Thanks a lot guys and congrats on the quarter.","Michael A.

Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Just one \u2013 first, a clarification, I think the color around Europe and the accelerating TAVI growth, did you say the impact of selling days added 5% to the quarter? Did I hear that correctly?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, essentially we think about 5% \u2013 isn't it, Scott, 63 days versus 60 days a year ago?","Scott B. Ullem - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Yeah, which translated into about 5% benefit to underlying growth. And on a consolidated basis, it contributed to about 1.5% additional growth in the quarter for all of Edwards.","Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, so no benefit in the U.S.?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, you know, just broadly in Europe, our team feels that that patient population keeps percolating into TAVI and that there is an increase, but without a surge.","Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. And then, just on gross margin, you mentioned added expenses that will continue into 2017, and I would think that some of that, including hiring, training, overtime, would be more frontloaded or temporary. So, is that a reasonable way to think about it? And do you think that some of the spend will come off as we get into next year?","Scott B. Ullem - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Yeah, I'd group it into a couple of different categories. One is, just near-term, as you can see just through our gross margin line, we're pursuing multiple avenues to increasing capacity, and those costs are coming through in the form of overtime and hiring and training at our existing facilities. We're expediting logistics to move product around the world. We're adding production equipment. We're rebalancing capacity between our facilities. So, as you look out to 2017 and beyond, we're expanding our existing facilities and we're going to open new facilities, including our new plant in Costa Rica. We will get leverage as we increase that capacity, but for the short-term, for those two reasons I just mentioned, we're going to have some continued pressure on the gross margin line.","Matt J.

Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks for the question, Glenn. No, we didn't lay that out. And some of that is somewhat variable still. So, it's not clear, it's going to depend much on how we do.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. When you put out the press release announcing the first implant, will we get that level of detail?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know that we'd put a press release out on the first implant. Well, I would say that would be unlikely. You are more likely to see updates at the clinical meetings. Our clinicians, they love to talk about their clinical results. So, that's where I'd expect an update. If we have something meaningful, we will certainly talk about it on our quarterly calls.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then one last question, did I hear you correctly that you've started litigation against Boston Scientific and their Lotus valve? And if so, are you enforcing \u2013 are those the Anderson patents that you're enforcing? Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks. A matter of fact, there are cases. The litigation actually was initiated by Boston Scientific, which disappointed us. But in response, we have also filed litigation against them. So, there are going to be some European cases there that come to trial early next year.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, Mike and thanks for taking the questions. Is there an opportunity, kind of as revenues have grown so quickly, to see sort of more leverage on SG&A? And what I'm getting at it is, as the centers improve their productivity, you're not adding as many centers, is it kind of more efficient case coverage and therefore more leverage as you go over the next several quarters on the operating side?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks for that, Ben. Yeah, I think your assumption overall is a good one; if all of the growth were to come in transcatheter aortic valves, that certainly should be a source of leverage, because as you correctly note, there is a limited number of centers engaged. But remember, we're also pursuing a number of other growth opportunities that might require investments in SG&A. So, we hesitate to make long-term projections about the SG&A rate, because we don't have clarity on those other investments.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Mike, you've mentioned a couple of small acquisitions in the quarter, maybe talk a little bit about what those are related to? And is there a particular area of technology innovation that's you're interested in for transcatheter specifically.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, these are transcatheter technologies that probably provide opportunities for us that are more long-term in nature. They include intellectual property and some know-how that we're very happy to get, and it's too early for us to share the particulars that are associated with that, but I think it's indicative of what you should expect from Edwards, which is we're going to continue to invest in next-generation systems, and even though we're enjoying a lot of success with SAPIEN 3 right now, we think we have the opportunity to make the next-generation technologies much better.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, one last quick one. Bruce tried to get you to give us a number for France if they raise the quota. Is there any kind of an estimate there? Is that a $5 million, $10 million, $20 million opportunity? Thank you","Scott B. Ullem - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","It's Scott. We haven't given the number. It's mixed into the overall guidance range they we're talking about. So, bringing up guidance to $100 million including the second quarter results and we're just not going to get into how the model works, but it is in our guidance for the second half.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And the other thing I will add is, we're still hopeful it doesn't come to that, our primary goal is to get the cap increase so that we can address patients that need the therapy.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Of course. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good evening, gentlemen. Thanks a lot. I just wanted to ask about, I believe that MedStar is enrolling a low risk trial, single arm. Do you guys \u2013 I hate to ask you about it, a trial that you're not sponsoring, but do we know anything about enrollment and whether or not we'll see any data out of that trial in 2017 prior to entering enrollment of PARTNER III.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks for the question. But no, we're not a sponsor of that trial, so we really don't have insight much as to what they're doing. We're obviously focused on our PARTNER III Trial, that's what we think of greatest importance and has the opportunity to change the indication in the future.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. And just a follow-up question. I just wanted to ask about European guidelines. And my understanding is the timing for guideline update is next year for an intermediate risk. Is there any path for accelerated guideline update? And then just to follow-up on some of the questions about pre-intermediate risk approval utilization in those borderline cases in the U.S., any color on what's going on and what you expected to happen prior to the guideline update would be helpful? Thanks a lot.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Josh. In Europe, it's our expectation that that's going to be a pretty deliberate process. As we indicated, we submitted our data that came from PARTNER II and that we would expect a CE Mark to occur somewhere around the first of the year. But we think guidelines probably don't get changed till possibly the third quarter of next year. They have a pretty standard process they go through.","Having said that, guideline changes are helpful in Europe, but they're also \u2013 it's going to be somewhat dependent on what their decisions are on a country-by-country base related to their reimbursement. In the U.S., probably the best guidance we have right now is what we just did for the quarter. As we try and project ahead and know exactly what clinicians would do, it's difficult for us to say. We hear a lot of positive messages, but we also believe that people are going to stay disciplined on indication and that our teams are the ones that are really driving the therapy adoption at this point. So, it's probably all the help that I can provide at this point.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well.","Operator","There are no questions at this time...","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you very much for your continued interest in Edwards.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Erickson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Erickson. You may begin.","David K. Erickson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Welcome and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our first quarter 2015 financial results. During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A.

Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release and on our website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, David.","We're pleased to report a robust start to 2015 with first quarter results of $590 million in total sales, representing an underlying growth rate of 21%. This reflects strong performance across all product lines and regions. Significant Transcatheter Heart Valve sales once again drove the majority of this quarter's growth with notable contributions from our minimally invasive INTUITY valve and enhanced surgical recovery platforms. And most importantly, even more patients are benefiting from our lifesaving technologies than ever before.","In THV, we continue to see strong therapy adoption. Underlying global sales grew 51%. This was driven by continuing strong procedural growth in all major geographies and sales of our innovative new products. Globally, average selling prices remained stable. Outside the U.S., THV sales grew 38% on an underlying basis during the quarter, once again driven by strong procedure growth in Europe and the ongoing launch in Japan.","I want to take you through the growth drivers by region. Starting with Europe, we estimate overall therapy adoption grew approximately 30%. Although transcatheter valves have been commercial for eight years, we believe demand remains strong for several reasons. First, general practitioners and general cardiologists are referring more patients to TAVR. We believe this is being driven by growing awareness, favorable clinical outcomes, and stable reimbursement. Second, advanced technologies like SAPIEN 3 are improving outcomes and stimulating procedural growth. And finally, high risk patients in Europe are being treated based on their EuroSCORE as well as physician judgment, which takes into account a combination of age, frailty and comorbidities that support the use of TAVR.","With this as a backdrop, our competitive position in Europe strengthened during the first quarter, driven by the introduction of SAPIEN 3 last year. Clinician feedback on this platform has been very positive and sales of this product in the quarter represented more than 90% of our THV sales in Europe. In total, we estimate newer competitors' products were used in approximately 10% of procedures this last quarter. We anticipate growing competition during the remainder of the year from large competitors with newer product offerings.","In Japan, our sales grew sequentially. We recently received regulatory approval for our 20-millimeter and 29-millimeter valve sizes, and reimbursement is expected to take effect in the near future. This will help broaden the population of patients who could benefit from this technology. We continue to believe that Japan represents an attractive opportunity for TAVR and will contribute to our growth even as competition increases.","Turning to the U.S., reported THV sales for the quarter were $131 million. Although sequential growth was modest, underlying growth, including $10 million of royalties, was 67% versus the prior year. We believe U.S. TAVR overall therapy adoption grew even faster, driven by several factors. First, awareness and adoption are still growing rapidly since the introduction of this therapy in late 2011. This confirms the large previously untreated patient population with severe aortic stenosis.","Second, newer technologies, like SAPIEN XT and clinical experience are driving improved outcomes. And finally, hospital economics are improving, in part because of shorter length of stay and improved reimbursement. Providing more clarification on the U.S. THV results, clinical sales from our SAPIEN 3 continued access program were a modest contributor in the quarter, as required documentation took longer than expected. Stocking and consignment had a minimal impact this quarter.","Late in the quarter, at the ACC conference, 30-day SAPIEN 3 data for high and intermediate risk patients were presented, which included almost 1,600 patients from 51 U.S. centers. These data demonstrated the lowest all-cause mortality and stroke rates of any of our PARTNER studies as well as excellent results on other key metrics. And while this was only 30-day data, the outcomes are encouraging for the future of the therapy and eventual expansion of the approved indication.","Also presented were the five-year PARTNER data for high-risk patients treated with the first-generation SAPIEN valve, which demonstrated equivalent outcomes to traditional open heart surgery and durable valve performance. These results continue to validate the benefits of our SAPIEN technology and should help support the long-term growth of TAVR.","Based on the strength of the SAPIEN 3 data presented at ACC, the very positive clinician feedback about the valve's performance and the encouraging discussions with the FDA, we believe it's becoming more likely that we will obtain U.S. approval of our latest-generation valve this year. For modeling purposes, our updated guidance assumes sales beginning in the fourth quarter.","Turning to our product pipeline, as we look ahead to the Euro PCR meeting next month, clinicians will present data on their experience with SAPIEN 3 in the commercial setting. And our self-expanding CENTERA valve platform featuring an enhanced motorized delivery system continues to make progress. We began enrollment in our pivotal trial in Europe and continue to expect commercial launch of this new platform in 2016.","In summary, we're pleased with the strength of our global THV sales performance. We believe overall TAVR therapy adoption growth rates will moderate due to the strong uptick in the second half of 2014. Additionally, we expect competitive activity will continue to increase. However, in light of the strong start to 2015, we now expect our underlying sales growth in 2015 to be at the high end of our previous 15% to 25% range.","Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy group, total sales this quarter were $197 million, up 5% on an underlying basis. Unit gains across most geographies drove the majority of this growth, while a favorable product mix also contributed to a slightly higher overall ASP. The growth rate of this product group was impacted by the previously discussed exit of certain non-strategic products and this impact will continue throughout the year.","Globally, underlying surgical valve unit growth was led by sales of our premium valves across all major regions. Strong sales of INTUITY Elite helped drive growth in Europe, and continued adoption of our PERIMOUNT valves lifted sales in China. In the U.S., we experienced solid growth in both aortic and mitral units, driven by our premium Magna family. Our activities in support of the Edwards INTUITY Elite U.S. approval remain on track and we continue to expect to file the PMA in 2015 and launch in 2016.","In summary, we're pleased with the continued strength of our premium products in our surgical valve product line, we're continuing to exit non-strategic products as planned, and we are reiterating our underlying sales growth guidance of 1% to 3% for 2015.","Turning to the Critical Care product group, total sales for the quarter grew 3% on an underlying basis, as expected, to $125 million. Usage of Enhanced Surgical Recovery products, or ESR, including FloTrac and ClearSight, grew approximately 20%. Critical Care sales outside the U.S. were lifted by continued adoption in China. Our ESR program, which is focused on reducing patient complications and hospital lengths of stay, plays to our strength as the leader in hemodynamic monitoring.","As clinical support for ESR continues to gain momentum, it should enable us to capitalize on the global under-penetrated opportunity. We remain on track with our plan to expand the reach of our non-invasive ClearSight system with our upcoming launch in Japan. So to summarize our Critical Care product line, we're pleased with the continuing adoption of our ESR products and we are reiterating our underlying sales growth guidance of 2% to 4%.","Before I turn it over to Scott, I'll close with a brief statement about our transcatheter mitral valve replacement program, where we're pleased with the continuing progress. To-date, we've treated more than 20 patients globally with the FORTIS valve, all of whom had symptomatic mitral regurgitation and who were either compassionate cases or in one of our high-risk surgical registries. And while it's still very early in the program and the road to commercialization is challenging, we are encouraged by what we are learning. As we have said previously, our clinical partners will provide outcomes information at major medical meetings.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Scott.","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Mike. This quarter our sales were $590 million, including $10 million of royalties, representing an increase of 13% over 2014. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to have a significant impact. Excluding last year's sales return reserve and the impact of foreign currency, growth in the first quarter was 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 47% to $1.12, primarily driven by our THV sales performance. This earnings per share was higher than our expected range, primarily because of strong sales and some anticipated selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development spending that was delayed until the second quarter.","The stronger U.S. dollar will have an even more significant impact to sales results during 2015 than we forecasted in our last earnings call. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect 2015 sales to be reduced by $190 million compared to prior-year rates. Like many other global companies, Edwards' earnings are subject to significant impact as a result of the large movements in currencies. However, unlike some other companies in our sector, our 2015 earnings will be largely insulated as a result of our foreign currency hedging strategy.","Recall that we enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts that generate income at the gross profit line when the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies. This quarter, our gross profit margin was significantly boosted by these contracts. Additionally, our reported expenses from outside the United States were reduced by these exchange rates. Therefore, our operating margin benefited from the influence of FX rates. If rates remain at current levels, it is important to understand that our company will ultimately realize a significant negative FX impact on earnings in 2016.","I'll now cover the details behind our Q1 results, including guidance for the remainder of the year. For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 77%, compared to 72% in the same period last year. This increase was driven by a nearly 250-basis point positive impact from FX, an approximate 200-basis point impact from last year's THV product exchange and a 100-basis point improvement from a more profitable product mix. These increases were partially offset by higher spending in our operations.","If foreign exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect our full-year gross profit rate to be approximately 77%, driven by the same factors that impacted this quarter. For 2016, at current rates, as favorable hedge positions roll off, we expect the foreign exchange impact to gross profits to reverse next year.","First quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% to $202 million or 34.3% of sales over the prior year. This increase was driven primarily by personnel-related expenses, largely offset by the favorable FX impact on our expenses outside the U.S. We expect a step-up in SG&A expenses next quarter as we incur expenses originally anticipated in the first quarter. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 35% and 36% of sales for the full year.","Research and development investments in the quarter were $86 million or 14.6% of sales. Although we continued to invest heavily in transcatheter valve programs, expenses were lower than anticipated as certain THV clinical expenses expected in the first quarter are now expected to occur in the second. We continue to expect our R&D investments to be between 15% and 16% of sales for the full year.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $2 million, down from $4 million in the prior year. This reduction was driven by lower debt levels and increased interest income from higher investment balances. For the full year, we continue to expect net interest expense to be approximately $10 million.","Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 24%. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 21% and 23%. The tax rate for the first three quarters should be higher than the fourth quarter based on our assumption of a fourth quarter renewal of the federal research and development tax credit.","Foreign exchange rates decreased first quarter sales by $41 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our February guidance, FX rates had less than a $0.01 impact on earnings per share. As I mentioned earlier, at current rates, we now estimate a $190 million negative impact to full year 2015 sales, which is $30 million more than the impact we estimated last quarter. The resulting impact to 2015 earnings should be mitigated by our foreign exchange hedges.","Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $52 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $73 million, less capital spending of $21 million. At the end of the quarter we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion, approximately 55% of which is outside of the U.S. Total debt was approximately $600 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares for $100 million. We now estimate diluted shares outstanding for the full year to be at the high end of our previous range of 109 million to 111 million shares.","Now turning to our 2015 guidance. I'll start by commenting on the potential impact of a 2015 approval for SAPIEN 3, which assumes sales beginning in the fourth quarter. We expect the SAPIEN 3 launch in the U.S. to contribute approximately $10 million in incremental sales in the first couple of months. However, due to the required accounting and one-time expenses associated with this product introduction, like our new product introductions in 2014, we are unlikely to record significant incremental net sales or earnings per share in the first quarter of launch. In other words, if we receive approval in the fourth quarter, we would not expect to see any upward lift from SAPIEN 3 until 2016.","Due to the strong first quarter performance in transcatheter valves and despite additional negative impact expected from foreign exchange, we expect full year total sales to be within our original guidance of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. For Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, we expect sales to be within our original guidance of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. Given the foreign exchange currency drag, we continue to expect sales for Surgical Heart Valves at the lower end of $780 million to $820 million range, and in Critical Care, at the lower end of our $520 million to $570 million range.","For full year 2015, we continue to expect free cash flow, excluding special items, to be between $375 million and $425 million. Given the momentum of transcatheter heart valve sales coming out of the first quarter and the mitigating effect of our FX hedging program, we are narrowing our diluted earnings per share guidance to $4.10 to $4.30, excluding special items. For the second quarter 2015, at current foreign exchange rates we project total sales to be between $580 million and $620 million and diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be between $1 and $1.10.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Scott.","We're very pleased with the strong start to the year and we \u2013 as we continue to focus on driving growth with our leading innovative technologies. Our foundation of leadership coupled with our robust product pipeline positions us well for continued long-term success and greater shareholder value. We are confident in our outlook for continued strong sales growth and we remain passionate about helping more patients around the world.","And with that, I'll turn it over to David.","David K. Erickson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Mike. In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue, and we'll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the hour.","Operator, we're ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, Mike. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I hear you great, Jason.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And I apologize if you went over some of this. I hopped on the call late; several calls this afternoon. But starting with the TAVI business, I heard Scott say obviously perhaps some impact from SAPIEN 3 in the fourth quarter. Could you give us a sense for the first 12 months after SAPIEN 3 launch and sort of what \u2013 obviously given that the competitor is still ramping, what sort of share thoughts you have with respect to your U.S. TAVI business sort of in the first 12 months after the SAPIEN 3 finds its way to the U.S. market?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're \u2013 thanks for that, Jason. We're pleased with our position today. We already have a very strong competitive position, and we're looking forward to actually have SAPIEN 3 add to that strength. Having said that, the only guidance that we're providing at this point is that we think that it's more likely that we get approval this year, and if it were to come in the fourth quarter, we were just explaining that they probably not going to have much financial impact on 2015; it'll occur in 2016. We'd be getting ahead of ourselves to lay out guidance for 2016 at this point, Jason. So, we're going to let that go. I mean, our experience in Europe has been a good one, though.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Right. And the experience in Europe, how informative is it for you and for us as we look at SAPIEN 3's competitiveness there over the last 15 months? And then secondly, in Europe, I apologize again if you went over this in prepared remarks and I missed it, but our due diligence would suggest you've been getting a nice price premium with SAPIEN 3. I'm wondering if that's held in Europe and what your thoughts are with respect to pricing SAPIEN 3 in the U.S. And I'll get back in queue. Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jason. Yeah, we have to be careful of not too many questions. But let me go after these. In terms of SAPIEN 3 in Europe, again we're pleased with the way that's doing. You know, it's tough to call out a perfect predictor of what's going to happen in the U.S. A lot depends on whether our competitor gets their new product launched and where their timing is versus ours. So that may be a little different than what we've seen. We've been launching SAPIEN 3 in Europe against an older generation valve of our competition for the most part. In terms of pricing, your point is a good one. We feel like we have commanded a premium price in Europe, and as we commented, our global ASPs are very stable. That's been stable by region, and I wouldn't expect that trend to change with the introduction of SAPIEN 3.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, and good evening, everybody. I wanted just to start with a comment, Mike, that was in the press release this time, you brought it up on the call about in anticipation that procedure volumes are likely going to slow and competitive activity pick up. I think you made the same comment in the third quarter 2014 earnings call and press release as well. Could you maybe just talk about what timeline you're thinking of when you make that comment? And has anything changed about either the market or your competitive position since you initially made those comments back in October?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, David. Yeah, it's a good comment. I mean, for a while last year I think we were surprised at the rate that the market growth increased, and we particularly saw that uptick come, I would say, starting in about Q3, because Q3 of last year we had SAPIEN XT really kicking in in the U.S. and there seemed to be a real jump in the procedure growth. And at the same time, it seemed as though there was a similar phenomena going on in Europe. So our feeling is that the comparisons get significantly different when you get into the second half of 2015, and we're just calling that to your attention. And also just the fact that competition is intensifying, both from larger competitors as well as more small ones.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Understood. And then, Scott, I just want to be very clear on FX, so hopefully just bear with me for a second. So as I think about 2016 and the P&L conceptually, you're going to have, it sounds like, about a 250-basis point benefit this year from currency hedges, so essentially the underlying gross margin is 74.5%. So as we think about 2016 we can make some assumption about what we think is going to happen from a mix standpoint, but the building point is kind of 74.5% on the gross margin because the hedges are one-time, but then as you go down the P&L, things like SG&A, if you're paying someone \u20ac100,000, for example, that \u2013 assuming rates stay where they are, that's permanently a lower number in U.S. dollars, so the SG&A numbers wouldn't see a reversal like we see in gross profit?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I can make a comment, and Scott could clarify. Yeah, I think generally, your math is correct. I think, when we estimated back at the investor conference time that we would have around a 75% gross margin, we already anticipated some FX drag, probably of 50 basis points, so some of that may have already been in our projections when we projected this year. So that's one piece. And your comments about the SG&A being lower is correct. Those natural hedges will continue.","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","David, what I would just add is I think directionally, your math is right, just taking 250 basis points off of our expected 77% this year. We do expect some mix improvement, but we also expect some ongoing operating expenses to continue onto 2016, and those may grow.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start with Mitral. Mike, over 20 patients, that's a lot. So I guess my question is, are you willing to kind of talk about the timeline at least for CE Mark approval and the design freeze? Thanks. And then I have a follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks. No, we're very pleased to be gathering this level of experience at this point. And as I said, generally, we're encouraged by this. I think, the way you might think about it is we'd like to make the decision before year-end whether we move forward with the FORTIS design to a CE Mark or whether we decide to wait for a next generation that incorporates a number of enhancements to move to a CE Mark. And we haven't made that determination yet. We'd like to get some more clinical experience. But I do think that we'll make that decision yet this year.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And then maybe you can talk about what impact you've seen so far from the data presented at ACC in both the U.S. and Europe? And how does the data at ACC affect your long-term market projection of over $3 billion in sales in 2019? Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks for that, Larry. Yeah, you know, the ACC meeting actually occurred late in Q1, so it's unlikely that it had any impact really on the first quarter. And it's kind of soon even now, Larry, to estimate the immediate impact on sales. The outcomes are encouraging for the future of the therapy and the eventual expansion and the eventual approval of the indication. So that's favorable, but I don't know that we're ready to offer a formal assessment on what the overall market size will be. That'll be coming in the future.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I wonder if I could ask about the sequential U.S. growth. I think last quarter was relatively flat and this quarter you saw a modest uptick but still relatively flat. Perhaps you could offer a little bit as to what you see happening and is it a question of needing to train more centers? Or anything would be helpful.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think, your observation is a good one, Raj. We didn't grow sequentially very much from the last quarter, but we think the market remains very favorable. Historically, it's kind of tough to know a lot quarter-to-quarter. Things tend to move around, but the overall trend has been \u2013 just been for increased market adoption. And remember, the ACC came late enough in the quarter; probably didn't have much impact. We were I'm sure impacted by the launch of our competitor, who gained some share in the U.S., probably since the end of last year.","Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then just a question around centers, what's been the pace there? And in terms of new centers wanting to get trained, have you seen any change in that dynamic?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. New centers continue to want to be trained, Raj. I think there's probably something in the neighborhood of around 10 centers that were added since the beginning of the year. But remember, they have to clear the hurdles for the NCD and so they're working through that. But the preponderance of the volume, that doesn't necessarily come from the new centers. They tend to \u2013 tends to come from existing centers.","Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Bruce M. Nudell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, just given the success of SAPIEN 3 in Europe, how should we be thinking about CENTERA, its key product advantages and whether you have balloon expandable pretty much to yourselves? Will this really be a good advantage \u2013 a good opportunity to take more \u2013 even more share?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're going to learn an awful lot about CENTERA as we go through our clinical trials, Bruce. And so that's going to be key for us and we're anxious. You know, generally we're so optimistic about SAPIEN 3, we think it's going to be not challenging and unlikely that people that are satisfied with SAPIEN 3 are going to switch over to CENTERA. But maybe people that are comfortable with self-expanding platforms are going to like the advantages that CENTERA offers versus other self-expanding platforms. So we'll have to see how that plays out. Again, we're in a rapid-learn mode. We did a fair amount of redesign of the delivery system on this new generation and we're just learning about that now.","Bruce M. Nudell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And just thinking ahead to PARTNER II, I'm presuming SAPIEN 3 will be part of that approval process. And following PARTNER II, if the trial is successful and shows even superiority relative to surgery, is there ever going to be another major U.S. indication trial?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know, it's a good question. It's too early to tell. It's being debated pretty heavily in the clinical community about what kind of clinical evidence becomes important. But it's just too soon. We don't have anything that's really solid to give you at this point, Bruce.","Bruce M. Nudell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks so much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks so much. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me okay? Sorry I'm at an airport.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure can, Danielle.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much. So, Mike, I just wanted to get some perspective on how you're thinking about market growth over the next 12 months to 24 months? I mean it just seems like we have so much momentum building behind the market here. You're seeing it play out in Europe particularly where the valves have been available for several years now and it's a more competitive environment. Yet you're still growing very healthily. And so I was hoping you could sort of provide some perspective on how \u2013 what \u2013 maybe let me ask you this way; what could derail the market from here? Or what could stop the momentum? Is there anything or is this level of growth sustainable for the foreseeable future?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Danielle, it's a good question. You know, we continue to think there's a large untreated population out there and that the market is going to continue to grow. And we think it's going to grow over a long-term basis because we have a lot of confidence in the fact that this therapy is going to be robust and continue to have future gains. Having said that, it's growing at some extraordinary rate right now, and I don't think there's any reason to expect that that kind of a rate can continue. As I mentioned, the comparisons are going to start getting tougher here in the second half of the year, and so the rate is going to come down but we think the market is still going to grow very nicely. This \u2013 broadly, this is the most studied class of heart valves ever, and the fundamentals remain strong. We continue to feel like this estimate that it's more than $3 billion by 2019 is very solid. And so it gives you some sense for how we feel about market growth.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. Thanks. And maybe to follow-up on that, one of the questions I get frequently is sort of, are intermediate-risk patients being treated aggressively in Europe and even now in the U.S.? And I'd love it if you could comment on that. I know you've commented in past calls, but any color there would be wonderful. Thanks so much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. One of the things that I thought was quite instructive is when we had a chance to see what a large group of intermediate patients looked like in the U.S. PARTNER trial, right? So here were a group of I think around 1,000 patients that \u2013 whose average age was between 81 years and 82 years old, and these were considered intermediate risk. And so it gives you a sense, I think at one time people used to think that risk as measured by STS would have translated to a younger group of patients. But there's a group that are quite elderly and quite frail that still have scores, STS scores and EuroSCOREs that are quite high.","And I think clinicians are using their judgment, they're looking at these patients, and they say, wow, considering their advanced age and their frailty and their comorbidities, I think I'll treat them. But I don't think you should be deluded to think that these are really healthy patients.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. You know, Mike, obviously the surgical valve revenue is holding up well per your guidance. Do you feel like the underlying market is healthy? Or are you taking share from competitors given the referral base and things that are going on in the market?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks. We think that was really noteworthy this quarter, Ben, the fact that in a quarter when we really had pretty explosive growth in transcatheter heart valves that our surgical valves grew really well. And we think the primary reason is that there were just plain more procedures done and that as the market leader we got more than our fair share of that. We may have picked up a little bit of share. I think we're picking up share in places like China. But \u2013 and I know \u2013 I think, we're doing pretty well actually around the globe. But the biggest component of this is really the market. We think that more procedures are happening.","Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","For my follow-up, can you talk a little bit more about Japan and how the launch is going? We're a few quarters in now, put back on track and is there a chance for upside there as people start to get exposure to the therapy more broadly?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. You know, as we mentioned, we got growth this quarter versus the fourth quarter, but it's still off a very small base. So it's not something that's really lifting us very much in that market. As we mentioned before, the adoption rate is probably slower than we originally anticipated. We got this more challenging credentialing process. We're working really hard to drive therapy adoption. We think it's going to be helpful when we pick up these additional valve sizes that are coming up here. But we continue to think it's an attractive marketplace, that it's going to grow to this $300 million to $400 million range yet this decade, by 2019. So we're optimistic about it, but it really hasn't taken off yet.","Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","James Francescone - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. This is actually James in for David. I wanted to follow-up on a comment that you made earlier. You broke out some math that you did on share in Europe, that now you think that some of the newer competitors in that market have about 10% procedure share. Do you have a sense of if you were to look at that a year ago where you think that metric would have been? And to what extent do you think that the share is coming from Edwards versus coming from the other large established player in the market?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good question, James. Yeah, I wasn't talking more about \u2013 I wasn't giving a forward-looking statement about where the newer competitors were. This was more of a look at the quarter. We believe that the newer competitors represented about 10% of the procedures in the quarter. If you were to go back a year, it was less than that. I don't know what it was exactly. It was probably closer to 5% than 10%. And we think there may be a little bit of that that came from Edwards, but we think that it's been moderate. We actually have done quite well on market share overall in terms of holding.","James Francescone - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then second, just on operating expense leverage, SG&A percent of sales this quarter in the 34%s, which I believe is among the lower numbers you've posted for quite some time. Going forward, how important is driving operating expense leverage versus investing to support growth in the business? And when do you think \u2013 or what's the year that you think we may see an inflection in terms of operating expense leverage in the P&L?","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure. It's Scott. I'll jump in here. First, we've been focused really carefully on trying to drive leverage in the P&L, but we're also being thoughtful about investing in two other areas. One is making sure that our operations are positioned to meet all the requirements we need to make \u2013 to meet, and also to make sure that we are positioned to produce based upon the increased demand that we're experiencing. And so that's causing us to incur more expense at the operating line. In terms of the other piece, it's really R&D, and we're going to continue to invest in R&D because we think we're getting very attractive returns on those investments. I think where we'll probably see some more leverage over time is on the SG&A line, and I don't think this quarter is necessarily a perfect indicator of where we're going to come out. We still think SG&A for the year is going to be something more like 35% to 36%, but I can just tell you that we've got plans in place to leverage our scale and leverage the investments we've made in platforms like THV, and we'll continue to see improvement over time.","James Francescone - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan Chase. Please proceed with your question.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So two quick follow-ups. So, Scott, why do you think SG&A as a percentage of sales goes up over the balance of the year?","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","A couple of things. First, we expected some additional expenses in Q1 that we now believe we'll realize in Q2. Part of that is relating to ramping up for THV launch of SAPIEN 3 in the U.S. Part of it is relating to normal seasonal increases that we experience in Q2.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, Mike, I want to go back to, I think it was, Raj's question, just you commented about just the U.S. market, which obviously had this moonshot last year after the data at ACC, the SAPIEN XT approval and your competitor coming in. And then it seems to have flattened out at a much higher level over the last couple of quarters. Can I ask the question since we're all here post-ACC, so kind of early indicators; has the market picked up on the back of the data we saw just a few weeks ago?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I don't think we've anything new to share in that regard, Mike. I think, we \u2013 our guidance that says now we're at the high end of this 25% growth on an underlying basis for the full year incorporates our best thinking, so we're not signaling at some inflection point in the U.S. market.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. But in order for that to occur I would assume you're expecting that there will be sequential growth over the balance of the year. That would seem the \u2013 the math would seem to imply that, right?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think there's probably some sequential growth in there, Mike, but I don't think that it's like we \u2013 probably what we sequentially experienced in 2014.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, understood. Okay. Thank you, guys.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brittany Henderson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. It's Brittany Henderson in for Kristen. Just wanted to ask a quick question, just on the heels of ACC and seeing all of the positive data, is there any update around the intermediate risk portion of the trials for both SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN XT? Is there any way that that approval could come sooner than expected?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Brittany, I want to make sure that I understand your question. You're asking do \u2013 when do we think we might get the intermediate risk cohort of SAPIEN 3?","Brittany Henderson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So yeah, there's a couple of things that still have to happen first. The short answer is we're really not changing our guidance. We think that that's most likely out to be towards the tail end of next year. The intermediate cohort for SAPIEN 3 has not yet reached its one-year endpoint. The XT that was studied in the PARTNER II trial has not yet reached its two-year endpoint. So we think that it's going to work through its normal course at this point.","Brittany Henderson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. I think we heard that SAPIEN XT two-year data is going to be published. Do you have any visibility on when that might be and possibly what medical journal?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me take a look here, Brittany. I'm not positive. I believe that it's been submitted, but I'm not sure what the journal is. So we'll have to get back to you on that one.","Brittany Henderson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. That's it for me. Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.","Kevin T. Strange - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. This is Kevin Strange in for Bob. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe as my first question just on competitive dynamics in Europe, it's only been a couple of months, I know, since your competitor launched their recapturable device in Europe. I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the field there? And then maybe just on repositioning (45:53) ability broadly, there's about two or three players in the market in Europe that have that feature, and just in the field as you talk to clinicians, how important do you think this feature is going to be going forward?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. In terms of \u2013 I think your first question, is it related to Medtronic's Evolut R?","Kevin T. Strange - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's correct.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So at this point it doesn't appear to us that it's fully launched. It appears that they seem to be going at a different rate from country to country, so it's difficult for us to gauge. But we don't think that it's out there in a large way yet. So it's difficult for us to have a firm view of how it's being perceived. And in terms of other competitors, they are gaining ground. I think the larger strategic guys are probably doing a little bit better. Overall, I mean, I think what's most noteworthy is just how well the SAPIEN 3 valve is growing. I think, the data pretty much speaks for itself and so it seems to be holding up really well under the new competitors.","Kevin T. Strange - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on mitral data, you mentioned that we might see some data later on in the year at large medical meetings. Can you give us a little bit of a preview in terms of what that data might be at PCR or later in the year at TCT in terms of it's going to be more compassionate use data, is this going to be registry data, number of patients? Anything along those lines would be helpful.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks. We've tried to move away from doing compassionate use patients to instead enrolling patients in our registry. And so I think what you're more likely to see presented, at least on our side, might be an update of what's going on in those. I think our competitors are probably doing the same thing. I don't know how much experience there is out there. I would imagine that we have probably more experience than most, but you'll get a chance to see how much clinical experience there is. But we're still at this very early stage in transcatheter mitral valve.","Kevin T. Strange - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Hey, thanks. Mike, in your prepared remarks you called out some softness, or maybe I shouldn't use the word softness, but impacting 1Q was the lack of CAP sales. And I think the CAP you're referring to was SAPIEN 3. So, can you give us an outlook as to when the CAP starts enrolling and the impact that it may have on the year. Then I've another follow-up on SAPIEN 3.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. What I was referring to is, recall that we got approval to use SAPIEN 3 in intermediate use patients in a continued access registry. That, it was 1,000 patients and we expected that to begin, and actually we thought it was going to start contributing to sales in the first quarter and it turned out to have a very moderate impact. It got a slower start than we anticipated. There were a couple of things that made the whole documentation slow. One is that we needed to do new contracts with each of the hospitals. Then also, we're now using the TVT Registry to collect that data and that added a level of complexity. This has gone slower than we thought. We expect it to start picking up here in the second quarter and that to be exhausted during the rest of this year.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And is this what's giving you confidence to guide to the higher end of your range for overall SAPIEN sales?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it helps to some extent, but it's probably our strong start, and coupled with our strength in Europe it gives us a lot of confidence, Glenn.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Then just to clarify the SAPIEN 3 comment for revenues in the fourth quarter, you're saying $10 million, but not to model $10 million. And is that because there's going to be swap-outs of XT that serves as an offset?","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Right. So it's Scott. Yeah, modeling $10 million in net revenue is probably good assumption. That's net of the swap impact, assuming it all happened in the same period. The issue is there are also expenses associated with potentially swapping out the product and by the time you get down to the bottom line in terms of earnings, it's really not going to have any impact in that period.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So, I can put $10 million in SAPIEN 3 in the model, but don't have it fall to the bottom line?","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","That's right.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, Scott.","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","And again, that's based on a lot of assumptions, like we get approval on the first of the quarter, but that's a fair modeling assumption.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one just about the mechanism by which you think you're going to get earlier approval for SAPIEN 3 and whether that informs your ability to get early approvals for anything else?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So with the SAPIEN 3 approval that we're talking about is the high risk indication. Each PMA is truly unique. In this case, I think, there's a good feeling that in this group of patients, which is a heavily studied group of patients, these high risk patients, that you learn an awful lot with 30-day data. And FDA is I think taking that seriously. When you couple that with the strength of the data and then just the encouraging discussions that we've had, and the fact that we're deep in the discussions also helps inform our feeling, our guidance at this point, that's what has us believe that. I don't think that on a wholesale basis that we should start assuming optimistic approval times on other future products.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. And I guess just because the ACC data was very good, can you talk about expectations for Medicare to revisit their policies at any point in time in terms of the centers that are allowed to do TAVR, whether there may be any changes to the overall coverage guidance?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So overall, we would expect that there's not going to be probably any changes in 2015. Beyond that there's always a possibility that they open up the national coverage determination. Usually that's preceded by a panel. So I think there would be some warning before that would happen. We would generally be supportive of anything that would open up access to more patients, but we don't see that it's clear that that's going to happen in the immediate future.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot for your time.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up. One clarification; you raised the Transcatheter Heart Valve guidance to the high end of the range, but I didn't hear you talk about the underlying growth for overall sales. I think on the last call it was 7% to 15%. Should we assume that the guidance now is for the high end of that range?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think yes, you should. Yes, we \u2013 that's the way to think about it.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So that still holds, the 7% to 15%, Mike?","Scott B.

Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found on our press release, on our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, all of which are available on our website at edwards.com.","Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying and excluding special items, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release and on our website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, David, we're very pleased to report strong third quarter results driven by total underlying sales growth of 14% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 34%. Strong bottom line growth was aided by our foreign exchange hedging program which provided a benefit that's offset the strengthening dollar in 2015.","Adoption of our SAPIEN 3 Transcatheter Valve System continue to propel our growth which exceeded our expectations. We remain optimistic that transcatheter valve procedure adoption is still at its early stages and the growing body of compelling clinical outcomes gives us confidence that with expanded evidence larger populations of patients suffering from aortic stenosis will be eligible for TAVR.","In Transcatheter Heart Valves, underlying global sales were up 29% over last year, led by growth of our market-leading products in the U.S. and Europe. Globally, average selling prices remain stable. In the U.S., underlying THV sales for the quarter grew 33% versus the prior year to $168 million. The contribution from clinical sales this quarter was similar to both last quarter and the year-ago period.","Our performance was driven by strong procedure growth and the ongoing SAPIEN 3 launch, and clinicians are rapidly adopting our best-in-class technology. We remain on track to have SAPIEN 3 in all of our existing accounts by the end of the year. Stocking sales are of minimal impact as we roll-out this product since the majority of our sites are on consignment contracts.","Outside the U.S., underlying THV sales grew 25% which was roughly in line with procedural growth overall. Our performance was once again driven by strong therapy adoption in Europe and the continued roll-out in Japan. In Europe, we estimate overall therapy adoption grew in excess of 20% in the third quarter, and our sales grew about the same.","Overall, demand remain strong as patients continue to come off the sidelines aided by growing therapy awareness and increasing trend of physicians referring more patients to TAVR, continued positive data, and favorable clinical experience. While we saw strong growth across the majority of countries, growth rates in some of the more penetrated countries moderated this quarter.","To summarize, our quarterly THV results, we are confident in our continued leadership in TAVR, even as competition increases. We are very encouraged by the strength of THV through the third quarter, and now expect our underlying sales growth in 2015 to be at the high-end of our previous 25% to 35% range.","Now, turning to other TAVR items. Expanding the indication to treat intermediate risk patients remains a key focus. We expect the data on both SAPIEN XT versus surgery, as well as well SAPIEN 3 intermediate risk cohorts to be presented at ACC in 2016. Assuming a positive trial and an expedited FDA review, we plan for a late 2016 U.S. approval with minimal contribution to sales next year. We expect our Continued Access Program for intermediate risk patients in the U.S. to continue until commercial approval. Assuming the intermediate risk data are favorable, we plan to use the U.S. data in a CE Mark submission in Europe.","Clinical evidence continues to be generated for our self-expanding CENTERA valve platform. Given the strong adoption and success of our SAPIEN 3 valve, we have reprioritized the timing of CENTERA, and now plan to launch in Europe in 2017.","At the TCT Conference earlier this month, data on high-risk and inoperable SAPIEN 3 patients at one year was presented. These data showed that recipients of the SAPIEN 3 valve demonstrated a high survival rate and low rates of stroke and paravalvular leak at one year. The presenter noted that these excellent results support the use of TAVR as the preferred therapy for patients at high or greater risk for surgical aortic valve replacement.","Additionally, one year data from the PARTNER II Valve-in-Valve study were also presented at this meeting. These data demonstrated high survival and low stroke rates for patients with prosthetic valves in need of replacement. We also announced FDA approval for SAPIEN XT in these high-risk patients.","Turning to the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Total sales this quarter were $188 million, up slightly over last year on an underlying basis. Against the tough year-over-year comparison, global Surgical Heart Valve units grew, but were mostly offset by the continued exit of non-strategic products. Overall, product prices were stable.","Sales of our premium products contributed to solid heart valve performance across all major regions. INTUITY Elite was a contributor to sales growth in Europe, and procedure volumes in Asia-Pacific and Latin America led the growth in the rest of the world. Our activities in support of the U.S. approval for EDWARDS INTUITY Elite remain on track and we still expect the launch in 2016.","In the quarter, we received FDA approval to begin an IDE study of our Magna valve with our new RESILIA tissue platform in young patients with congenital heart disease. This study will be led by surgeons at Boston Children's Hospital, and we believe this technology has the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in this underserved population.","In summary, growth in our Surgical Valve product group continued as expected in 2015, tempered by the planned exit of our non-strategic products. As such, we expect underlying sales growth will be within our 1% to 3% range in 2015.","Separately, a recent study has generated discussion regarding a subclinical imaging observation in bioprosthetic aortic valves. As you know, patient safety is our top priority. Both the FDA and a joint statement by two leading physician societies, the ACC and STS released last Friday noted the extensive clinical data supporting the use of transcatheter and surgical valves and recommended no changes to clinical care while we are engaged in further study.","In the Critical Care product group, total sales for the quarter were $132 million and grew 5% on an underlying basis. Global growth was driven primarily by sales in the U.S. with double-digit growth coming from our Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program across most regions. Our core Hemodynamic Monitoring products also recorded solid growth this quarter, and in Japan, we are now launching ClearSight in the fourth quarter, given the recent decision granting physician reimbursement.","In an effort to assist clinicians with enhanced surgical recovery, we recently entered into a collaboration agreement with CareFusion, a unit of BD. It is intended to connect Hemodynamic Monitoring Systems and Infusion Devices in a semi-closed loop approach to managing a patient's fluid levels before, during, and after surgery. Overall, we're pleased with the continuing adoption of our ESR products, which are still expected to grow in double-digits this year, and we continue to expect Critical Care underlying sales growth of 2% to 4% in 2015.","Now to update you on our transcatheter mitral valves. In August, we announced the completed acquisition of CardiAQ Valve Technologies. We're pleased with the progress we've made with the integration of the team and our FORTIS team into a single unit. Clinical experience with our mitral technology is our top program priority and we expect to continue enrolling soon.","As part of the integration, the development and clinical research of these two programs will be merged. Our lead program now referred to as the CardiAQ Edwards Valve will feature the CardiAQ Valve, which will be used in our CE Mark and U.S. early feasibility studies. Planned enhancements to this valve platform include additional sizes, delivery system refinements, and the addition of Edwards' clinically-proven bovine pericardial tissue.","We're also developing next generation transcatheter mitral valve replacement products that leverage both our FORTIS and CardiAQ experience. We are very excited about the promise of TMVR technology, and although commercialization timelines are still unclear, we continue to believe that TMVR will ultimately benefit more patients with mitral valve disease who aren't well served today.","Additionally, at the TCT Conference, details on the 13 first in human compassionate-use cases with our FORMA Transcatheter Tricuspid Repair System were presented. Clinicians participating in the early experience were encouraged by the early results with FORMA system, and noted that patients had positive changes in their heart failure symptoms and quality of life.","Many patients suffer from severe tricuspid regurgitation which is an under-recognized and under-treated condition associated with a poor prognosis. Plans are underway for an early feasibility study in the U.S. as well as a multicenter European and Canadian study. You should expect to see additional clinical updates at future medical meetings.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Mike. Another strong sales performance in Transcatheter Valves drove earnings per share of $1.07 this quarter. This represented 34% non-GAAP EPS growth over the prior year. Our non-GAAP sales were $617 million, at the higher end of our guidance range, and reflected nearly 14% underlying growth compared to last year. The strong U.S. dollar continued to have a significant negative impact on reported sales which grew 1.3%.","U.S. THV's non-GAAP sales of $168 million were lifted by $1 million related to the sales return reserve for the launch of SAPIEN 3. In addition, we partially reversed our reserve for the cost of SAPIEN XT products that won't be resold. The combined impact of the sales and inventory reserves increased our GAAP earnings per share by $0.02. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.07 excludes this impact.","I'll now cover the details behind our results including guidance for the remainder of the year. For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 76.2%, a 390 basis point improvement over the prior year. Approximately 220 basis points was attributable to favorable foreign exchange. Approximately, 110 basis points related to favorable product mix, and 60 basis points from other items including the impact of the THV sales return reserve. If foreign exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect our gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2015 to be approximately 75%.","Given the significance of foreign exchange contracts as a component of net foreign exchange this quarter, we thought it would be helpful to provide more specific detail for modeling purposes. Our third quarter gross profit margin includes hedge contract gains of $20 million, compared to losses of $3 million in the prior year period. This brings our year-to-date hedge contract gains to approximately $50 million. And if FX rates remain at current levels, we expect our hedge contract gains for the full year 2015 to be approximately $70 million, a substantial increase over hedge gains in 2014 of $8 million. At current exchange rates, our FX hedge contract gains in 2016 would be approximately $20 million.","Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses. Third quarter expenses decreased $10 million to $212 million or 34.4% of sales. This decrease was driven by the favorable FX impact on our expenses outside the U.S., partially offset by somewhat higher sales and marketing expenses related to Transcatheter Valves. For the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be comparable to the third quarter.","Research and development investments in the quarter increased 15% to $101 million, or 16.4% of sales. This increase was primarily a result of continued investments in our valve programs, including the recent acquisition of CardiAQ. We expect fourth quarter R&D investments as a percentage of sales to be comparable to this quarter.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $2.5 million, consistent with the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect net interest expense to be approximately $10 million. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 21.6%, which benefited from an improved country income mix. We expect our rate will drop to approximately 17% in the fourth quarter, assuming renewal of the Federal Research and Development Tax Credit. For the full 2015, we expect our average effective tax rate to be approximately 21%.","Compared to our July guidance, foreign exchange rates had a negligible impact on third quarter earnings per share. Given the recent strengthening of the euro, at current rates we now estimate an approximately $170 million negative impact of full year 2015 sales.","Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $176 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $202 million less capital spending of $26 million. Year-to-date free cash flow was $381 million.","At the end of the quarter, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.3 billion, which reflects a $348 million payment in the third quarter for the acquisition of CardiAQ. Total debt was approximately $605 million. We estimate fourth quarter diluted shares outstanding to be between 110 million and 111 million.","Now, turning to our 2015 guidance, all of which assumes current foreign exchange rates. For Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, due to our strong third quarter performance, we are raising our full year sales guidance to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. We continue to expect sales for Surgical Heart Valves at the lower end of our $780 million to $820 million range. And for Critical Care, at the lower end of our $520 million to $570 million range. We continue to expect total sales of between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion.","For the fourth quarter 2015, we project total sales to be between $620 million and $660 million, and diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be between $1.11 and $1.21, which increases our full year guidance to a range of $4.43 and $4.53.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Scott. In conclusion, our strong year-to-date financial performance demonstrates the strength of our market-leading product portfolio. We believe our strategy of focused innovation can transform patient care and drive value into the healthcare system and to shareholders. In light of the impressive body of clinical evidence, we're enthusiastic about the continued expansion of transcatheter-based therapies for the many structural heart patients still in need, positioning us for a bright future.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David K. Erickson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Mike. Before we open it up for questions, I would like to remind you to mark your calendars for the evening of Tuesday, December 8 and Wednesday, December 9 when we will be hosting our 2015 Investor Conference at our corporate headquarters in Irvine, California. This event will include discussions with key opinion leaders, updates on our latest technologies, and views on longer term market potential as well as our outlook for 2016. More information will be available in the coming weeks on our website.","In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and we'll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the hour.","Operator, we're ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Jason Mills of Canaccord. Please go ahead.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, Mike. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure can, Jason.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Super. First question just with respect to the U.S. TAVI market in SAPIEN 3 in particular. You mentioned that you expect to be able to service the full demand of existing accounts by the end of the year, but it seems like you made great progress during the quarter. Can you give us quantitatively the number of accounts that you were able to service with SAPIEN 3 during the quarter?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that in terms of the number of units sold, I think it was just under 50%, Jason. In terms of the number of accounts, I think it also was less than half. But you should in that assume that we probably got to some of the larger accounts first, if that's helpful.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","That is helpful. And my follow-up question is more of a longer term one. Clearly, what we've seen, investors have seen, is strong quarterly reports driven by TAVI, and we're waiting on, obviously, intermediate risk data that may expand that opportunity. At the same time, folks ask us a lot about the transcatheter mitral opportunity. So can you talk about the longer term growth of the company as you think about transcatheter valve, aortic valves over the next couple of years, perhaps maintaining strong growth, but eventually you're going to run up against a lot of large numbers and higher penetration rates? And also, juxtapose your thoughts on when transcatheter mitral might contribute to the P&L eventually, and sort of what that means for sort of a long-term, sustainable growth rate, both top line and the ability to leverage that to earnings growth over the longer term. I presume you'll touch on some of this at your Analyst Meeting, but we get the question a lot, so I just wanted to ask it.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jason. That's a perfect question. I'm not sure that I can do it full justice now. You're right; we're going to make this a key focus of our conversation at the Investor Conference. I think all of your observations are something that I agree with. First of all, is our transcatheter mitral's a big opportunity? Yes, it's a very big opportunity, but it is early, Jason, and I would just caution people to say, it's a little early to be talking about when sales might happen and exactly how big that would be. We really need to get more clinical experience. But as you know, we're very excited about it and we're focused on trying to take a leadership position in that field. Probably one that has less risk from our perspective is the opportunity for indication expansion in aortic. We think that we're only treating the oldest and sickest patients today, and with the marvelous results that we've seen clinicians get with transcatheter valves so far, we really believe that the aortics are a big opportunity in the future, and we're also going to try to bring that to life a little bit more. I would call that a lower risk, more certain long-term opportunity.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Mike, thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Scott, can you confirm, by our math the implied Q4 underlying growth in the guidance is about 7% to 14%. Is that accurate?","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Larry, it is close. It's sort of in the middle of that range. It's probably 10% underlying growth for Q4.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And recognizing that you're not giving guidance yet for 2016, Mike, can you just talk a little bit about some puts and takes on the top line next year, recognizing that you're not probably going to get an intermediate indication to the end of the year? And I did have one follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We've been really pleased at the way the U.S. and Europe have been growing. But I think as you've correctly surmised, both of those countries are going to be coming up against tough comparisons in 2016. And we have a tough time predicting exactly what's going to happen quarter-by-quarter. We've demonstrated that in the past. But we have a lot of confidence in the long-term. Probably the next time that growth really kicks up again is, once we get that intermediate risk approval. So we'll be trying to bring that to light more, Larry, when we lay it out, and I assume your question is primarily about sales growth. I think you probably have a pretty good idea. I don't expect any big surprises in surgical valves or Critical Care. Did that get to your question?","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes, it did. Thanks. That's very helpful. And Mike, so the STS database suggests that intermediate risk patients or STS 4 to 8 (25:22) represent about 20% of all surgical patients. It sounds like you think that opportunity could be bigger. Could you expand on that a little bit more, and how should we think about Europe? Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know what becomes difficult Larry is when you use the STS database to define the size of the population, you potentially run into a problem because it doesn't speak to about the number of patients that are on the sideline. We're going to try and work to bring that to life. These risk scores don't tell the whole story. And so, that's what I think is misinterpreted. I think it's a fair representation of who gets surgery, but it's not a fair representation of who is out there. And again, we'll try and make this a key focus of the investor conference to get a little deeper on that.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you for taking the questions. So let me follow up just on a couple of items. Of the discussion around the transcatheter mitral valve program was helpful. Can you just talk about your latest thoughts on timing of both the CE Mark study and the U.S. feasibility?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we're a little bit ahead of ourselves, Mike. The short answer is, we'll try and be a little bit more clear on the timing when we get to the Investor Conference. So we want to work through our operating plan process internally and be able to say something that we can have some level of confidence in. Know that, our top priority is to get clinical experience and we'd like to think that the CardiAQ Edwards valve is one that we are going to move forward with, for example, towards a CE Mark. But we're not ready to talk you about specific timing yet.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Then Scott, let me just rewind your commentary on the hedging gains this year that will roll off next year. So the math would imply that's about a 200 basis point headwind to gross margin next year, and about $0.35 to EPS. Is that how we should think about it?","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","That's right. Yes, 200 basis points for next year, but what's your $0.35? Are you talking about 2015 or 2016?","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, 2016 versus 2015. So if you've got $70 million of gains this year dropping to $20 million next year.","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, the GAAP, $50million is there something of that magnitude...","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Depends on...","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I think it's actually a little bit less than that Mike because you've got to tax affect the gains.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Tax affected U.S. rates?","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So it's a little bit less than that, then. Okay. That's what I wanted to clarify. Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Roman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. I wanted to just come back to the earlier question that was asked about sustainability of revenue growth in the THV market. Mike, in your prepared remarks, you made the comment that patients are continuing to come off the sidelines. I assume I think that was both Europe and the U.S. But if you think about the patients you're treating today, at what point do we start to dip into the prevalence pool, whereby today's revenue comes out of sort of tomorrow's opportunity versus actually sort of expanding that denominator from a penetration standpoint?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, there's a fair amount of \u2013 it's a really good question, David. And it's hard to know exactly those answers. It's probably more difficult to get at in Europe than it is in the U.S. In the U.S., you have a fair amount of discipline because CMS has an NCD in place, and they basically only reimburse for labels. So I think there is a lot of compliance for people to stay on a high-risk inoperable patient pool. In Europe, we know that physicians sometimes consider age, for example, where that wouldn't necessarily be in risk scores. But bigger picture, we're still just in the oldest and the sickest overall, and I think that there's a big opportunity in intermediate and even beyond intermediate, David, for there to be growth within this field. And again, we'll try and get into it in a higher level of detail.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. I know you'll give us more in December. And then Scott, just a follow-up on the FX commentary and a financial item. Obviously, you do have the headwind from foreign exchange rates, but I think is it reasonable to assume that there are offsets in there as it relates to potential mix benefit, and I know you had some manufacturing cost headwinds this year you talked about earlier. Maybe just help us think about the puts and takes on the gross profit line? For SG&A, this is simply a math issue with respect to what you're compensating people within Europe by assuming \u2013 and your G&A just getting translated back at a lower rate. So next year we'll see a more natural progression of your discretionary spending. And lastly, how are you keeping the tax rates so low, given the U.S. growing as a percentage of total sales?","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Well, let's start with the tax rate. In the third quarter, there was some country profitability mix that helped to keep the tax rate low. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to try to generate lower tax rate, but certainly there's upward pressure as we continue to grow our THV business in the highest tax jurisdiction. And SG&A, yeah, we've got the natural hedges built in, and I think that we're going to continue to see benefit from that as foreign exchange rates, if foreign exchange rates stay where they are today.","In terms of gross profit margin, yes, there was some mix shift improvement and we expect that that will continue. In terms of the operating expenses, we have incurred additional operating expenses over the last several quarters. I'd like to think that that abates and we're working really hard on trying to keep operating expenses down as the company grows. But I'm not counting on a lot of improvement on just the manufacturing expenses, because we'll continue to make investments to make sure that we're operating the way we want to be operating.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Rick Wise of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, everybody. Mike, you mentioned that growth in penetrated countries moderated, earlier in the call. Can you just expand on your comments there, and any color you could give us around what's happening, I mean is this the start of something that a process that would suggest that you are more penetrated in those markets, or is this because of competition \u2013 you often speak about competition on the call, you didn't say much about it tonight?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks. Rick. Yeah, I'll tell you what I was trying to do is just provide more clarity if possible. It's too early to signal a trend of what's happening in Europe. Growth continued to be strong. We are in excess of 20% growth in the quarter. But we just tried to provide you with a little bit of color because we normally draw that question in terms of what do we see across the continent. And what we saw, and it was really a small minority of countries, but some of the most penetrated countries the growth rate started to drop, and at the same time in some of the less penetrated countries the growth rate picked up. So it sort of netted out pretty similar to what it's been doing earlier in the year. But it's a phenomenon; it might be a signal that, as comparisons get tougher, things slow down. But we're watching it very closely; probably the next thing, again, we've seen growth move in spurts when intermediate risk would actually come to Europe and that might not happen until 2017. You might think that there would be an uptick in growth at that point.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know what I said. But I meant to say 2017 in terms of when it would come, right?","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. You did.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Turning to some of the hot topics at TCT, obviously, the Lazy Leaflet thrombus issue was a noisy one there. I left feeling encouraged that just talking to a lot of physicians that this was not going to be any near-term or longer term hindrance to TAVR adoption. I was also concerned about any possible impact it might have on intermediate risks time-to-market from an FDA perspective. It's been a couple weeks. You had an opportunity to talk to folks and think about it yourself. Just your latest thoughts on that issue, is it an issue, is that the right takeaway? Thanks, Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Rick. A good question. Yeah. This whole conversation around the imaging observations are one that, obviously, we watch very closely. We were gratified that the two main societies that have been engaged in heart valves, the American College of Cardiology and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons put out a joint statement, as a matter of fact, just this last Friday. If you haven't seen it, it's posted on their website. That speaks for this issue, and it's a good, solid comforting message for patients that cites the facts that there's a lot of data that supports the use of this technology and their practice should not change until there's more data. And we're certainly committed to study this. So having said that, we, at this point, have not detected any impact on our results in the Transcatheter or Surgical Heart Valve business related to the issue.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And you're concerned about intermediate risk, I mean, it's not a concern.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think this even came up during the Town Hall discussion at the TCT, and I think even members of FDA agreed that this wasn't a key concern of theirs as they consider intermediate risk. And that would make some sense, Rick, because we're generating an awful lot of data. Good hard core scientific data that supports the approval of these products.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hello, good afternoon. Mike, just on the low risk trial strategy, at TCT, Larry made a case for randomized trials at TCT. Can you just give us your sense of why you think randomized trials are better than objective criteria trials, and can we expect to get an update on that in December? And then I have a quick follow up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, David. Well, number one, we would expect to have a conservative FDA when it comes to expanding the indication for Transcatheter Heart Valves. They're going to want to feel that there's good solid data that supports it, and there's not much more scientific rigor than you can get in a randomized study. I think some of the reasons that Larry feels, let's \u2013 we ought to pause some before we go to an OPC, is to wait to have our field mature some. If you were to lock in an OPC for example, today, let's say you would have locked that in back when the SAPIEN valve was approved. Then all valves would have been compared to that valve and I'm not sure that would have served the public very well. As our technology matures and gets better, it probably starts moving to a place where it gets a closer to you say, it's at steady state and that's what you should expect from all heart valves. That's why we \u2013 Larry, would have said what he did.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then Mike, the other dynamic that came out of TCT, just wonder if you can give us a kind of two part answer here. One, how is S3 comparing in the U.S. you think versus Evolut R and your chief competitor has sort of suggested that they are not going to add any new centers here probably for the next six months as they look to train around their new product launch. So just quick dynamics of S3 versus Evolut R in the early days, and do you believe that that dynamic from your chief competitor impacts your next three months to four months and was it factored into the fourth quarter guide? Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Thanks, David. Well, it's tough for me to know exactly what our competitors doing and, since they are sort of off cycle, we're going to learn more about that when they report in another month or two months. But we can say that we're right on track with our SAPIEN 3 rollout. We've been really happy with it. And actually the results for SAPIEN 3 in the U.S. have probably exceeded our expectations. So overall, we're feeling good about things and it hasn't been so much about competitors, it's been our ability to get out there and supply.","One thing that I will note that happens as we do a roll-out often what we'll watch our customers do is to do several cases in a row. So rather than if there might have been a customer that might have split their case load, instead they might, for example, do 10 cases in a row and pull it forward. So those are, kind of experiences, and those experiences have been really positive.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Raj Denhoy of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Raj.","Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Wonder if I could follow a bit on the mitral questioning. One of the things that's kind of intriguing is your commentary around the changes you look to make to the CardiAQ technology, the leaflet changes and the various sizes and things. And I guess, the question is when you think about moving the valve into the clinic both in the United States as well as the U.S. trial, do you expect to make those changes before you begin or you will take the current generation into the clinic?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think our view is, and obviously this needs to be carefully worked with our clinical investigators and the FDA, but I think our current view is that we would proceed forward immediately with what we have, and that as we're able to add sizes, as we're able to add the Edwards tissue, as we're able to improve the delivery systems that we would cut those in along the way.","Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then second on the Valve-in-Valve approval for XT that came out of TCT as well, maybe could you just frame your expectations around what that could mean in the quarters ahead for your performance?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's hard to know exactly how many valve and how large that Valve-in-Valve opportunity is. It's relatively small, Raj. It's really important to these patients because they don't have great options, and they're at high-risk for surgery to go through it. So I would very much call that a niche, and wouldn't count on that to be in itself a large driver of growth.","Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Mike, I was wondering...","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","...if you can give a little bit more color on U.S. SAPIEN sales. They did come in better than expected, and I remember a year ago, there was a lot of warehousing of patients waiting for SAPIEN XT. So my question is, with respect to SAPIEN 3, was the strength, was there any warehousing. That's question one. And then, I do recall of asking on the last call if there was any like ACC bump, all the good data coming out of ACC in the spring, you didn't think it'd happen in 2Q. Was there any ACC bump? And I'm assuming part of the strength was market share taking. But just any more color, that would be helpful.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah .I understand your question perfectly, Glenn, and we look at that very carefully. It's difficult for us to put our finger and say exactly what's happening. The data's been a big positive and it's definitely gotten people's attention and we think it's made this valve very popular. And we even had Howie Herrmann from the stage say that this was a preferred option for high-risk patients. I don't know about warehousing patients, but we did see this phenomena that I just spoke about a minute ago, in which when accounts were starting on SAPIEN 3, they would try and do a number of patients in a row. So might they try and do two patients or three patients or four patients within a couple of day period? Yes. Might they try and do 10 in a row to get the sort of their feel for the system and get really comfortable with it. Yes. Could that have had had some impact on our results? It might have, but it's difficult for us to say.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just as I think about 4Q and U.S. SAPIEN sales, the numbers should be higher. So you are assuming a sequential growth going into the fourth quarter, and a higher U.S. absolute number, correct?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we would expect our Q4 sales in SAPIEN 3 to be larger than our Q3 sales, both for a couple reasons. One is, there is the natural seasonal differences. And the other is, we'll be continuing on our roll-out.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matt Keeler of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Matthew J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. I wondered if you could comment a little bit on the SAPIEN 3 launch, and you talked in the past about being able to expand capacity versus XT. I was wondering, if you could put any metrics around that for maybe your busier centers in Europe, sort of how much were they able to increase capacity?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks, Matt. It's a good question. It's so center specific, it's tough for us to generalize. It is true, we consistently hear this message that their capacity increases. They're able to get more cases done in a day. To be able to give you a good, hard number or an easy modeling numbers is tough for us. It is driven by shorter procedure times and so that just affects people differently. So I'm sorry, I can't give you a more specific answer.","Matthew J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. And just on the U.S. TAVI number, was there anything different in the royalties that really inflated that or was it pretty consistent with the last quarter?","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Matt, it's Scott. It was pretty consistent. It might have been $1 million more than a year-ago quarter, but really you should think about $40 million, maybe a little bit higher on an annual run rate basis.","Matthew J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matt Miksic of UBS. Please go ahead.","Matthew S. Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions. I have one follow-up for Scott and then one for Mike as well. On the margin question, and the impact of FX hedges next year that you talked about, is it fair or \u2013 I understand you're not giving a lot of detail yet about 2016, but is it sort of fair to expect, this year you had 200 basis points or so in this current quarter, plus the positive mix benefit of growth in TAVR, is it fair to think about next year as having this sort of 200 bp hit, then sort of offset by some continued mix benefit of a similar magnitude? Is that sort of the right way to think about the puts and takes for margins at this point? And then I had just one follow-up.","Scott B. Ullem - Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. That's a fair way to model it. A couple of hundred basis point difference in FX contract payouts offset by \u2013 partially offset by some mix improvement, which we will expect to continue.","Matthew S. Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And then Mike, you mentioned tricuspid, and some of the recent survey work we've done and conversations we've had with docs continues to kind of come up a little bit, I don't want to say wishy-washy, but just sort of like, we see this interesting, very interesting opportunity and underserved population as you do. However, maybe because it's underserved or under-diagnosed that clinicians at least the ones we talk to, many of them are sort of \u2013 they wouldn't put it on the list of bigger and more interesting, exciting opportunities. And I just would love to get some more color as to what you see that's exciting or interesting or potentially attractive here about pursuing that tricuspid opportunity.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. And Matt, the points that you raised and the questions or the comments by physicians are completely understandable. This valve is often called the forgotten valve and very rarely do people treat a tricuspid valve on an isolated basis even when it is treated, and I think it's around 8,000 times a year today. It's usually accompanied by a treatment of the mitral valve. The question here is, we know that these heart failure patients, lots of them, and I think by our estimate 1.6 million patients also have tricuspid regurgitation, and if you were able to address it, and able to do it in a relatively safe way, could you change the quality of these patients' lives, and that's what's exciting to us. We have certainly physicians and internal folks that could tell you all the clinical reasons why that could and should be true, but the only way we're going to know it for sure is to have clinical experience. What we are encouraged by is in these first few cases, we just so far have only talked about 13 of those, the clinicians are saying, hey, it looks like our patients are feeling better. And so that's what encourages us to keep going and try and learn more, but it is too soon to know how important this might be.","Matthew S. Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Mike, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more in the U.S. on the mix between inoperable and high-risk, how penetrated are we in those segments and how much incremental penetration is there to go in both of those?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. It's a good question. Frankly, there's not a lot of data on the answer to your question. We know a lot about the patients that get surgery. We don't know a lot about the patients that are on the sidelines. Closest thing we're able to do is we're able to get patients that get echoed in hospitals, and see how often they're treated, those kind of things. But we don't know how many people are out there that are just simply not being treated either because it's not diagnosed, or their primary care physician just doesn't feel like they should refer or even if they make it to a cardiologist, the cardiologist would say, I don't think I should treat this patient. And so it's a number that's not well-known. We work pretty hard to try and get an estimate there. We'll try and talk about this more at the Investor Conference. There is some relation here that's probably pretty dramatic in the elderly, where, as you get older, the percentage goes up we think markedly and we'll try and bring that to life.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just following up on that, as we think about intermediate risk potentially coming online here in the U.S. and Europe, late 2016-ish timeframe, what about the center capacity issue, because you're obviously not really adding incremental centers at this point, so really it's existing centers doing more procedure, there is going to be an influx of patients. How do we think about how the centers can manage that influx of patients? What can they do logistically to take on that incremental volume? Thanks so much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks Danielle. It's a good question. It's been handled different ways at different centers. Clearly, they're going to get more capacity. They're getting better at it. They do more procedures per day. They're able to get their patients out of the hospital faster. All of that definitely impacts their capacity. But if they get a real step-up in volume, they have decisions to make on whether they're either going to repurpose some room that they feel is underutilized or whether they're going to build capacity. What's encouraging is that the economics that are associated with transcatheter heart valves are pretty good at most centers and I think it makes it a reasonable investment for them to tackle the capacity expansion.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Josh Jennings of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening. Thanks a lot. I just wanted to follow up on David Lewis' question earlier just on the low-risk opportunity and coming out of TCT and the FDA Town Hall meetings and maybe some discussions with the FDA, any sense in terms of when we can learn about the path forward for low-risk and what that trial design may be? Do we have to see intermediate data first? Could we hear it in December, or would we have to wait until ACC or beyond next year?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's a good question, Josh. We will talk about it at the Investor Conference. It doesn't necessarily have to wait for intermediate risk patients. We're feeling pretty confident about intermediate risk patients. We'll have to wait and see what that data looks like. But we're thinking about that now and engaged in dialogue on that very subject right now with physicians and FDA and to see how we might tackle it. But stay tuned. We'll let you know if we have anything more definitive to say in December.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And just one follow-up if I can. On the CAP program, I assume you're going to finish the 1,000 patients this year. That's going to be extended into next year. I was just wondering, should we expect that to be another 1,000 patients added on in a CAP II like program or would it be more? And then also any other \u2013 should we be expecting, just in terms of building out our clinical revenues next year, any type of low-risk trial to be started? Thanks a lot.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, no, I think your first assumption is right, Josh. You should think about it in terms of being another extension. I think in fact it was a 1,000 patient extension. So our belief is that we will be asking for and get approved by FDA extension of the CAP program and that would continue until we have approval. That's our belief at this point in time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ben Andrew of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon, Mike. Just a couple quick questions for you. Can you talk about the mitral repair opportunity and how you all view that? And is it on a similar timeframe or different timeframe than perhaps the replacement product?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Ben. Yeah, we continue to think that for these mitral patients that it's likely that you'll need a toolkit, that there won't be a single product that will be the right technology for all patients. And so, we think repair has an important place in the future, and again, it's only clinical data is going to tell us that for sure. The timeframe is a good question. We think that timeframes could be very similar to the replacement timeframes. It depends on how far you are on the development of that technology. But there's no reason to think that it's necessarily either faster or slower.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just looking at the development of the market, both in Europe and the U.S., what are you seeing in terms of age evolution of the patients. Obviously, we all talk about high, intermediate low-risk et cetera, but are you seeing surgeons pushing into younger groups of patients or is that still sort of in the future with patient expansion? Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks. Right now, we continue to see that patients are elderly. You saw our intermediate risk data. Here it was, intermediate risk patients, we would have estimated early on that those would have been patients in their 70s. When we get into low-risk patients, they're in their 60s. And here it is our intermediate cohorts and patients are still in their low 80s. I think what we're seeing treated today are largely 80-year-olds and that there is a difference between age and risk, and this is part of what we're trying to understand and we're going to try and get a little different. So stay tuned for December.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, I just wanted to confirm, just with respect to the intermediate risk indication, you are going to be going to the FDA to get SAPIEN 3 approved for that, not XT, even though XT is the first, I guess, landmark trial, being that you're pulling XT off the market or phasing it out, I guess, I should say?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We just think \u2013 the way things have turned out, Kristen, is it looks like, coincidentally, we will have the results for SAPIEN XT in intermediate patients at two years and then also have the comparison of SAPIEN 3 to SAPIEN XT, and we'll also have those surgical patients and all that data becomes available at the same time. And if it's true, and we expect it to be the case that SAPIEN 3 is as good as SAPIEN XT, then naturally rather than go to an intermediate step, I would think that both we and the regulators would agree that we will go right to SAPIEN 3. So, all the data looks like it's going to come together at the ACC, and so it will be an opportunity to see the data in total, which includes the surgical control, the two-year XT in intermediate patients, and one year comparison of SAPIEN 3 in intermediate patients.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Are you confident that the FDA will allow you approval for SAPIEN 3 without two-year data on SAPIEN 3, or do you have two-year data somewhere in Europe on SAPIEN 3?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know about confident. I mean, overall, I feel good. I think it's very logical. I think SAPIEN 3 has a great track record. You've had a chance to see the data. I think FDA probably feels pretty good about it. I thought they press released it actually when we got our approval a little earlier this year. So I would think that they would say that that would be the right thing to do from a public health perspective.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. And last question I have, do you think a panel will be required as well? Is that included in your timeline when you say you'd expect approval at the tail end of 2015?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, our belief is that the data is so strong, Kristen, that we don't expect to have a panel. If we had a panel, that would be an unexpected event that would take more time.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Suraj Kalia of Northland Securities. Please go ahead.","Suraj A. Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. So, Mike, a quick question for you. We know the total number of sales in the U.S. and Europe and the trend lines. Let me ask the same question a little differently. Can you give us some directional color on average utilization per center in Europe, where it is, and I'm just trying to track where U.S. is relative to Europe, the trend lines, and see how much more room on a per center \u2013 average utilization per center do we have to grow?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Suraj. I don't have that data available to share with you. I can tell you just based on my understanding of Europe, you have a great disparity in sizes of centers. You have some just mega centers, for example, a number of centers in Germany that are really large, and then there will be other smaller towns and smaller countries that will have smaller centers. I want to say, the number of centers across Europe and Eastern Europe probably must be in the 400 range. But we don't end up using averages very much. We try and find other ways of modeling, just because there's so much differences from center to center.","Suraj A. Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.","And, Mike, my apologies if I missed this, did you all give an update on Japan in terms of the status on TAVI? Thank you for taking my questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks. No, we didn't give an update on that. In general, Japan has continued to grow. It's growing sequentially. Obviously, some big growth numbers year-over-year, but you would expect that at this early stage of the launch. We have plans to bring SAPIEN 3 to Japan at some point, although we have not changed \u2013 we haven't shared any specifics on it, and we're still the only company approved in Japan. We expect to have our first competitor I think in the not too distant future.","Operator","Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions.

We are pleased to report strong second quarter total adjusted sales of $1.1 billion, representing 14% underlying sales growth with balanced strength across all four product lines. Sales were lifted by a high teens global growth in TAVR, which reinforces our belief in our projection of a $7 billion opportunity by 2024. We continue to aggressively pursue breakthrough technologies with the potential to help an even broader group of patients and in turn drive significant future value. Given our first half performance, we have increased confidence that we will again achieve double-digit sales growth in 2019.","In transcatheter aortic valve replacement or TAVR, second quarter global sales were $678 million, up 18% on an underlying basis. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth. We anticipated growth would accelerate after the first quarter and our results this quarter exceeded our expectations. Globally, our average selling price remained stable as we continued to exercise price discipline. For the first half of 2019, we estimate global TAVR procedures grew in the mid-teens consistent with our guidance from the December investor conference.","In the US, our TAVR sales grew in the high teens and we estimate that our share of procedures was stable. We believe growth was stimulated by increased confidence in the therapy following the strong PARTNER 3 clinical results presented and published in late Q1. It was encouraging to note that growth was broad based across both high and low volume centers.","Nevertheless, based on our continued research, we are increasingly confident that there are many patients who would benefit from TAVR and who are not diagnosed, referred or treated today. We remain focused on our efforts to increase awareness and diagnosis, improve referral patterns and help patients receive the care that they need based on medical guidelines. Patients are continuing to be treated with the PARTNER 3 low risk continued access protocol in more than 30 high volume clinical trial sites. We now estimate that in the third quarter, the FDA will approve SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra for patients at low surgical risk.","Late in Q2, the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or CMS released the final updated NCD, which we believe better reflects today's practices and the needs of patients. We commend CMS on its thoughtful approach toward updating the TAVR policy. While the NCD did not achieve equipoise between surgery and TAVR, we believe the modernized requirements and more streamlined patient evaluation process are meaningful enhancements that should improve access for more patients suffering from severe aortic stenosis.","Outside the US, in the second quarter, we estimate total TAVR procedures grew in the mid-teens on a year-over-year basis with Edwards\u2019 growth being comparable. We continue to see excellent opportunities for OUS growth, as we believe international adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low. In Europe, we estimate that TAVR procedures also grow in the mid-teens on a year-over-year basis and Edwards\u2019 growth was comparable. We're continuing our launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra system in Europe, which we expect to account for a majority of our TAVR sales in Europe by year-end.","CENTERA was a limited -- was in a limited number of centers and did not contribute meaningfully to this growth. In Japan, we continue to see strong TAVR adoption driven by SAPIEN 3 and new centers are being qualified. We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country, driven by our belief that aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease along this large elderly population. ","As we discussed earlier this year, the landmark PARTNER 3 trial clearly demonstrated superiority of SAPIEN 3 over surgery in the low-risk patient population. A highlight was a low 1% risk of death or stroke at one year. Combined with prior robust clinical evidence, we believe a great majority of patients with aortic stenosis are ideally treated with Edwards\u2019 best-in-class SAPIEN 3 platform.","Given the pending approval for patients at low risk and the continued excellence and versatility of our balloon-expandable platform, we have made the difficult decision to discontinue the CENTERA program. While the CENTERA valve has demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes and is performing well for patients, the time and resources required to optimize deliverability as well as expanding the indications to max SAPIEN 3 are significant. Going forward, we believe we best address patients\u2019 needs by focusing resources on our robust pipeline of next-generation balloon-expandable technologies and indication expansion trials.","We continue to be pleased with the SAPIEN 3 Ultra valve performance, and throughout the discipline launch, our confidence has been reinforced by positive clinician feedback. Many clinicians have also expressed a preference for aspects of the SAPIEN 3 delivery system and we're working to incorporate those changes to optimize the SAPIEN 3 Ultra system. We expect physicians to continue to transition from SAPIEN 3 to SAPIEN 3 Ultra system around the world.","In summary, our year-to-date underlying sales growth in TAVR was 14% and we are raising our full year guidance to around the top end of our previous 11% to 15% range. Although the strategic decisions we made in the quarter resulted in a special charge, these decisions strengthen the execution of our long-term strategy. We are encouraged that the TAVR opportunity remains robust and continue to believe that our TAVR innovations will sustain our strong global leadership position.","Turning to Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies or TMTT, second quarter global revenue of $7 million was lifted by the continued rollout of PASCAL in Europe. In our early commercial experience, we remained focused on physician training, procedural success and great outcomes for patients. We're pleased with our progress as well as the positive physician feedback that we're receiving regarding PASCAL as a differentiated therapy. We also treated patients commercially with our Cardioband mitral and tricuspid annular reduction therapies and there have been improvement in supply as we continued transferring production to other Edwards\u2019 manufacturing sites.","As we advance our comprehensive portfolio, we remain focused on developing clinical evidence. We recently presented positive data on our mitral and tricuspid experience with PASCAL and Cardioband at the EuroPCR and TVT medical meetings. We're encouraged by the data from the CLASP study of the PASCAL system. At six months, patients experienced substantial MR reduction as well as clinically and statistically significant improvements in functional status, exercise capability and quality of life.","Looking ahead in mitral repair, as previously announced, we receive approval of our CLASP IIF pivotal trial for patients with secondary or functional mitral valve disease and plan to initiate enrollment in late 2019 and we continue to enroll in our CLASP IID pivotal trial to study PASCAL in primary or degenerative mitral valve disease.","In mitral valve replacement, we're pleased with the ongoing early feasibility study experience in both EVOQUE and SAPIEN M3 transseptal therapies and we remain on track to initiate a US pivotal trial of SAPIEN M3 in late 2019. In transcatheter tricuspid repair, we've gained significant clinical experience through our three simultaneous US early feasibility studies for PASCAL, Cardioband and FORMA. We believe that PASCAL and Cardioband can treat a significant number of patients suffering from tricuspid regurgitation supporting further optimization of our portfolio. We plan to initiate a pivotal trial using PASCAL in the tricuspid position late this year and plan to initiate a second tricuspid pivotal trial with Cardioband in the future.","Further, while we have experienced positive clinical outcomes for patients who've been treated with FORMA, we've made the decision to discontinue work on FORMA to support the acceleration of other tricuspid programs.","Overall, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities to treat patients suffering from tricuspid and mitral disease with our transcatheter therapies. We remain on track to achieve our 2019 milestones, including continued enrollment in our CLASP IID pivotal trial as well as planning to initiate three additional pivotal trials by late 2019. And you can expect to hear more updates regarding our one-year CLASP study data at the upcoming TCT medical meeting.","In summary, we remain confident in achieving approximately $40 million of total TMTT revenue for 2019. We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach approximately $3 billion by 2024 and are passionate about bringing a portfolio of solutions for patients in need.","In Surgical Structural Heart, sales for the quarter were $218 million or up 2% on an underlying basis. Growth was lifted by increased adoption of our premium high value technologies and strength outside the US. This was partially offset by lower surgical aortic heart valve procedures in the US as TAVR adoption expanded. Of particular note, the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve continued to grow in all regions with notable usage in more active patients who might otherwise get a mechanical valve.","Separately, we now anticipate that our Harpoon system, an echo guided beating heart mitral valve repair therapy, will be commercially available in Europe in late 2019 versus our previous expectation for a mid-2019 launch. The delay in timing reflects what we believe is generally a slower regulatory environment in Europe. We remain enthusiastic about this unique therapy and believe that it will offer the potential for earlier treatment of degenerative mitral valve disease, while providing faster recovery and more consistent outcomes for patients.","In summary, in Surgical Structural Heart, we remain comfortable with our full year underlying sales growth range of 1% to 3%. We remain excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and to extend our global leadership in premium Surgical Structural Heart technologies.","In Critical Care, sales for the quarter were $184 million and grew 9% on an underlying basis. All product lines contributed to this performance, boosted by HemoSphere sales primarily in the US and Europe. HemoSphere, as our all-in-one monitoring platform, is an important growth driver in 2019 and with the recent full market launch of the platform that includes our FloTrac sensor and our Acumen Hypotension Index software. This platform is designed to provide greater clarity on a patient's hemodynamic status, while introducing a predictive algorithm to improve decision-making.","In April, we successfully completed our acquisition of CASMED's FORE-SIGHT, a non-invasive cerebral oximetry monitoring technology. Sales of CASMED were $5 million in the quarter, integration is underway to enable the use of FORE-SIGHT on our HemoSphere platform. This combination will create a unique offering of enhanced recovery tools and predictive analytics capabilities to further strengthen our leadership in smart monitoring.","In summary, given the strong first half sales performance and the momentum from the recent HemoSphere launches, we now expect full year 2019 underlying sales growth of 8% to 10%, an increase versus our previous 5% to 7% projection.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Ullem","[indiscernible] Mike. Our top line performance this quarter was outstanding with underlying sales growth of 13.6%, reflecting strength in all four of our product lines across all regions. Particularly strong this quarter was our TAVR sales, which likely benefited from the recent clinical evidence supporting SAPIEN 3 therapy. Our adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter of $1.38 grew 11% over the prior year and was driven by our strong sales performance, partially offset by higher research and development spending, primarily in our transcatheter structural heart programs.","As Mike previously discussed, this quarter, we made strategic decisions regarding our transcatheter aortic valve portfolio, which resulted in a $46 million special charge primarily comprised of finished goods inventory. This charge combined with other adjustments reduced our GAAP earnings per share to $1.14. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.","I'll now cover the details of our second quarter results and then discuss guidance for 2019. For the quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.4% compared to 74.4% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven primarily by the favorable impacts from foreign exchange and product mix, partially offset by investments in our global supply chain expansion. We continue to expect our full year 2019 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%, although, we are expecting a lower benefit from foreign exchange than originally anticipated at our investor conference.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $308 million or 28.4% of sales. This 12% increase over the prior year was driven by transcatheter structural heart field personnel related expenses, including expanding the TMTT field organization in Europe, partially offset by the strengthening of the dollar. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items to be between 28% and 29% of sales for the full year 2019. ","Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 25% over the prior year to $192 million or 17.7% of sales. The increase was primarily the result of significant investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs, including an increase in clinical research for the PASCAL system. For the full year 2019, we continue to expect research and development, excluding special items, to be between 17% and 18% of sales.","Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate was 10.7% for the quarter or 12.0% excluding the impact of special items. This rate included a 530 basis-point benefit or $0.08 from the accounting for employee stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 12% and 14%, which reflects the continuing benefit of accounting for employee stock-based compensation.","Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter sales growth by approximately 2% or $20 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we continue to estimate an approximate $60 million negative impact or about 1.5% to full year 2019 sales compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 260 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our April guidance, FX rates had less than $0.01 impact on earnings per share, reflecting our effective currency hedging program.","Free cash flow for the second quarter was $277 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $341 million, less capital spending of $64 million. We now expect full year 2019 adjusted free cash flow to be around the top of our $800 million to $900 million guidance. We remain on track in implementing capital expansion projects in line with our strategy to increase global capacity and increase the robustness of our global supply chain.","Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $934 million. Total debt was $594 million. Consistent with the company's plans to offset dilution from equity-based compensation, Edwards repurchased 1.4 million shares in the second quarter for $250 million. Average shares outstanding during the second quarter remained level with the prior quarter at 212 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2019 to be between $211 million and $213 million.","Turning to our 2019 guidance, given our strong first half performance, we have increased confidence in achieving our expectations for financial performance in 2019. We are increasing the bottom end of our sales guidance ranges for Edwards and for TAVR. For total Edwards, we now expect $4.0 billion to $4.3 billion, an underlying sales growth around the top end of our previous 9% to 12% range. For TAVR, we now expect $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. ","We continue to expect TMTT sales of approximately $40 million and Surgical Structural Heart sales of $810 million to $850 million. We now expect Critical Care sales, including CASMED, around the top end of our previous $700 million to $750 million range. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $5.20 to $5.40, up from our previous guidance of $5.10 to $5.35. For the third quarter of 2019, our seasonally lowest quarter, at current foreign exchange rates, we project total sales to be between $1.02 billion and $1.06 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.13 to $1.23.","And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.","Mike Mussallem","Thanks, Scott. We're very pleased with our strong performance in the first half of 2019. As patients and clinicians increasingly understand the significant benefits of transcatheter-based technologies supported by the substantial body of compelling evidence, we remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity. Our foundation of leadership, combined with a robust product pipeline, positions us well for continued success.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Wilterding","Thanks, Mike. We're ready to take questions now. In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and management will answer as many questions as possible during the remainder of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Congrats on a phenomenal second quarter. I guess the first and obvious question is really on the TAVR growth acceleration in the quarter, both for yourselves and for the market. Can you just comment on what drove that acceleration? How much do you think that was actually low risk versus some other driver?","Mike Mussallem","There were multiple factors that probably contributed to the growth in Q2 and it's pretty hard for us to isolate each one. I'll remind you, there has been high variability in the past quarter to quarter. It just has not been uncommon in TAVR. Recall the Q1 growth rate was lower than the recent past and the second quarter here was certainly higher. You look at the first half in total and it was around 14% back in the mid-teens, but it was quite a difference between quarters and there could have been some seasonality associated with it.","But to add to that. I mean, to be fair, we believe that the growth might have been stimulated globally just by the increased confidence in the therapy, following the strong PARTNER 3 clinical trial results. It could have had several influences. There was a lot of awareness and publicity that could have encouraged treatment. It's possible that there's some borderline patients that receive TAVR. There was a minor increase and more cap. But what we are encouraged by particular, Bob, was that was broad based growth across the globe and that even in the US, it was in both large and lower volume centers.","Bob Hopkins","I just wanted to ask as one follow-up just on mitral. You're still guiding to approximately 40 million. You need to almost triple your revenue in the back half. So just -- can you talk Mike a little bit about what gives you the confidence that PASCAL can accelerate as much as you're expecting in the back half of the year?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah. So we weren't really focused on the numbers this quarter. Our early commercial experience, we just stayed focused on physician training, procedural success and just trying to get great outcomes for patients. The procedures did actually increase quite a bit over Q2 and it's possible that some of the Q1 sales actually was consumed in Q2. But we're pleased with the kind of feedback that we've gotten on PASCAL and we remain confident in achieving the $40 million guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Just two from me. Mike, just thinking about TAVR guidance for the back half of the year, it's pretty stable, frankly that's what we saw from a growth perspective in the second quarter. So is that how we should think about the business? Why should we not expect sort of further inflection or do you expect that after the approval an NCD? And then a quick follow-up.","Mike Mussallem","I'm not sure, I followed it exactly. You're saying, why shouldn't it be more. Is that the question David?","David Lewis","Growth rates, your back half top end of the range means back half of the year is consistent with the second quarter. So the question is, why do you not see further inflection or do not expect that until we see the approval or NCD?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah, we think it's premature. As you're well aware here, we've decided to discontinue the CENTERA program, so that won't be a driver of growth. We know that Boston Scientific is in the process of launching and we expect that to have some impact. So those are going to be some headwinds. And so we feel pretty good about where we guided things, David.","David Lewis","And then Mike just new competition was a big debate this year. So competition in the US from a third entrant, you suggested stable share this quarter. Was there any impact in the second quarter from new entrants? And how should we think about the second half of the year relative to new entrants? Thanks so much.","Mike Mussallem","It's always difficult for us to estimate market growth, but we assume that we -- that the growth in procedures overall and our growth was quite comparable. As it relates to Boston, it appears that they're executing a disciplined launch and that they're focusing on training and we expect them to get more active in the coming months. But we remain confident in our guidance.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Congrats on a really nice quarter here. Mike, just back on TAVR guidance for the back half. I just want to understand that, sequentially, we had 800 basis points of acceleration versus 1Q. Your comps did not seem like it was easier. And based on your comments, this was broad based, right? This was not just a US phenomenon. You saw this across the geographies. Your comments on Europe accelerating, I think that's the first time we've seen Europe, you guys being holding back to mid-teens in a while. And this is all happening before the formal approval, right? So back to, I guess, the question, 2Q was so strong, why shouldn't it accelerate post the approval in the back half?","Mike Mussallem","Thanks for that Vijay and I can understand how you do that analysis. But when you do the sequential look of Q1 versus Q2, we certainly expected Q2 to be stronger than Q1 from a growth rate perspective. The way it turned out -- Q1, we think turned out surprisingly low and there may be some reasons behind it that we don't fully understand that has to do with seasonality in the way the calendar fell. Q2 turned out to be even stronger. So I would caution you not to expect that kind of sequential growth on a routine basis. And so when we lay out the back half of the year, as I said, we would expect to get the approval sometime in Q3 and remember that Q3 is traditionally our slowest seasonal quarter as it is for our customers. And I mentioned without CENTERA and with Boston Scientific launching, we think that our guidance is in the appropriate place.","Vijay Kumar","And maybe one on the mitral side, Cardioband, I'm not sure I heard Cardioband being mentioned on what its contribution was for in TMTT? Is it being used in mitral because I certainly heard about tricuspid and the trial starts, but I'm just curious on Cardioband in the mitral area?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah, so Cardioband supply situation has improved. It was used in both the mitral and the tricuspid position, actually more tricuspid this last quarter. And so we're pleased to see that supply situation get better, so that we can allow some of our operators to really get in -- get to come down the learning curve and apply that on a regular basis. Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","And congrats on the really, really impressive quarter. One on the EPS guidance, one on Ultra. So if I'm doing the math right, Scott, EPS beat by the midpoint of the Q2 guidance by about $0.06, but you raised the fiscal Q2 -- fiscal 2019 EPS guidance by only about $0.07 at the midpoint. Why is that? And I had one follow-up.","Scott Ullem","So you're generally right about the math, Larry. This is, by the way, about $0.12 over our investor conference guidance. But effectively expenses and sales in the second quarter came in higher than we expected. And so as we look at the second half of the year, we're also expecting expenses to come in higher than we originally expected. Remember, we've got new pivotal trials coming online and some additional other R&D and SG&A expenses that go along with those.","Larry Biegelsen","And then Mike on SAPIEN 3 Ultra, do you think the balloon issues have been resolved with the update to the IFU? And are you now planning to rollout Ultra more aggressively? And could you provide a little more color on the SAPIEN 3 delivery system comments you mentioned in your prepared remarks?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah. What we expressed is, we're getting a lot of favorable feedback on the SAPIEN 3 Ultra valve itself and the way that that valve is performing. But we are seeing many clinicians also express a preference for aspects of the SAPIEN 3 delivery system. So we're working to incorporate those into the Ultra system. Ultimately, we think that that will have impact on the balloon issue. The balloon issue, we identified some factors that were associated with that and actually there has been less of that that have occurred with this SAPIEN 3 delivery systems. So we expect that to be a real enhancement in that regard.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","Two quick questions, I want to spend a moment on the international market, the pricing dynamics. And last quarter, we talked about stable market share in a slower market. This quarter, we're talking about stable market share in a faster market. And I'm just trying to make sure I understand what's going on here?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah, so we do think that OUS procedure growth did pick up in the second quarter. And, you did hear correctly that we feel like our growth was comparable with the market. So we didn't really see a share shift in our minds either last quarter or this quarter. And this is true year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Now exactly why it picked up is a little difficult to say. Our team would say that there was probably some positive influence that came from the PARTNER 3 news that came in the end of Q1.","Joanne Wuensch","And then I just want to also understand the impact of the continued access program in low risk and what you may think it helped in the second quarter. And how are you thinking about that for the second half contribution?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah, thanks. So that stays in place until there is an approval. The cap program in the second quarter generated a little more than the first quarter, but it was pretty small. It was minor. I want to say something maybe in the 10% improvement. So I think maybe a couple of million dollars.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan.","Robbie Marcus","Great and congrats on a nice quarter. I heard you mentioned comments that the M3 is moving into pivotal trials late in this year. I didn't hear an update on timing for EVOQUE. Can you just give us an update on, if you're doing implants in patients in both of those right now and the status for EVOQUE?","Mike Mussallem","Yes, we are doing patients with both systems. We've been really pleased with the feedback on both systems. We have, at this point, decided that we are going to initiate the SAPIEN M3 clinical trial before the end of the year. One of the reasons that we feel comfortable going first with that is because we have literally thousands of patients in which the SAPIEN valve has been used in the mitral position. So it gives us an opportunity to start there, but we don't mean to send a signal that we're not excited about the EVOQUE platform. We also feel great SAPIEN M3 is going to go first.","Robbie Marcus","And you gave some good color on what you thought about second quarter and maybe some of the drivers of growth there. But maybe just diving into the international markets a little bit and if you could break out Europe and outside of Europe. This is a market that's been doing low risk for a while, it's been growing mid-teens for an impressive number of years. What is it there that you're seeing in trends that drove the growth this quarter, well above the expectations? Was it less competitive pricing? Was it some change in competitive dynamics? Was it some markets doing better than others? Any kind of color you could give would be great.","Mike Mussallem","Sure. So I mean, this was a really remarkably level quarter for us in that we experienced double-digit growth really around the globe, and that was driven by TAVR. In Europe, in particular, what we have seen is that the less penetrated countries continue to grow faster than the more penetrated countries, but there is still ways to go. Europe is influenced to some extent by its reimbursement programs and so that's the key element of this. But I think, you said that there was already low risk in Europe. Actually, there is no low risk approval at the EU level that will probably come in 2020. But we do think that there were some influence from the PARTNER 3 data that appeared at the end of Q1 and that probably had some impact on the treatment of patients in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.","Cecilia Furlong","This is actually Cecilia on for Jason and thank you for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask about Japan and the strong TAVR adoption trends you've seen recently, juxtaposed with the current number of qualified centers in the region. And as you look forward, can you talk about the TAVR outside EU here and the leg work necessary to really open up the opportunity, what still needs to be done to increase the total number of qualified centers as well as establish and improve current referral patterns?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah, the growth rate in Japan has been nice and we've been pleased with that. But we are not pleased at all with the treatment rates in Japan. Given the large elderly population there, we would expect TAVR penetration to be much higher at this stage of the game and we believe that one of the reasons it's not higher is because it's really been limited in terms of the way their system has allowed centers to start up and that there should be more centers and the centers that are doing it should probably be doing more procedures. So we still have our work to do to make sure that proper policies are put in place and we are applying energy to do that. So although, Japan is nice, it's still a big opportunity for patients to be treated at a much higher rate.","Cecilia Furlong","And then just turning to Europe, I realize it's still very early in the process, but could you talk more about your ongoing PASCAL launch in the region and specifically the training programs that you're implementing, the learning curve associated with the platform and adoption trends within centers following initial utilization. And just what types of patients are you seeing the platform be used in initially as centers trial the device? And where does this expand in your view longer term?","Mike Mussallem","So early on here, we've really put a premium on making sure that the training was very well done that we have great procedural success that patients had great outcomes and that's been job one for us. It really hasn't been so much about the numbers. We've gotten a lot of great feedback. We saw the number of procedures really accelerate in Q2 and we are indeed adding centers in Europe during Q3 and Q4. So, you can tell from our projection that we expect to do around $40 million in 2019. And that's going to be primarily from PASCAL. So I think it kind of speaks for itself in terms of what we think the adoption rate will be.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.","Matt Taylor","So the first question I wanted to ask was, you mentioned it's a difficult decision to discontinue CENTERA. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that as it certainly implies a lot of confidence in SAPIEN 3, which you should have. But you're not going to have a self-expanding option going forward. And what does that do to you in terms of the additional flexibility or horsepower that you get from discontinuing that you could put behind PASCAL or some of these other programs?","Mike Mussallem","You're right, a lot of this was headlined -- the incredible body of evidence that exists on SAPIEN platform and SAPIEN 3 in particular and the way it performed in the PARTNER 3 data has just given us a lot of confidence and it's also placed a very high bar in terms of how systems need to perform. And although we are really pleased and excited about CENTERA, there is a number of clinicians as well and that valve performed well. The way that valve delivers didn't work as well in all anatomies as we would have liked. So it would have required us to make some enhancements to delivery system.","And at the same time, remember the CENTERA trial we're involved in now would only give us an intermediate risk indication that we would have to continue to do trials. So when we put that altogether and thought about where we're going to apply the resources of our team and how much confidence we have in the existing platform and how excited we are on future platforms, it was a tough decision, but we made it and decided that we're going to focus our resources on the next generations as well as the excitement we have around our existing platforms.","Matt Taylor","And then can you just spend a second on how you've kind of retooled the investments in mitral and tricuspid as kind of a follow-up to that and where are you accelerating these more -- you mentioned the PASCAL trial starting in tricuspid later this year. Maybe give us some info on where you're really trying to accelerate?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah. So a few things, one is PASCAL is really kind of going first on the repair side. So we are pleased, now we already had a program that was focused on these primary or degenerative patients and to be able to launch a pivotal trial for the functional or secondary patients we're excited about, because that's a significant group of patients that we're looking forward to treat.","On the tricuspid side, after a lot of deliberation, we decided that our first tricuspid trial should be done with PASCAL. So we made that call. You also heard that we decided and made the tough decision to discontinue the work that we have on FORMA. And so that one, we're in discussions with FDA in terms of what that trial design would look like. And so hopefully that gives you a sense, and at the same time, I think we just explained where we are on the mitral replacement with M3 going into a clinical trial late this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.","Matt Miksic","And I'll echo everyone's congrats on the quarter. So, I think one of the things that folks have been trying to get to on the quarter is sort of the strengths and what drove it and it doesn't sound like it was continued access per se. And I guess Mike, if you could elaborate, maybe it doesn't really sound like it was low risk patients that came in, but you said a few times awareness of and the impact of the PARTNER data. So is it -- I mean is it something like stroke risk or something that stood out or change the conversation for the, let's say, the intermediate risk indications or any kind of color that you can provide on -- how does awareness translate into volumes? And then I had one follow up.","Mike Mussallem","I understand the confusion and I wish I could point you to one thing that really drove this and I know this call feels a little bit like a birthday party, but it is -- there are a bunch of serious issues in here. We think that there was just plain variability between the first quarter and the second quarter. We believe that all of this data that was presented at the end of Q1 generated a lot of buzz, a lot of excitement and that people started moving through the system. We know that people don't move through the system that fast.","And so oftentimes, we think it could take 90 or 120 days, even more for people to move through it. So how much could have gotten stimulated and move in Q2 is a question mark. So again, we don't think it's about cap. We don't think there were a significant number of low risk patients that were treated in the quarter. We really think that it was just the stimulation of the overall number of TAVR procedures.","Matt Miksic","I understand it's difficult to pin down, but then a similar question heading into Q3 and again cap not -- let's just say not a factor, per se. Maybe talk about seasonality, I mean last year, you're down about 30 million or so sequentially Q2 to Q3. I think. And maybe what does cause that number to come down the way say it would need to come down sequentially in order to hit the guidance you've laid out for Q3?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah, it's a good question. So you know that Q3 is a seasonably slow quarter for our customers. And so that kind of goes without saying, it wasn't so long ago, I'll remind you, back in 2016, after we got the approval that Q3 was lower growth than Q2 and I'm not sure we fully explained exactly why that was the case, but it happened. And so it causes us to just stay thoughtful and moderate about what our expectations are. We expect to have approval. But again, if the approval does come, it\u2019s probably likely to come during one of the slowest times of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company.","Josh Jennings","Just two questions on low risk approval. First one is, what gives you confidence to kind of narrow the guidance range for approval timelines to 3Q. And should we be thinking about that -- could the approval occur just in the next week or should we be thinking later in the quarter in September? And then I just have one follow-up.","Mike Mussallem","Yeah, thanks for the question. I understand where you're coming from, Josh. So what happens usually as we go through questions back and forth with FDA and you can usually tell when the questions are winding down or when they're coming down to the final questions. And so it makes us feel we're pretty close. One of the things that's not clear is whether our approval would come at the same time or whether the FDA might choose to move two competitors at the same time could be a factor. So we're saying based on everything we know probably Q3, but we just can't be any more specific than that.","Josh Jennings","And just in terms of low risk approval in the label. I think you've been clear you don't expect any kind of exclusion of bicuspid, I just wanted to sanity check that, is that still your view. But to follow up on top of that is, I mean, could you have a labeling advantage in the early days of low risk approval? It's our understanding that the Medtronic bicuspid arm is still enrolling or just gotten started enrolling couple of months ago. Could you have an advantage in the bicuspid segment for a period until Medtronic gets that data together? ","Mike Mussallem","Yeah, I'll just remind the audience that bicuspid is not contraindicated today and we do not expect it to be contraindicated in the label or in the future. You saw Raj Makkar's data, which was quite encouraging. So I'm not sure it's going to be much of a competitive dynamic going forward. We feel comfortable that it will be treated in the future much like it is today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.","Chris Pasquale","Congrats on the quarter guys. So Mike just to start off with how close is CLASP IID to completing enrollment? Just trying to get a better sense for the regulatory timeline there?","Mike Mussallem","So we've been enrolling for a while. It's proceeding largely as planned. We're continuing to activate more centers. I don't think we have anything more to share on that. We really haven't laid out what we think it's going to take us. This is the first time that we've been engaged in a mitral transcatheter trial just like this. But it is going largely as we planned.","Chris Pasquale","Okay. Can you talk a little bit more about the tricuspid opportunity? We haven't seen a ton of data yet on these devices in that position, but you guys are moving ahead into two trials that suggest you're encouraged by what you're seeing. What types of patients you're looking to treat new studies? Is there going to be any difference in terms of how you set up the one for Cardioband versus PASCAL? Anything you can share there would be helpful.","Mike Mussallem","So this is really going to be new for these patients. Today, they don't have very much options. One of the reasons that we're enthused as clinicians are enthused and they say, we really could use a transcatheter option to be able to help these patients. As we mentioned earlier on the call, we actually have done three early feasibility studies in the tricuspid position and even though each of those systems behave differently, we've consistently heard back that patients really get an improvement in their quality of life following that. Now of course that's anecdotal we need to do that in a high-quality fashion. We really have not defined the clinical trial at this point. We're working with FDA at this point, but it's going to be some kind of a trial that actually compares it to medical management probably. And so it will be back fundamental.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy","I wonder if I could maybe get your thoughts on the NCD, the expanded NCD or the updated NCD that came out a few weeks ago. Any thoughts on what impact that will have on the market and are you seeing new centers already starting to gear up to start offering TAVR?","Mike Mussallem","So, we often think that the primary risk that have faced severe aortic stenosis patients is not the treatment complications, but the risk of not receiving treatment at all and we really commend CMS for a thoughtful approach that I think really is going to modernize the requirements and it will be more streamlined for patients. We know that there are a number of centers that are anxious to open TAVR programs and when we look ahead, we say it's reasonable to estimate that approximately 200 new sites could achieve eligibility to initiate a TAVR program by the end of 2020.","Raj Denhoy","And in that context, what's your sense on how expansive that will be to procedure volumes versus sort of cannibalizing patients that would have been referred previously?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah. We don't know this for sure, but based on our past experience, we think new centers often mean new patients. We think that often patients are trapped in the referral pathways and don't necessarily get referred out to other larger centers. So we think it is going to be additive. But overall, remember that we have an estimate that the overall opportunity is going to grow to $7 billion by 2024, which infers a pretty significant growth rate between now and then. And we think that's all part of it. The NCD kind of turned out the way we had hoped it would turn out and had planned for it to turn out. So not really outside of our existing guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.","Danielle Antalffy","Congrats on a really good quarter. And Mike, I wish it was a birthday party. But anyway, just a quick question on, you mentioned that a lot of these -- or you didn't say a lot. I'm sorry, you've mentioned that some of these patients might have been borderline patients, do you have any sense of how many patients would be considered borderline? And maybe to answer this question, do you have any -- a better way would be to look at age, any sense of where the age is creeping right now? Is it still about average age of 80? Is it moving well or have you seen in this quarter?","Mike Mussallem","I appreciate the favorable comments. You know what, we just don't have anything quantifiable. What we hear back is pretty anecdotal. So I really can't track it for you. The borderline patients we don't think was the majority, we think it was a factor. But we just think that for whatever reason, there was an acceleration. So we track what's going on in age, but that generally lags by a quarter or two. So we don't have a really clear handle on that at this time.","Danielle Antalffy","And then just a quick follow-up on Europe and following up on Joanne's question around cost and just wondering what's happening as you have conversations with some of the healthcare systems over in Europe because some of the feedback I got at PCR was, we love SAPIEN 3, but it's too expensive and we actually can't grow volumes, because we're limited by the cost of the valves, they need to get cheaper. What are you hearing, I understand you guys have been very disciplined about price, but not even as it relates to competition, but just from a volume perspective and patient access in Europe and how might you address that longer term?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah. We think some of the healthcare systems in Europe aren't fully prepared to pay for the quality and value that goes along with therapies like TAVR. Actually, I think when you compare with the value that it adds to the system, what it would cost to add a quality year of life and so forth, TAVR compares wonderfully with so many other therapies. We need to do a better job of influencing the policy makers about the importance of this therapy and that's really what's key for us. We can understand why physicians are in a tough place, they have to live within the existing reimbursement system, but we think in some cases, they don't fully reflect the value of the technology. That's our job to do.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.","Pito Chickering","Couple of questions. The first one, can you refresh us on the number of centers in the US that are using Ultra? What is the order rate for these centers on Ultra versus SAPIEN 3? And how quickly are you converting into 100% of Ultra?","Mike Mussallem","So, I don't know the number of Ultra in the US. It's a small number. We were further along in Europe. We didn't give a projection of how far we were going to be overall, we did say that we thought it would account for the majority of procedures in Europe, before the end of the year and that ultimately we think that the Ultra system will replace SAPIEN 3 in all geographies.","Pito Chickering","Okay. And then two housekeeping questions. What impact discontinuing CENTERA have in your gross margins? Now as you shift more valves into Ultra in Europe, how should we think about how that impacts your gross margins as they need to ramp up two production lines to full capacity?","Mike Mussallem","So you're saying, how is our gross margin impacted by the switch to Ultra from SAPIEN 3?","Pito Chickering","Yes.","Mike Mussallem","Yeah. We think that's pretty, it's pretty negligible. CENTERA would have been a more expensive system to make, but Ultra is comparable to the SAPIEN 3.","Mike Mussallem","Sure. All right. Well thank you everybody for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, Mark and I, welcome any additional questions by telephone. And with that, now back to you, Mark.","Mark Wilterding","Thanks, Scott and thank you all for joining us on today's call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Erickson, Vice President-Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Erickson. You may begin.","David K. Erickson - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our third quarter 2016 financial results.","During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Scott Ullem, CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and current expectations for clinical, regulatory, reimbursement and commercial matters, as well as trends in therapy adoption and foreign currency movements. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today.","Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in our press release, our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, all of which are available on our website at edwards.com.","Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying and adjusted, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release and on our website.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thank you, David. We're pleased to report strong third quarter underlying sales growth of 18%, which was consistent with our increased expectations. 2016 has been a remarkable year for our company with year-to-date sales growth rate of 20%, about double our original expected growth rate. This reflects continued strong global adoption of our SAPIEN 3 platform, which remains on track to generate over $300 million more in sales than we originally expected for the year.","During the quarter, we're also pleased to receive a number of important regulatory approvals in each of our business units to drive future growth. Consistent with our strategy, we are aggressively investing to bring breakthrough therapies to an even broader group of patients around the world.","In Transcatheter Heart Valves, global sales were $410 million, up 37% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the U.S. and Japan. Globally, average selling prices were stable in each geography.","In the U.S., Transcatheter Heart Valve sales for the quarter were $260 million and grew 55% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Overall, growth was consistent with our expectations with robust performance driven by continued strong procedure growth in both large and small TAVR programs. As expected, in mid-August, we received FDA approval to expand the use of SAPIEN 3 for intermediate risk patients, which is the first TAVR therapy to obtain this indication in the United States.","The high volume clinical sites already treating intermediate risk patients are under our Continued Access Protocol, and they have now transitioned to commercial sales. Enrollment continues in our PARTNER III low-risk trial, with more than 50 of our trial sites actively engaged. We believe this randomized trial should be enrolled by mid 2017, and we'll provide an update at our December Investor Conference.","Outside of the U.S., underlying THV sales grew 15%. We continue to be encouraged by the strong adoption of TAVR in Japan, with the rollout of SAPIEN 3 expected to be completed during the fourth quarter. In Europe, we saw strong procedure growth across the majority of countries. We estimate total procedures grew around 20% in the third quarter compared to last year. However, Edwards' growth rate was lower primarily due to reduced selling in France. We are pleased to be resolving the issue we described last quarter, related to the French policy that effectively limited the number of TAVR procedures in 2016.","Very strong therapy adoption caused the CAP to be reached during the third quarter, earlier than expected. As a result, we reduced shipments in the third quarter, which impacted our sales by about $5 million. Fourth quarter results will also be impacted as we have just now resumed shipments and expect to return to a near normal run rate by year-end. Our 2016 sales guidance reflects the current situation, and we are working toward a long-term resolution for 2017 and beyond.","Also during the quarter, we received an intermediate risk indication for SAPIEN 3 in Europe. We continue to anticipate gradual expansion into these patients as clinical guidelines are revised and reimbursement policies are updated. We continue to expect that our new Ultra system, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, will be launched in Europe in the second half of 2017.","We anticipate routine clinical updates on our SAPIEN platform at the upcoming TCT meeting. These include long-term PARTNER I data and quality of life data from PARTNER II. Although we anticipate an update on the CENTERA system, we expect a more robust dataset at EuroPCR in 2017.","In summary, based on our strong year-to-date results, we are reiterating our 2016 THV sales guidance of between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. We continue to expect our 2016 underlying sales growth to exceed 30% as momentum of global therapy adoption remains strong.","Turning to the Surgical Heart Valves, sales for the third quarter were $191 million and were flat compared to last year's results as mitral valve sales recovered and grew slightly while aortic valve sales declined modestly. Globally, our ASP was slightly higher due to product and regional mix. We have addressed the surgical mitral valve production matter that affected us last quarter. Globally, sales are recovering as inventories are being replenished.","In the third quarter, global surgical aortic valve sales were soft, which we believe was due to the impact of TAVR including a possible pent-up demand among U.S. intermediate risk patients and a slow over effect from the mitral shortage. This quarter, we received two approvals for our innovative surgical valve platforms designed for the future needs of patients requiring surgical interventions were not indicated for transcatheter therapy.","Our INTUITY Elite system was approved in the U.S. Clinician feedback from the initial implants has been positive, and we're positioning INTUITY Elite as a premium valve procedure and supporting it with the evidence of a strong value proposition.","We also recently received the CE Mark for our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve. The first in a new class of resilient heart valve that we expect to become our leading surgical valve platform globally. We're planning an initial introduction of INSPIRIS in Europe during the fourth quarter with the full launch expected in 2017.","In summary, given our year-to-date results, we continue to expect 2016 underlying sales growth for the full year to be between 0% and 2%. Although, we believe we're beginning to see the impact of TAVR, we expect our new product launches will lift our growth in 2017.","In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $138 million and grew 3% on an underlying basis. Our results were driven primarily by double-digit growth of our Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program across most regions. As expected, growth was lower this quarter due to prior-year comparisons.","As we announced previously during the quarter, we received CE Mark for a key new technology. The Acumen HPI software suite with our new flow track IQ smart disposable. This system provides the first of its kind hypotension or low blood pressure probability indicator during hemodynamic monitoring. Both are planned for targeted commercial release in Europe this year with a full launch in 2017. Based on our year-to-date results, we are maintaining our Critical Care underlying sales growth expectation to be between 5% and 7% for 2016.","In our structural heart initiatives, we continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and our CardiAQ-Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform. In our CardiAQ mitral valve replacement program, we are focused primarily on system enhancements and gaining clinical experience. Our clinical investigators believe that a less invasive transseptal approach will be preferred for treating patients suffering from mitral regurgitation and heart failure. During the third quarter, our investigators began treating patients with our improved transseptal delivery systems in our U.S. early feasibility study.","Our CE Mark trial is expected to begin soon. This trial, called the RELIEF trial, has been delayed due to more challenging regulatory processes than were anticipated for our most recent submission. As we indicated last quarter, the RELIEF trial is expected to include approximately 15 centers in Europe and Canada and will include transapical and transseptal delivery systems consistent with the desires of our clinicians. This single arm study will include patients suffering from functional and degenerative mitral regurgitation, and we expect clinical program updates will be shared at scientific meetings in 2017.","In our FORMA program, we have begun our CE Mark trial, the SPACER trial to evaluate this technology in patients with clinically significant symptomatic tricuspid valve regurgitation who were at high risk for surgery. The former device is a spacer placed within the native tricuspid valve, designed to improve valve performance and patient symptoms. The primary safety endpoint is 30 days with longer term follow-up. We are also engaged in a U.S. early feasibility study, and expect a presentation at TCT next week on our compassionate use experience.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thanks, Mike. Another strong performance in transcatheter valve sales drove significant top line and bottom line growth this quarter versus the prior year.","Our results were consistent with our guidance, which we raised three times this year as we delivered underlying sales growth of 18%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 26%, reflecting significant leverage during the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.68 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.65, which includes our customary adjustments for intellectual property litigation expenses and amortization of intangibles. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.","For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 72.8% compared to 76.2% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven predominantly by the same foreign exchange factors that negatively impacted our gross margins in the first half of 2016. We expect this to continue through the fourth quarter, and our full-year 2016 gross profit margin guidance remains unchanged at 73% to 74%, excluding special items. We expect gross margins to strengthen in 2017, as product mix improvement continues. And we'll discuss those expectations at our Investor Conference in December.","Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses, third quarter expenses increased 8% over the prior year to $230 million or 31.1% of sales. This increase was driven by sales and personnel related expenses, primarily in Transcatheter Heart Valves, partially offset by the suspension of the medical device excise tax. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year. We have increased investments in structural heart initiatives with the benefit of this year's medical device excise tax suspension.","R&D investments in the quarter increased 12% over the prior year to $113 million or 15.3% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our aortic and mitral transcatheter valve programs. We expect our R&D investments, excluding special items, to be between 15% and 16% of sales in the fourth quarter.","Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, up from 21.6% in the prior-year period. This increase was driven by improved results in the U.S., our region with the highest tax rate. We continue to expect our full-year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 22% and 23%.","Starting in 2017, our tax rate will reflect the new accounting standard for employee stock option exercises. It is difficult to predict the impact given the uncertainty of these exercises and our stock price. Rather than simply reflecting the expected benefit of this accounting change in 2017, our intention is to provide adjusted earnings per share guidance that excludes this impact, to facilitate transparent year-over-year comparisons.","Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter sales by $8 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our July guidance, FX rates favorably impacted EPS by $0.01 in the third quarter. Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $158 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $206 million, less capital investments of $48 million.","Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.2 billion; total debt was approximately $600 million. Average shares outstanding during the quarter were 218 million, which is consistent with our assumption for the fourth quarter and full year.","Now, turning to our 2016 guidance. For 2016, we are reiterating all of our full year sales guidance ranges. For Transcatheter Heart Valves, we continue to expect sales of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. For Surgical Heart Valves, we expect sales of $780 million to $820 million; and for Critical Care, we expect sales of $540 million to $580 million.","For total Edwards, we continue to expect sales at the high-end of our $2.7 billion to $3 billion range. Given our strong performance in the third quarter, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.82 and $2.92. And we continue to expect free cash flow, excluding special items, to be between $500 million and $600 million. For the fourth quarter 2016, at current foreign exchange rates, we project sales to be between $750 million and $790 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.67 and $0.77.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thanks, Scott. We are very pleased with our strong year-to-date financial performance. As patients and clinicians increasingly prefer TAVR, we remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity. We are committed to aggressively investing in our future, consistent with our focused innovation strategy, and we are confident that these investments will result in innovative therapies that will enable us to treat a broader group of patients and drive continued strong organic growth.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David K. Erickson - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thank you, Mike. Before we open it up for questions I'd like to remind you to mark your calendars for Thursday, December 8, when we will be hosting our 2016 Investor Conference in New York. This event will include updates on our latest technologies as well as our outlook for 2017. More information will be available in the coming weeks on our website.","In order to allow broad participation in our Q&A, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue, and we'll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the hour.","Operator, we're ready for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. And thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start, Mike, with the U.S. and the intermediate risk indication. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing since the approval in August, even though you had very strong growth this quarter, I think people will look at the deceleration in the U.S. TAVR growth in Q3 versus Q2. We had heard at the Cleveland Clinic that maybe there was some confusion about the reimbursement, whether it was already in place for intermediate risk. So, any update you can give us there would be helpful. And I do have a follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. Yeah. Happy to take the question, Larry. Yeah. We're pleased with the sales performance in the quarter, and 2016 in general. Pretty much the approval came as we expected in terms of the approval timing and in terms of what we thought our sales will be, actually the U.S. probably came in just slightly stronger than what we anticipated. So, it's pretty consistent with our expectation. Remember, we have a growth rate that I think was 55% in the quarter compared to something that was in the 60%s last quarter. So, not a lot of difference there. And I don't know that you should read too much into that.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's helpful. And then, you grew, again I think about 21% in the second quarter, 18% underlying in the third quarter. But I think the Q4 guidance is about 13% to 19% growth. So, what would get you to the high end versus the low end there? Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Are you talking about what fourth quarter might be globally for Edwards?","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. The guidance implies, I think, about 13% to 19%. So, just trying to understand kind of what gets you to the low end versus the high end there?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. I think our guidance tried to speak for itself. We had felt going into this quarter that we were going to end the year toward the high end of that range, that put us close to $3 billion and we continue to feel that way. So, and given that this quarter was pretty consistent with what we expected, we think the fourth quarter will also go that way. I don't know what other color to offer, Larry, but we feel pretty good about the way things are going. The situation in France was one that was unexpected. We didn't expect it to hit us in the third quarter. So that was a little bit of a curve ball, but not much else is off track.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions. Mike, I know that it sounds like the OUS performance, maybe ex-France, was in line with your expectations, but you're the victim of your own success, unfortunately. The company has beaten your own expectations and Street expectations on revenues nine straight quarters and earnings 13 straight. So that's why you've got some consternation on the phone tonight.","So, Mike, when you look at the market and the dynamics in particularly with intermediate risk coming in the quarter here in the U.S. and then later in the quarter in Europe, anything changed your thoughts on the trajectory of the business or any reason why you think there was some slowdown sequentially versus what we've seen in the prior few quarters?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","No. I really don't have a reason to talk about a sequential slowdown, Michael. I mean, as you know, the numbers are getting larger every quarter. So, there's something to consider there. But when we go to the big picture, we continue to think we're early on in the TAVR adoption cycle. We expect this to be more than $5 billion in 2021 and to grow quite a bit beyond that. I wouldn't read too much into any particular quarter, we're very pleased to get this intermediate risk; it came pretty consistent with what we thought. The labeling is quite consistent with what we thought, and it's just going to take a little time for people to change their practice. I don't think anybody \u2013 if they are anticipating a step function then they must not be following exactly the way this has grown. Generally, it's been more of a gradual ramp for us.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Let me ask you just one question on the CardiAQ program if I can. It sounds like you are expecting to be proud (23:33). If we look forward to 2017, do you think that you'll be in a position given you just started the U.S. feasibility and a release study is just about to get underway that you would have some 30-day data at PCR, or do you think we're probably waiting until TCT to see that?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. I hate to project when we're going to have results, Michael. I mean, you know this is a high priority program. We're very pleased to be enrolling patients with a transseptal delivery system in the U.S. and actually our clinicians and candidates in Europe are looking forward to that as well. But we'll try and give you a little bit more guidance at the Investor Conference in terms of what to expect in 2017.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That would be great. Thanks, Mike, for taking the question.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Please proceed.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. So, one question. Just looking at the, call it, deceleration, but, I guess, lower year-over-year growth in the third quarter versus the second quarter. That does not all that dissimilar to what we saw last summer, and in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.","And then I'm just wondering if you could speak to any color on \u2013 is there a seasonal pattern here we should pay attention to that to play? Is there a transition to centers that are ramping up in advanced and intermediate indication that that is a factor here we should be mindful of putting aside how great this opportunity is over the long term? And then I have one follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure, Matt. Yeah, a couple of things. One is that yes, we always see a seasonal impact. So, it's not unusual for us to be slow in July and August and for that to strengthen in September, and that's indeed the way the third quarter went. If we start looking around the country, we saw both large and small hospitals grow. Remember what we said about the continued access, switching off so you had the 50 \u2013 which in many cases were the largest centers that flipped over from doing clinical cases to doing commercial cases. So you should keep that in mind. And so that's probably the bigger picture. I don't know, if you're looking at global numbers, I think it's worth noting that France impacted us negatively. We've entered around $5 million in the quarter so that may help with some of that as well.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Sure. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on CENTERA, you mentioned some data year at TCT, but then more meaningful data next year. You can maybe given how successful, how well the clinical data has progressed for SAPIEN 3, maybe flesh out what's the role remind us again of where this fits in, in the arm inventory and how you see it playing a role in your product line up as we get closer to that time in the market?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised if there's some kind of data that gets presented at TCT, but I'm not sure the nature of it. What we thought is that actually the CE Mark trial is likely to be presented at PCR. So that was what we were referring to about 2017.","Over the long-term, our commercial strategy will be more clearly defined as we actually see that data ourselves. But the way we've looked at it going into it, there's been a number of users, it's in the minority, but a number of users that have preferred a self-expanding system and we think CENTERA is a pretty outstanding self-expanding system. So that's been our rationale up to now, but what will be most important to us is to see what that clinical data looks like.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you, Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, as we called around in Europe, we heard of a large price differential with you guys maintaining price in a very disciplined manner. How much of a market share impact this is playing, and do you feel that you too play along with it given the excellence of your data? And I have a follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Okay, I'm sorry. I don't know if (28:20). All right. There seems like there is a little bit noise on the line, hopefully you could hear me okay.","Yeah, indeed, we do operate with a price premium. In many cases, it might be as much as 20%. And it's possible that we lose some market share result of that. You're right, we have every intention of maintaining our discipline, it's difficult to quantify exactly how that works. We're convinced that we could maintain a strong leadership position by doing that because of the high level of differentiation there is with the SAPIEN 3 valve. It just performs at an extremely high level. And so we expect to continue to do that.","And again, when you're thinking about market shares, we noted that Europe grew at 20% this quarter and we grew less than that. Remember the impact of the situation in France as part of that, a big part of it.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. And my follow-up pertains to mitral. How is it feeling to you? Do you see commercialization on the not-too-distant horizon or do you really feel that there's a lot of fundamental work left to be done?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thanks, Bruce. We've got just a lot to learn at this point. We're very pleased to be engaged in doing cases, it's the single most important thing we can do. We're glad to be engaged with the U.S. right now, and we're going to be ramping up here pretty good in Canada, in Europe as well. That's going to be very meaningful to us. We've cautioned you please not to include any kind of revenue expectation in 2017. And I hesitate to say much more than that, Bruce. You can tell we're enthusiastic. We wouldn't be beginning a CE Mark trial if we weren't enthusiastic about this, but there is a lot to be proven. And the only way for us to really know the answer is to have some good experience.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks so much, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, Mike. Can you hear me okay?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah, I hear you great. Are we coming through okay, Jason?","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","You are. Just occasionally you hear some echo, but I'll just go ahead and let me know if you need me to repeat it. Just wanted to stay on the topic of international transcatheter valves. You highlighted Japan, Mike. And that's been burgeoning market for a while. I'm wondering if you could segment it a bit for us, since the price you're willing to give to quantify. Just how bigger market Japan is and how much is the growth that you saw in the market, saw 20%. How much of that is coming from Japan?","And structurally, if there's anything in Japan that's changed over the last several months to make it a more to sort of tappable market, if you will?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Jason. Yeah. Early on, I think, we projected that Japan was likely to be a market in the $300 million to $400 million range. We'll have to refine that. As we noted it got started a little slower than we thought. They created some structural barriers including a different approval process for a site to start. And we thought the slowed us down. But like many things in Japan, although they might start slowly as they start adopting the therapy, it starts catching on. We think it's likely to be, maybe just under $100 million opportunity in 2016, but the SAPIEN 3 launch is probably one of the stimulus to growth in Japan and we're experiencing that right now.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Got it. So, did your European business ex-France, did it have growth in the quarter in TAVI?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Oh, yeah. No, it probably grew at low double digits, but it grew. It just didn't grow as fast as the market. And the biggest impact was, what happened in France.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","That's helpful. As a follow-up in the United States, I think it was asked earlier, I didn't hear a response. Just to the reimbursement landscape for TAVR and specifically intermediate risk, obviously, the guidelines accommodate reimbursement for evidence, development and intermediate risk obviously has that evidence now. Is there any indication to you that anybody anywhere in the country is having an issue with respect to reimbursement for intermediate risk patients or categorizing the intermediate risk patients? Is that at all having any impact on the penetration of that segment? Thanks, Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Jason. We're going to need to let others ask","some questions too. I can't tell you that I'm aware of anybody that is having a particular reimbursement problem. I mean, we have situations around the country where customers will push back on price if that happens, but we have a lot of confidence in the fact that TAVR delivers great value to all the stakeholders. And so, I wouldn't call it an obstacle.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Thanks. Can you hear me?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yes, Brooks.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, great. Mike, I just want to make sure I have the mechanics of the intermediate U.S. risk launch correct. I know you got the indication mid-August, and you brought the guys in out of the field for some training. So, I'm assuming by kind of early September you were out detailing accounts. Can you talk about \u2013 did I hear you correctly in saying that it was just the IDE sites that were doing intermediate risk patients in September? And how has that progressed or was it literally like a light switch going on, and everybody was doing intermediate cases right out of the gates?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","No, it was \u2013 it's closer to being the light switch if you will, Brooks. So, yeah, we got the approval. We had our team already trained. Remember, this was just a label change. So, people already had the valves on their shelf. When I was talking about the IDE sites what I was trying to indicate is, they were already treating their intermediate risk patients through the Continued Access Protocol.","And so those sites flipped over from treating them within this clinical protocol into commercial sales, so not a big change in practice for them. And for the others, there was some that our team helped them out with some coding. But again, you need to think about what broadly happens in medicine. This is a referral process, and it takes a while for the referral process to really get rewired. So, I don't think anybody should expect that there's sort of a step function that went along with this approval.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Great. That's all I had. Thanks, Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. So, Scott and Mike, I wanted to come back to your guidance for TAVR of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. I guess, I think, we're all familiar with tonight \u2013 the debate is that the business didn't grow. There \u2013 the U.S. TAVR business double digits, but the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion guidance doesn't really answer that that debate for shareholders. So, Scott, I was sort of wondering, maybe you can help us understand the construction of guidance because the debate really centers on whether you do sort of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion. So, is it a safe assumption if you felt that $1.7 billion, the top on your guidance, was not achievable by the fourth quarter, you would have revised that guidance? Help us understand how you were thinking about the construction of not changing the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So, keep in mind, our philosophy on guidance is to aim for the midpoint. And that's what we do for our business units and for the company in total. I think that we achieved our guidance this quarter for the first time in quite a while, and it reflects the fact that we've got three guidance increases during the course of the year. We intentionally have not increased guidance for any of the business units or consolidated going into Q4. It's still growing very rapidly. I mean, the company grew 20% in the first quarter, 21% in the second quarter, 18% in the third quarter. We've got TAVR growing in the U.S. at 55% compared to 60-some percent in Q2 and Q1. So, we still feel really good about the growth. We still feel good about the market expansion opportunity, but, no, we're not expecting any different range than what we've already talked about for TAVR or for the company.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Scott, obviously at $1.6 billion \u2013 sorry to push you here \u2013 $1.6 billion obviously is a deceleration frankly in the U.S. market. And $1.7 billion in \u2013 and we're all realizing that we're spending too much time thinking about the growth deceleration because obviously the business is back on track and that's why I'm pushing you here. So, your view that $1.6 billion is still sort of the right way of thinking about it, still holds even though we're really heading into the fourth quarter of the year?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. If you just do the year-to-date results and extrapolate a reasonable growth rate assumption, then sure, the midpoint of that range is a good assumption going into the fourth quarter and probably a little bit above that. It's tough to get a perfect bead on, because we've got a business in the U.S. that's growing 55%, 60% range year-to-date, it's tough to have a lot of precision, but I think aiming for the mid-part of the range is a much better assumption than aiming for $1.7 billion.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Mike, just real quickly a clinical question for you. On TCT, embolic protection, something you've talked about several years ago, but in the last couple of years you have talked less about as, frankly, clinical endpoints have gotten dramatically better for TAVR procedures. If we see successful embolic protection data next week at TCT, does that matter to you or your business and change your strategic direction, or you still just focused on making the TAVR procedure better without embolic protection? Thanks so much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, David. You know what, we've got such robust data \u2013 you got to think of what we've been through. We've been through the PARTNER I, and now the PARTNER II data. And the PARTNER II data with SAPIEN 3 suggested there was a 1% stroke rate. And this was heavily adjudicated, and remember, a neurological assessment before during and after TAVR. So, hard to imagine that this isn't really high quality evidence.","So, it's going to be tough for us to anticipate that anything that could be presented that's going to suggest \u2013 we would have to argue that, we're going to take it less than 1%. So, if that \u2013 if there was some argument, and there was that sound of data that would be interesting, but it's a pretty high hurdle for us to believe that that's an important part of future therapy.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill lynch","Thanks, and good afternoon.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Hey, Bob.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill lynch","So, hey. So, just a couple of really quick ones. A lot of the key questions have been asked. Scott, maybe a quick question for you. Looking forward to the Analyst Day here in a little bit, and I know you're not going to give any thoughts on 2017 any sort of concrete way today, but consensus is at about 12% revenue growth for 2017 and about 19% earnings growth for 2017. Maybe at a minimum, could you just to help us think through some of the important puts and takes that we should be considering and if you think people aren't considering things, please point that out? Just sort of any preliminary thoughts on major puts and takes as we think about modeling for next year?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. So, you're right. It's pretty mature to give you a specific underlying growth rate expectations for the top line, but maybe I can take you through the P&L. For gross profit margin, this year's guidance was 73% to 74%. I think we'll get a little bit of a lift from that in 2017. Keep in mind, we're still going to be investing in growing capacity and investing in our operations, but we should get a little bit of lift in our gross margin.","For SG&A, we continue to drive expenses down. Our guidance for the year was 30% to 32%, this quarter we came in at 31%. I think it's reasonable that we can continue to improve on SG&A. Again, it's going to be a slower improvement curve than what we achieved over the last 18 months from the high 30%s to the low 30%s, but we're going to keep working on trying to drive efficiency in the back office and overhead expenses.","On R&D, this year's R&D as a percentage of sales rate is probably a good assumption because if you think about ramping up the low risk trial for TAVR and the investments we're making in our transcatheter mitral valve and other programs that's probably a good indicator of where the spend should come in, in 2017.","The other big one is just the tax rate. And we're still puzzling what the tax rate forecast should look like. There's been upward pressure to the tune of 200 basis points this quarter. We're doing a lot of things internally to try to mitigate that upward pressure, but as we continue to grow in the U.S., that's something we're going to continue to fight. So, I hope that gives you some of the pushes and takes, and we'll get more into the details in December.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill lynch","Okay. That's very helpful. And then one really quick follow-up. So, first, Scott, do you think people are missing anything significantly that's worth calling out on the top line? And then just real quickly on mitral. Mike, do we still expect that the CE Mark trial to start this year or could that pushing to early next? Thank you very much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","No. We think we're pretty close here. We think it's going to start very soon.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","And on the top line, I think this is pretty reflective of the strength of the business. And so, yeah, we may be victims of our own success in terms of coming in almost exactly where we had expected, but we're still really pleased with our top line performance. At the beginning of the year, we thought consolidated top line underlying growth was going to be something like 7% to 11%, now we're running at 18% this quarter, 20% range in Q2 and Q1. We originally thought TAVR was going to be 10% to 18%, now we're running 37% in the third quarter. So, there is a lot of tailwind to our growth rates, and especially after increasing our guidance $300 million on the year, we're feeling really good about executing on pretty high bar.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Mike, I just had a question on Europe and the competitive landscape. I think on past calls, you said that beyond you and Medtronic, the smaller players had about 10% to 15% European market share. Is that the case? Has anything changed, because when I look at Europe, when I take out France, Europe still came in a little bit light. So I was wondering if some of that could be just the competitive dynamics. Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. Yeah. I think there was a little bit of share loss beyond France. So that's fair in Europe. But it doesn't look like it came much from the smaller competitors. I think in the last quarter we said the smaller competitors were around 15%, and it still seems that they're pretty close to that. There may be a little bit of movement amongst them, but if anything, we might have lost a little bit of share to Medtronic this quarter.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just as a follow-up to surgical valves now. You made the comments in your prepared remarks that you thought intermediate was starting to slow down the U.S. surgical market. So, how should we think about this market going forward? Should we start modeling, this is kind of a flat to down market overall and I think you said that you thought you could actually grow your surgical valves next year. So, a flat to down market with average may be taking shares, and how we should be thinking about it over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. We're looking at that very carefully. And the big SAPEIN 3 data that was presented at the ACC probably caused us and everybody else to think about this a little bit differently. So, we're watching it very closely. I think it's logical to assume what you said, which is that the conversion to TAVR is likely to slow that down and maybe to be a zero something in that range in the U.S., a zero growth rate. What we're pleased that we've got a number of innovations in the surgical valve space that are going to be exciting that we think is going to drive our own growth and help us with that headwind.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Please proceed.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. Mike, you mentioned as we think about the intermediate risk indication, it's not necessarily a light switch, part of that's the referral network. The sense I get from talking to folks as well as centers having to build capacity, and so I'm wondering how much of either of those are you seeing as the gating factor in the intermediate risk indication? And if there is a point at which we do see an inflection point, once the capacity comes on line and once the referral network starts really moving?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thanks, Danielle. You can imagine it's difficult to know in any exact sense on those points that you measure. But if you were to ask our team, they would say that they don't believe that hospital capacity is a big issue. They would say that they've been impressed with the site's ability to add cases and add capacity, particularly with SAPIEN 3 than more what they'll refer to is the referral network has to change. And so minds have to change. The minds of surgeons and remember, you've got many hospitals out there that are not TAVR centers right now. So, you've got a fair amount of that change that needs to be implemented and that's part of what drives the curve.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. And just one quick question about France. Have you provided us with what the annual run rate last year was for France, just to get a sense of. I know you said it was $5 million to this quarter, but just as we think about going forward, what's the...?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. We have not done that. I don't have that handy. It is our second largest country in Europe and it has been growing quite fast. It's actually more recently been growing faster than rest of Europe. So, it's significant. And so, we're glad to be working toward a solution in France because that's important to patients there.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","And I assume you are a market share leader in France as well, so you're disproportionately affected.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. A matter of fact, in 2016, there are only two companies that are approved in France, Edwards and Medtronic. And we're a clear leader.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Scott, maybe just talk a little bit about the 2017 gross margin. I think we've talked in the past about a new manufacturing facility coming online in Costa Rica over the first part of the year. So, might we think of that cadence of gross margin improvement being more back half weighted just for modeling purposes?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Probably not a whole lot of benefit from Costa Rica coming online in 2017. Our plan is that we're going to start production on a limited basis towards the back half of the year, but it's really not going to start moving the needle on gross profit margin. In fact, we're going to continue to be investing to help support that development. We are going to get mixed improvement though in 2017. This quarter we got probably 200 basis points of mixed improvement in our gross profit margin. I'm not sure we're going to be able to accomplish that much in 2017, but I think you're going to have this lift that I mentioned earlier coming from some mixed improvement offset by that continuing investment in operations.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then a totally unrelated follow-up, I apologize. But might we see any valve durability data coming up at your TCT or near-term or are there kind of discussion of next steps on that front? Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. This is Mike. Thanks, Ben. I don't know what's going to be out there. I'm not aware of any substantial valve data. We haven't heard it be a big issue in the marketplace. I think there're some late breaking data that's echo-related from PARTNER I. And so, there may be something there that's helpful. When you actually see the five-year data from PARTNER I, I think that could be helpful, but I don't know that there's going to be much incremental beyond that.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Can you hear me okay?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. I can hear you fine, Joanne.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Wonderful. Thank you for taking the question. It's approximately two-parts and completely unrelated. The first part is, use of cash with $1.1 billion sitting on the balance sheet. How should we think about you deploying this one? And then, my second question has to do with when we would talk with physicians, we hear about adding rooms, adding days, adding lots of capacity. Are we anywhere near worrying about capacity constraints in the U.S. yet? Thank you.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. Why don't I take the cash piece, Mike, and you take the second piece? On use of cash, our priorities have not changed at all. Our first priority is still to make sure we're investing in high return important long-term growth therapies. And in terms of free cash flow, we fund episodic acquisitions. They're going to continue to be likely not great big acquisitions. Historically, they're smaller investments, minority investments, options to buy companies, funding, start up, joint venture types of companies, but we will continue to be investing in external growth.","During the course, we've been active repurchaser of our shares and we're going to continue to do that on an opportunistic basis to at least offset the dilutive effects of incentive compensation, and we'd like to continue to reduce the share count as well, which we've done here over the last several years.","One of the big issues we're dealing with is, we got $1.2 billion in cash, but a lot of it is stranded outside of the U.S. And so that's cash that's not available for share repurchase and that something that we're going to continue to work on in terms of how we structure our assets and where we realize profits and cash around the world.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","And, Joanne, your question about capacity then, are we concerned. We're not concerned about it. What we have primarily seen is people adding cases to the day that they already do TAVR, just because the SAPIEN 3 cases go faster, they're so much more efficient, they're so much more a problem free. People find that they can do more cases in the same day without making a significant investment. There are, of course, people that are adding days, there're some people that are adding capacity, but we think those are secondary to people adding cases in a day.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening. Thanks, gentlemen. I was hoping that just ask in post and intermediate approval, we've gotten some feedback from clinicians about kind of segmenting the intermediate risk population between the PARTNER IIA and STS scores that are in the higher end and in older patients 75 and above versus lower STS scores in the 3% to 4% range in a 70 or younger age range. I know it's still very early days, but are you seeing any differential penetration rates in those two segments within the intermediate risk and how do you see that evolving in terms of your ability to penetrate that, I guess, lower end of the intermediate risk range?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Josh. Yeah. It's a little tough. I know, when you go out there and talk to customers, sometime you can find people with their own points of view. And so, they'll always be subject to that. We fall back on the PARTNER II trial. It was a big trial. It was robust, and I think it told heart teams a lot about the practice.","I think more or less it has not differentiated and said that you should split this group of patients. It was very clear. It said that intermediate patients did better with SAPIEN 3 than they did with surgery, and we certainly know what the patient preference would be. So, we think it's clear. It's just going to take some people time to work through their own thoughts and biases. You remember that surgeons broadly feel that they do a great job with these patients. And so, they don't believe that the procedures are very dangerous and so forth. And so, this is just part of the process of medicine going through change.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for that. And just a follow-up on low-risk trial enrollment. We've just gotten some feedback from a couple of centers that it's a little bit slower than they anticipated as low-risk patients are trying to circumnavigate randomization of surgery. I don't know if that's broad based, but if you had any thoughts on that. And just lastly, good luck with the Cubs tonight.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Well, thanks very much, Josh. Yeah, we got off to a little bit of a slow start, because contracting in this startup phase of the trial did go a little longer than we thought. These were new contracts with each of these sites. Enrollments underway. We've got about 50 sites that are engaged. And although it maybe started a little slow, it seems like it's picked up. We have not changed our guidance. We're continuing to believe that it's mid next year. But again, we're watching that closely and we'll update you at the Investor Conference as we get a chance to get a little bit more experience. And thank you about the comments for Cubs.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking the question.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Hi, Kristen.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Mike. Just wanted to go back to the question that Glenn had asked. In the beginning, I thought you had said the aortic valves were down globally. And I think Glenn had it said in the U.S. I just wanted to see what the difference was with aortic valves in the U.S. versus globally. And just clarify your thoughts, I guess, on that measure after you answer.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So, you were talking about surgical aortic valves, not transcatheter valves, right, Kristen?","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Correct.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Okay. Yeah. They were slightly negative in the U.S. They also were a little negative globally.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, I guess, I'm just a little surprised given that this quarter you'd just got the intermediate risk. How do you think that that suggests, I guess, that they're now negative in the U.S. so soon? Does that then suggest that there might have been some penetration into the intermediate already, or do you think that this is just more of a digesting process or how should we interpret that so soon?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. We're trying to sort it out right now. I tried to address this in our comments, and maybe it wasn't really clear, Kristen. We believe that there is a TAVR effect of some sort. There also \u2013 or at least some sites where they inferred that there may have been some pent-up demand amongst intermediate risk patients. In addition to that, we thought that there may have been some spillover effect from the mitrals. And so, you can picture a patient that would need a double valve replacement \u2013 an aortic and a mitral valve. Often a surgeon will choose to make those be the same valve type. So, those things all may have added influence and we only have about a month's worth of experience. So tough for us to deduce anything big picture; tough for us to deduce anything big picture; we'll keep you filled in as we learn a little bit more, but there does seem to be something that happened in this quarter compared to what we've seen in the past, and we'll watch it closely and keep you tuned in.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I guess, was it consistent across the quarter?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","No. No, it really wasn't, but then again the quarter is always a little bit odd, Kristen, because we always have sort of a softer July and August in both our surgical business and our TAVR business, and it picks up in September. So, it's tough to tell is this normal seasonality or is it somehow related to the approval; it's just too soon to tell.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just from a reimbursement standpoint, in talking with hospitals, I know you said that it wasn't really an issue, but have you talked to hospitals just about the reimbursement for surgical valves versus TAVR, just because surgical valves, I know, are very, very profitable from a hospital perspective?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","I think that's right, Kristen. Broadly, I think, if you were to generalize, you'd say that surgical valve replacement is a very profitable procedure. In many cases, it's more profitable than TAVR. But having said that, heart teams are tending to do what they think is right for the patient. Plus at this point, an efficient TAVR program does make money, and when it's a growth program on top of it, it's one that hospitals are incentivized to build.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And go Cubs.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Please proceed.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I had a clarification question; when you talked about (58:52) a longer term resolution, can you characterize what that might be, and I guess, what it would mean for your opportunity there? And are there any other OUS (59:02) limitations?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. One of (59:09) these new innovations is, reimbursement does end up stimulating demand, because without reimbursement it's just not as robust. So the French has a particular system in which they provide reimbursement before DRG goes in place, and they've employed that on TAVR. And they sort of anticipate the number of procedures each year and have designed their system around that. What happened is, TAVR grew so fast in 2016, it grew beyond their number. And that's what created the situation.","We're in pretty deep conversations with them trying to help them understand the situation and the need of their patients. And so, I think we're hopeful that we have a resolution for 2016 that's pretty robust and we've engaged in conversations about 2017 and beyond. So, it's productive. We're hopeful, but again, we'll keep you tuned in if there's new developments. But, we're hopeful that we're going to be heading back toward normal.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Any other places where there might be limitations like that or where you have to get in front of regulators about the quotas?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Okay. Yeah. And we're going to have to end questions here pretty soon guys. But, yeah so, it's not unusual for us to have these situations. You know that countries that have really good reimbursement tend to have heavier penetration rate. And I think we've shown you some of the countries in Europe in the past where reimbursement is in place and well known, there is a higher penetration rate. Maybe that's something that we can highlight it on our Investor Conference and to sort of lay that out for you in terms of where reimbursement exists and where it doesn't. But generally that's evolving as the therapy becomes prudent proven. So, generally our dossiers are so strong on TAVR and its value proposition that that situation is improving over time.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please proceed.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. And thanks for squeezing me in here. Mike, you guys have highlighted a number of times how strong the first half year was, and how much full year expectations rose as a result compared to what you're originally expecting. Now we had 3Q results that were very good on an absolute basis, but really didn't reflect a big new indication coming online the way investors may have been expecting. So, how confident are you that the unexpected first half strength didn't include some pulling forward of demand within that intermediate risk cohort and that's why the inflection wasn't as sharp this quarter.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. I suppose anything is possible, Chris. I like to think that one of the big inflection points was the PARTNER II data that was presented in April. And so, we didn't really see a big difference between Q1 and Q2, so it's difficult to tell. We never expect that a step function. We always expected a gradual increase. And although we've done, I think, a reasonably good job of projecting the TAVR opportunity in the long-term. It has been a challenge for us to predict actual quarters. Actually, we probably have done a better job predicting this quarter than we have over the recent past, but I don't have much more explanation than that.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over Mr. David Erickson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Erickson. You may now begin.","David Erickson","Welcome and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our first quarter 2016 financial results. During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use remaining time for Q&A.

These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and current expectations for clinical, regulatory, and commercial matters, as well as therapy trends and foreign currency movements.

Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in our press release, our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our other SEC filings, all of which are available on our website at edwards.com.","Also, as a quick reminder, that when we use the terms underlying, adjusted, and excluding special items, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release and our website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael Mussallem","Thank you, David. Say pardon the sketchiness of my voice. I'm just getting over a cold, but if my voice gives out, I'll ask for Scott to help me out. So let\u2019s jump into it. We are very pleased to report a strong start to 2016 with first quarter sales of $697 million, representing an underlying growth rate of 20%. Significant Transcatheter Heart Valves sales once again drove the majority of this quarter's growth, with solid performance in our core businesses, in particular Critical Care.","We are also pleased to report strong bottom-line results while aggressively investing in new therapies that can have meaningful future impact. And most importantly, even more patients are benefiting from our life-saving therapies than ever before. In Transcatheter Heart Valves, global underlying sales were $366 million, up 38% over the prior year. Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption in the U.S., globally, average selling prices remain stable.","In the U.S., underlying THV sales for the quarter were $215 million and grew 64% versus the prior year. Our performance was driven primarily by procedure growth with continue - which continue to exceed our expectations. We saw this growth across both large and small TAVR sites and it was fueled by the recent U.S. launch of SAPIEN 3. We estimate modest share gain also contributed to our results.","Following the end of the quarter, at the American College of Cardiology meeting, data from intermediate risk cohorts of two clinical studies were presented. The large randomized PARTNER II trial, which compared to SAPIEN XT Valve to surgery, met its primary endpoint to two years and demonstrated non-inferiority when compared to surgery.","The second trial showed that SAPIEN 3 TAVR demonstrated clinical superiority to surgery at one-year on a composite endpoint, and also on individual assessments of all cause mortality and stroke. We are very proud of these robust data and believe they provide powerful evidence in favor of expanding the SAPIEN 3 technology to a broader population of patients with aortic stenosis.","We remain on track to submit the final intermediate risk data sets to the FDA in the next couple of weeks. Based on the strength of these data, it\u2019s possible for the approval for the approval to come earlier than expected, although it's difficult to predict regulatory timelines. We are now modeling an approval and launch at the beginning of the fourth quarter.","As a reminder, intermediate risk patients continue to be treated with our continued access protocol of the PARTNER II trial, which has been tracking at about $10 million in sales per quarter. This would end as commercial sales begin. Enrollment in our PARTNER III trial began recently. This randomize trial will study SAPIEN 3 in more than 1200 low-risk and enrollment is expected to continue in 2017.","We are pleased to receive a Pulmonic indication for SAPIEN XT this quarter. This will allow for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients in the U.S. who suffer from either a narrowed pulmonary valve or regurgitation caused by congenital heart disease.","Outside the U.S., underlying THV sales grew 13% driven by ongoing therapy adoption in Europe and Japan. Also our SAPIEN 3 value was approved in the first quarter in Japan and we are currently in the process of training sites on this best-in-class value and preparation for rollout beginning next month.","In Europe, we estimate the procedures continue to grow more than 20% in the first quarter compared to last year. We saw a strong growth across most countries and total procedures are becoming more disbursed throughout the region, with other countries growing faster than Germany.","Edwards grew at a slower rate, and we estimate our market share decrease as competitors continue to broaden their product offerings. While difficult to estimate, we believe that more recent competitive entrance collectively realized a significant year-over-year growth rate, but account for approximately 15% or so of total procedures.","As we previously mentioned, we plan to use our U.S. intermediate risk data to expand our CE Mark indication. These data will be submitted to European regulators in the next few weeks, with the expectation for approval of an expanded label in late 2016 or early 2017. Because some European countries have already been aggressive adopters of TAVR technology, overall, we expect the strong data reported at ACC to have a limited impact on European treatment rates until guidelines are updated, and where applicable, reimbursement is modified to cover the broader label.","Our SAPIEN 3 Ultra System is still on track for CE Mark in the fourth quarter of this year. This new system, featuring and on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, is expected to enhance ease-of-use, further reduce possible complications, and shorten procedure time.","In summary, we continue to believe that TAVR provides an important and compelling therapy option for a large number of untreated elderly patients. Based primarily on the continuing strong therapy adoption of TAVR, we are increasing our 2016 sales guidance by $100 million, to $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We now expect our underlying sales growth to exceed 25%.","Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group, sales for the first quarter were $196 billion, up slightly over last year on an underlying basis. Globally, sales were lifted by an increase in surgical heart valve units, which we believe was primarily driven by greater aortic disease awareness that prompted a larger number of surgical procedures. Our growth was offset by the ongoing exit of non-strategic cannula products.","Sales of our premium products contributed to solid heart valve performance across the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Worldwide surgical aortic units grew approximately 7% and global average selling prices saw a slight decline. In Japan, we recently launched our tricuspid surgical valve repair product and have seen strong interest in this therapy.","We\u2019ve been in discussion with the FDA regarding approval of our rapid deployment INTUITY Elite Valve and believe we remain on track for a mid-2016 launch in the U.S. Additionally in response to our application for a new technology add-on payment for INTUITY Elite, CMS has expressed concern that the technology may not meet certain eligibility criteria and our team is preparing a formal response.","In summary, we are pleased with the strength of our premium surgical heart valve products. We continue to invest in this area and believe that surgery will continue to have a vital role for patients, even as TAVR expands. We are reiterating our 2016 underlying sales growth expectation for the total product group of 3% to 6% as we expect stronger second-half growth from INTUITY Elite launch in the U.S. and a diminishing impact from the exit of non-strategic cannula products.","In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $134 million and grew 9% on an underlying basis. Overall growth for the quarter was strong in our core products and our enhanced surgical recovery program, which once again double-digit underlying sales growth across more \u2013 across most regions.","Our sales this quarter benefited from the announced discontinuation of our legacy monitor that lifted replacement monitor sales. Our recent investments in U.S. sales resources also stimulated stronger adoption of our market-leading products. Overall, we are pleased with the continued adoption of enhanced surgical recovery and the strengthening of our core products and we continue to expect Critical Care underlying sales growth of 2% to 4% in 2016.","Turning to our investments in structural heart initiatives, we continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and on our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform, or TMVR, which we expect to be the first of multiple generations.","In our early generation CardiAQ Edwards platform, we are already in the process of implementing several enhancements and we expect clinical updates to be presented later this year. Learnings from our experience in the U.S. early feasibility study now underway have informed our first CE Mark trial called the Relief trial, which is still on track to begin middle of this year.","We remain committed to developing this therapy and, although commercialization timelines are still unclear, we continue to believe that innovative structural heart therapies will ultimately benefit patients with mitral valve disease, who aren\u2019t well served today.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Ullem","Thanks, Mike. This quarter our underlying sales were $696 million and grew 20% on an underlying basis, which exceeded our expectations for two reasons. First, strong THV sales drove performance to the top end of our guidance range, and second, strengthening foreign currencies since last quarter's guidance, contributed over $10 million. Reported sales, including the effects of foreign-exchange and the sales return reserve grew 18%, to $697 million.","We have made strategic decisions about how to utilize savings from the two-year suspension of the medical device excise tax. The suspension provided us flexibility to reinvest in research and development, for example, by accelerating investments in structural heart initiatives. We also made a special $5 million contribution to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation, in support of the Every Heartbeat Matters initiative. This initiative is focused on addressing the global burden of heart valve disease in underserved people.","The $5 million contribution is reflected in the Other expense line of our income statement. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 25% versus prior-year to $0.71, primarily driven by our THV sales performance and reflects solid leverage. This growth was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign-exchange, increased research and development investments, and our charitable contribution.","I'll now cover the details behind our results, including guidance for the remainder of the year. For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 74.1%, compared to 77% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven primarily by the foreign-exchange impact from inventory sold internationally and higher spending in our global manufacturing operations, partially offset by a more profitable product mix.","To accommodate our increased sales demand going forward, we are investing in manufacturing capacity, which will negatively impact our gross profit margin for the remainder of 2016. Combined with a lower than expected benefit from FX contracts, we now expect our full-year gross profit rate, excluding special items, to be between 73% and 74%. First quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% over the prior year to $213 million or 30.5% of sales.","This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expenses related to transcatheter valves and personnel-related expenses. This was partially offset by the suspension of the medical device excise tax, as well as the favorable FX impact on our expenses outside the U.S. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full-year.","Research and development investments in the quarter increased 19% over the prior-year to $102 million or 14.7% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and aortic valve programs and a lower than normal spend in the prior-year quarter. The suspension of the medical device excise tax provided additional flexibility to accelerate investments in structural heart initiatives this quarter. We continue to expect our research and development investments, excluding special items, to be approximately 16% of sales for the full-year.","During the first quarter, we recorded $12.2 million in intellectual property-related expenses, which have been excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The expenses include the resolution of an IT matter and expenses related to ongoing litigation against Neovasc in the United States, and with Boston Scientific, where we now have multiple litigation matters in the U.S. and Europe.","Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 22%, down from 24.1% in the prior year period. This decrease was driven largely by our manufacturing sourcing strategy. We now expect our full-year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 22% and 23%.","Foreign-exchange rates decreased first quarter sales by $9 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, which have been volatile, we now estimate minimal impact to full-year 2016 sales, compared to the prior year. This is $55 million less than the impact we estimated last quarter. Compared to our February guidance, foreign-exchange rates had less than a $0.01 impact on earnings per share in the first quarter.","Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $79 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $107 million less capital spending of $28 million.","Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash and equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $950 million. Total debt was approximately $600 million. In February 2016, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements for $325 million. Upon entering into the agreements, we received and retired an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares.","As a result, average shares outstanding during the quarter declined to $218 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 of $216 million to $220 million.","Turning to our 2016 guidance. We now expect full-year sales to be between $2.7 billion and $3 billion, an increase from last quarter's guidance of more than $100 million at the midpoint of the range. This increase reflects an anticipated $55 million of improvements from foreign-exchange, as well as higher expectations for THV, as a result of strong momentum in the first quarter, the strength of the PARTNER II presented at ACC, and a planned earlier U.S. indication expansion for SAPIEN 3.","We now expect THV sales of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Our sales guidance for surgical heart valves in Critical Care remain unchanged. We continue to expect sales for surgical heart valves within the range of $780 million to $820 million and for Critical Care within the range of $510 million to $550 million. With today's increase in sales guidance, we now expect our adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.67, $2.77.","We expect the earnings per share drop through of today's sales guidance increase to be lower than last quarter's, due to a lower benefit from foreign-exchange contracts, increased performance-based compensation, and increased expenses associated with the expansion of manufacturing capacity.","For the second quarter of 2016 at current foreign-exchange we project sales to be between $700 million and $740 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.67 and $0.73. Finally for full-year 2016, given our expected improved operating performance. We now expect free cash flow excluding special items to be between $500 million and $600 million.","So with that I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael Mussallem","Thanks Scott. In conclusion, our strong start to 2016 positions us well for another successful year. We\u2019re enthusiastic about the continued expansion of transcatheter based therapies for the many structural heart patients still in need, and we are confident in our outlook for strong sales growth and we remain passionate about developing impactful therapies to help more patients around the world.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David Erickson","Thank you, Mike. In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions please reenter the queue and will answer as many as we can during the remainder of the hour. Operator, we are ready for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rick Wise of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise","Good evening, Mike and congrats another terrific quarter. I guess for question one you are going to submit the final intermediate risk data soon to FDA. Are you know thinking potential approval at the start of the fourth quarter. Can you talk just a little more have you had any dialogue with the FDA and approval does come earlier as I think everybody would hope that would. How quickly could you be ready to fully rollout intermediate risk program or you be ready instantly I mean obviously products approved.","Michael Mussallem","Yes. Yes, thanks Rick. Appreciate it. Yes, it's tough to predict the FDA. What we've said is for modeling purposes to assume an October 1st launch that's what's in our guidance estimates and you can take it from there; of course we're talking FDA all the time and we don't get into the specifics of that, but one of things that you should be aware of is that old out of second - one of the things to be thinking about here is that when you say they're going to give us the approval early excuse me sorry Rick I'm just I am composing myself here voice back.","Rick Wise","Take you time. ","Michael Mussallem","So the approval is likely to come. I think as we suggest that it's tough to know we have regular dialogue with the FDA about it. Remember that this is a product that's already approved and in the hands of hospitals. So given that that's the case this is only an indication expansion.","We will be training our team and our sites on how to handle that to make sure that they indicate the proper patients for this, but other that we expect to be ready for the launch. With big production increase of course that's a bit of a strain on our manufacturing operations but we expect to be able to handle all that. Thanks.","Rick Wise","And just one follow-up for Scott if I could, Scott maybe a talk little more about the inventory drag, because of the OUS inventory when does it run off and when will be manufacturing investments realize and maybe gross margin expansion benefit. Thanks.","Scott Ullem","Sure. So it's actually not its inventories outside of the U.S. that have been replaced by. higher value inventories with the strengthening of the U.S. to higher value inventories with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. So we call last year in 2015 we had protection as foreign currencies weakened and so our gross profit margin rate was higher than it would have otherwise been now that we've depleted those inventories and they\u2019re being replaced by U.S. dollar denominated inventories, we\u2019re now seeing that come through in our lower gross margin.","And just to give you some detail on that our gross margin was about 290 basis points lower, 380 basis points of that was related to this inventory phenomenon. There was another 70 basis points reduction from operations including some manufacturing capacity expansion. And then the mix improvement helped gross margin by about 200 basis points.","Rick Wise","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","David Lewis","Good afternoon. Maybe two questions, maybe one for Mike and then give Mike a rest and give one for Scott. But Mike just thinking about revenue guidance for the remainder of the year. You know I think I guess the first question is, have you seen any appreciable change in the market sort of post ACC. And if you think about the guidance, which obviously was raised it again. It still implies some of the deceleration into the back half of the year. Is there anything, we should be thinking about other than the difficult timeline of the FDA approval. And I have a quick one for Scott.","Michael Mussallem","Yes. Thanks David. I\u2019m not sure that we could say we really saw anything change post ACC. I mean think about for a quarter we just reported it\u2019s the 64% growth and we said the bulk of that is a growing market. So the U.S. market is growing fast and it\u2019s tough to pick out whether it's changed very much.","When we say that there is a pick up, when we added a $100 million to transcatheter heart valves, there was - there is several things in there some of that includes the earlier FDA. But also we do expect that the momentum coming out of Q1 and just a positive data out of ACC also contributed to that. So that\u2019s all rolled into our guidance and that's helpful.","David Lewis","Okay, perfect. And then Scott we\u2019ve come back to the question you've asked several times this is around SG&A. And you know the gap between SG&A and revenue growth widened again this quarter. I think it was nine points in 2015 and widened again here in the first quarter. I guess what narrows the gap in the near term? Or is it just going to be a lumpy where we see sort of a widening gap between revenue growth and SG&A. During market expansion periods and then sort of the opposite, opposite there after?","Scott Ullem","Yes, well. David we\u2019re trying carefully to manage growth in SG&A expenses as you know. And so the longer we can do that and the longer we can maintain that difference between growth rate in sales and growth rate in SG&A the better. That said we do have some headwinds coming out in 2016 relating to SG&A and so we're trying to manage through those. But generally we think we're on the right trajectory.","David Lewis","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mr. Weinstein your line is live. ","Michael Weinstein","Can you hear me now?","Michael Mussallem","We can hear you.","Michael Weinstein","Perfect, sorry I thought you could hear me the first time, I apologize. Mike sorry to hear you are not sounding so good. But hope you feel better. So, Mike the question people care about most is kind of what's going to change post PARTNER II.","And in addition to the feedback that you've gotten from the clinical community. Just number one obviously to the overall results and your thoughts about the treatment of intermediate risk patients. And two the willingness to change treatment patterns or practice patterns prior to the actual FDA label change?","Michael Mussallem","Yeah. Thanks for that. And thanks I actually feel better than I sound. So you know post ACC. There people are obviously feeling very good about, we\u2019ve got an incredible amount of very positive feedback from clinicians and you know much of what they appreciate most, is that they have got this really solid large piece of high quality data that they can rely on for decision making. And I keep hearing that over and over again.","I don't know what it changes on day-to-day practice. I think because there's an NCD in place, people try to stay - people try and stay pretty disciplined. But as we know there's not a bright line between high risk patients and intermediate risk patients. And we wonder if in these sort of borderline patients, if these heart teams will decide to say hey borderline patients.","If these heart teams will decide to say hey, that\u2019s a good thing I think that person is close enough to the high risk and we would deem it that way. So I would expect some of that to happen, but as I point out, the market is already grown in a pretty healthy pace here and we\u2019ve taken guidance up more, so it tells you about our confidence in the future.","Michael Weinstein","So let me ask just on the guidance update, and Mike can get a rest on this one, but at the $0.10 increase in guidance by incorporate the beat on the quarter relative to say the midpoint of your range, so let\u2019s call out of a \u2013 we have $0.04 beat versus the mid-point, so $0.06 increase in guidance for the balance of the year. How much of that is the increase in your TAVR projections and what's the impact from FX versus your guidance after the fourth quarter call? Thanks.","Scott Ullem","Sure. So in terms of sales TAVR increase is $100 million. In terms of total sales increase, it's about $55 million dollars of FX due to the weaken of the U.S. dollar since February. So in terms of earnings, the benefit of that THV sales growth has fallen through to the bottom line, but it's offset by several different factors, some in cost of sales and some in SG&A. But principally the improvement to the bottom line Mike is due to the THV sales increase.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. And then Scott just left things, so if I look at the incremental operating margin on your revenues this quarter and think about it over the balance of the year. That incremental drop through increases or decreases in your view?","Scott Ullem","So there is going to be a decrease drop through in the later part of the year, because some things have changed since our first quarter. As we've looked at the incremental boost that we see in the momentum we see in TAVR, we\u2019ve decided to take some pretty aggressive action around increasing our manufacturing capacity.","And that I\u2019ll give you couple of specific examples. We are really actively at all of our facilities around the world now, accelerating our recruiting and our hiring, training. We are running significant over time costs and we're also investing in the infrastructure in each of our locations to meet demand. And so these are couple of reasons why we're getting less drop through now than we did in the first quarter. We've also decided to pull forward into 2016 some expenses to start a new Greenfield production facility for valves.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a good quarter. Sorry, Mike I have a couple of question for you, I apologies.","Michael Mussallem","Okay.","Larry Biegelsen","So the OUS TAVR sales I think were about $150 million up about I think you said 13%. What is the guidance assume for the rest of the year for international TAVR growth and does the intermediate risk data, the Ultra launch later this year I believe and CENTERA launches, CENTERA launches that later next year accelerate that in 2017. So basically my question is how should we think about your OUS TAVR growth going forward and I had a follow-up. Thanks.","Michael Mussallem","Okay, thanks. Larry, we\u2019ve anticipated probability that those OUS growth rates stay relatively consistent for the rest of the year. I mean the good news is here Europe is still growing in our estimation more than 20%, we are seeing nice expansion in Japan, but we don't think that you're going to see a lot of people aggressively treating intermediate risk patients.","We've had some people that are already aggressive adopters like in Germany, that probably have already gone to the place where they ignore euro score, focus more on heart team judgment and consider age as a factor when they assess risk. But in the other countries, we believe that they're going to probably wait for the indication expansion for the changing of guidelines and particularly in places where reimbursement exists. That will be a factor because unless reimbursement expands it will limit the expansion. So we're a little conservative about that having any really quick uptake OUS.","Larry Biegelsen","But Mike I\u2019m trying to just understand more broadly, your OUS growth has slowed a little bit. And so is where \u2013 if we look even beyond 2016 do you think you can accelerate sales again or is it just we get into the lot of big numbers here, where it might be \u2013 it's good growth, but it might just kind of saw big numbers here where it might be its good growth but it might just kind of taper off over time.","Michael Mussallem","I think what happened Larry is it probably does flatten to some extent, but where it gets the left is when there is an indication expansion. So for example we get formally got intermediate risk we think that will be a pickup in the growth rate OUS and a matter of fact you know later on when we think when we get lower risk patients that will be another kick-up, but we think that those will happen in kind of steps if you will and that where - we're at a point now where we've had high risk approved for a number of years OUS.","Larry Biegelsen","So Mike I am really apologize so I am going to another question, but I hope you understand the spirit of the question but one of the most common questions - the stocks have about 40% year-to-date. After a few good years of performance it\u2019s well appreciated now I think that the intermediate risk data was strong and the opportunities large.","So probably the most common question, I get nowadays is why should I buy on the stock now after such a great run. So my question for you is Mike what do you say to investors who don't own the stock today and say you know I missed it all the good news is priced in? Thanks.","Michael Mussallem","Yes, well you know we've indicated Larry that we thank the transcatheter aortic valve market first and foremost. It is more than $5 billion opportunity once you get out. Just a few years from where we are right now. We think that there is more and more evidence to believe that that is real. And we're on a pathway to we think clearly get intermediate risk. Before the end of this year and then just a few years out we'd like to think that we're going to be successful for our low risk trial.","I think broadly and this is been consistent over the years. There's been an underestimation of the number of people that don't have their aortic stenosis treated. And those people will continue to come off the sidelines as you have are really effective and safe procedure for them and that's first and foremost.","Beyond that we love our core businesses and Surgical Heart Valves and Critical Care we think they're going to grow nicely at above market rates and we've got quite a pipeline filled with really exciting new opportunities that's all be it will have risk, but also have very big market opportunities all of these opportunities to be able to treat structural heart disease with catheter-based technologies.","And those are significant each by themselves and will get a chance to play that out. So we're very bullish about our future and even though. We've had a great run. I don't think that we're close to having. All of the potential good things that could happen being reflected in our value.","Scott Ullem","Larry I\u2019ll add one additional perspective from a financial point of view which is even despite all of the investments we're making to expand the market, expand therapy, development, grow, require capacity to meet demand. We're still getting good P&L leverage and so we expect that the earnings power of this company will continue to improve and we're generating significant cash flow.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking my questions guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Roman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Roman","Thank you. Good afternoon. I just want to clarify one of the responses you gave to Larry's dilutive questions on international. When you said growth rates flat now you referring to the rate of growth are you actually expecting your international tabby business to grow to actually to flatten out. Before you see reacceleration from a new indication.","Michael Mussallem","Well, I guess all I was indicating is its already flattening compared to what we had seen in the past. When we tried to be consistent here we've been talking about Europe that\u2019s growing plus 20% so that's pretty substantial growth right. And that's flattened from where it was not long ago that's all it was indicating David.","David Roman","Okay. So just sort of the rate of growth. And then maybe just a follow-up on your comments around the U.S. market I think as we look back to the February call that is or your view around the strength of the U.S. market maybe turned out to be more related to your own performance to the respect market your game by the time Medtronic report it sounds like your commentary here is similar to what you provided in February?","Can you maybe just help us understand now that you have the benefit of looking back over the past several months. How much of this do you think is market share again versus what would appear to be acceleration in market growth from what was reported in the fourth calendar quarter?","Michael Mussallem","You know David we believe that the vast majority of the growth that we enjoy that was procedure your growth. So, broadly that the vast majority of the growth that we enjoy that was procedure growth. So broadly across the market, we say there is some modest share gain in the U.S. But that's really not the principle story.","David Roman","Okay. And then lastly just on the margin side for Scott I mean understanding that you're pulling forward some of these investments in manufacturing to build out capacity. When do we kind of reach a conclusion on that because the dynamic around favorable product mix would seem like your gross margin should be able to get out of that range it seems stuck in but we just haven't seen that on a reported basis now.","Scott Ullem","That's a good question. We expect that we get more leverage in cost of sales as some of these remediation investments that we made last year started to roll off. And we are almost through all those remediation activities that were shorter term in nature. But now with this significantly increased expectations around sales and volume requirements we're really having to invest heavily in facilities, capacity and all of the expenses I mentioned earlier around labor. So I'd like to say that that this is all going to go away but I think for the foreseeable future we're going to continue to invest in order to support the top line growth.","David Roman","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jason Mills of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Jason Mills","Thanks, guys for taking the question. I apologize for the background noise. I am traveling. Scott, sticking with the operating leverage question back of the envelope but I\u2019m probably off a little bit here it looks like you are spending taking the opportunity to spend away perhaps as much as 100 to 120 basis points of operating margin this year. That you maybe could have captured vis-\u00e0-vis the TAVI upside that are spending in these investments that you\u2019ve talked about it.","As you think about moving forward I understand you're not going to give guidance for 2017. Do you start to capture some of that leverage that you're sort of taking away from the business this year vis-\u00e0-vis the investments next year or does it take longer than that?","Scott Ullem","Well, I think we're already capturing it, which is why you're seeing a significant drop through from sales growth into our earnings per share and obviously we want to make that wider and really leverage our scale around these investments that we're making in both gross margin and SG&A. So I won't say that those investments are going to stop and all the sudden we are going to have a materially different P&L. But I will say that we are continuing to get leverage out of these investments and really trying to control growth in expenses as we grow revenue.","Jason Mills","Got it. But is it fair to say that you are making investments that otherwise your gross \u2013 your operating margin at the top end of the guidance right now looks to be somewhere around 28% would be a 100 and 120 basis points higher. Is that match in the ballpark?","Scott Ullem","I think maybe I can answer it this way. I think overall operating margins from 2015 to 2016 should go up by around a 100 basis point and so without trying to break it down quarter-by-quarter or by line item SG&A versus R&D that may be one way to get at your question.","Jason Mills","Okay. Thank you. And then Mike maybe just as a follow up for you. What did you see in terms of new centers that commenced SAPIEN practices during the quarter whether you want to talk about U.S. or globally and could you also maybe preview for us some things","to come at your PCR? Thanks for taking the questions guys. Congrats on a great quarter.","Michael Mussallem","Yes, thanks Jason. Yes, I think what we said before is that we expect around 400 sites, we expect that to increase maybe 10% or 40 sites during 2016. I think we are out of path to do that. So I don't know the precise number for Q1. But I think it's pretty consistent with that sort of a ramp. In terms of PCR I don't know that you're going to see anything like you saw at ACC, where you are going to see those kind of large trials. I'm sure they're going to be a lot of transcatheter heart valve papers and news. But I\u2019m not expecting anything that's major that really is going to cause - really change in terms of behavior at least not in my mind. ","Jason Mills","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Raj Denhoy of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Raj Denhoy","Hi, good afternoon. I wonder if I could maybe ask a bit about mitral you gave a little bit of an update in terms of still beginning the trial this year. But also that you're looking to make some changes to the valves of CardiAQ Valve and I'm just curious in the last few months, if your thoughts have changed really on the timing or how long it will take to get a viable valve to market?","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, thanks Raj. I have to say going into this year I would consider it a major victory, if we could stay on path to begin a CE Mark trial by midyear and I was always pleased to report that we're actually doing that. There's an awful lot that goes on behind the scenes as we try to indicate. We're implementing a number of enhancements to that CardiAQ platform is really one of our earliest versions of this transcatheter valve.","But we still have a lot to learn, so we're going to be jumping in this trial, we are enthusiastic about getting into the trial, but we have to admit we're on a steep learning curve and we're putting a priority. I\u2019m getting that clinical experience because as we get that it gives us so much more guidance in terms of how we ought to be running the program. So as we try to say a lot of uncertainty and timelines at this point because of \u2013 because how early it is with these programs, but we're pleased with where we are right now.","Raj Denhoy","Okay. Maybe I could just ask one about Europe as well, you did mention competition remains so easy even getting worse there in pricing, seems like it's getting worse as well. Maybe you could just offer a bit about how you are doing in that environment for a while when [indiscernible] commanded a premium or still is able to hold a premium price in a lot of European markets. Is that still the case, do you expect you're going to have to start to concede a bit on price in order to hold share there. Maybe some thoughts about the European market would be helpful?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. Well thanks for that. Yes. What I tried to indicate in the prepared remarks Raj was we indicated that the newer entrants, we estimated that and it's really hard to estimate because there is not any really good external source, so we pieced together a lot of things, but we estimate that somewhere in the neighborhood of 15% of that European share that these competitors would have. I think when we reported that number in Q1 of last year, so year-over-year it was around 10%. So there was about a 5% movement there. That's what I was trying to reflect in my remarks.","In terms of how we're behaving, we're really not changing our pricing practices. We have \u2013 our pricing has been very stable. We do have some very small downward drift, but that's purely based on volume discounts and it's been consistent with what we've been doing. And we continue to have a substantial price premium versus competitors. I don't know where it is, but it's \u2013 our estimate is in the 10% to 20% range.","Raj Denhoy","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bruce Nudell of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Bruce Nudell","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the call. Scott a question for you and then a follow-up to Mike. We did some math today and looked at what you guys have spent on structural heart since the PVT acquisition. It looks like 1.5 billion to 2 billion bucks through 2015, and just could you \u2013 just kind of give us how you think about that in the context of ramping up on mitral and tricuspid program and what that means and how you will gate it with regards to either keeping R&D is a constant percent of revenue or keeping the absolute dollar amount in check?","Scott Ullem","Yes, it's a little bit of both. We are very deliberate and how we stage and sequence investments in these new growth platforms and opportunities. So similar to the development of the SAPIEN platform in the family of valves and we invested significantly on the way in developing clinical evidence, while also investing in actual new product design and we are intended to do the same thing when you look at things like our transcatheter mitral valve program and even form on the tricuspid side. And so our strategy is really unchanged, it's been very disciplined, but also to be long-term oriented in the way we invest in new product technologies and then commercialize those and really generate topline growth that turns into earnings.","Michael Mussallem","I\u2019m just going to just pile out a little bit to your question, when I think about the $1.5 billion I mean part of what encourages us to make that investment as we saw a lot of green lights along the way. And when you see an opportunity that\u2019s significant, then it's what encourages to do that spending. If we didn't see that, obviously we're not obligated to have that kind of sense. So this was sort of incremental spend each step of the way.","Bruce Nudell","Oh sure. And but just looking forward Mike to Europe once again everybody's focused on it. Do you feel that CENTERA or some other product innovation or maybe just the strength of your clinical data and warning able you to kind of whole share in your clinical data we will enable you to kind of the whole share in Europe which is you know pretty robust market still.","Michael Mussallem","Yes, as you point out Bruce, since it's very competitive marketplace there's at least, five or six competitors and we have by far of the strong share leadership we're very proud of that and we expect that to endure over time. And as you say part of the way that we're going to do that is with our new product introductions.","So SAPIEN 3 has been fantastic but we're certainly not going to stop there behind that is ultra and then more yet and as you properly point out CENTERA. So we don't intend to stop improving this therapy we think there's still a long way for it to go and we think that's going to separate us. I think it's going to challenge our competitors to be able to keep pace.","Bruce Nudell","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Kristen Stewart","Hi, thanks for taking my question. If you could just focus on the surgical valve business. or surgical heart valve therapy business and if you could just break out what the impact of discontinued was?","Scott Ullem","I'll take that Kristen. So recall last year we had guided to $10 to $20 million in total discontinued sales and by the end of last year we had achieved about $15 million of that there's probably another $5 million or so to come in 2016 or more to the tail end of it. It will probably show up most in the first half less in the second half. But that's how the discontinued operations are proceeding.","Kristen Stewart","Just like to $2 million of quarter or so not that significant.","Scott Ullem","Yes, it's not significant and again it's more first half weighted than second half weighted for the remaining $5 million or so to be discontinued.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. And then more broadly key just maybe speak to different dynamics in the U.S. versus Europe and if you've seen any change in surgical heart valve patterns whether it be in Germany or not just you know growth rates as a transcatheter valve had rolled out waiting you\u2019ve seen thus far in accounts?","Michael Mussallem","Maybe I could make a quick comment here Kristen. So overall I think as we correctly as you pointed out aortic units we're grew great once again this quarter I think was up around 7% and they were up in a combination of U.S., Europe and Japan. So the big geographies are still growing. I think of probably most impacted in Germany but even in Germany the surgical valve business remained robust for us and we feel like the addition of product like INTUITY which we have there help us continue to maintain the growth rate.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. So the reason why that line excess is only growing modestly is that more pricing them should think about it in that contracts?","Michael Mussallem","What's growing modestly I'm sorry.","Scott Ullem","I'll take it the actual valve business grew about 7% in the first quarter. It was offset by this discontinuation of the non-strategic cannula products. So that the core valve business continues to grow nicely.","Kristen Stewart","In sales dollars?","Scott Ullem","In sales dollars, yes.","Kristen Stewart","And units, okay.","Scott Ullem","And you have both its sales and units you know the pricing and surgical valves is generally over the years been stable. So we're seeing still attractive unit volume growth.","Kristen Stewart","Okay perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matt Miksic of UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Mussallem","Matt, we are not hearing you.","Matt Miksic","Can you hear me, okay.","Michael Mussallem","Yes.","Matt Miksic","Yes, I don't know what happened here to my headset sorry about that. So I had a couple of longer-term questions. Mike if you could just maybe help sketch out how they have their opportunities are folding and what some of these other opportunities might be longer-term.","So the first on these category segments of patients that we've talked a lot about high risk intermediate low and how I think most folks yourself included is get out in December talked about. Yes maybe less than 25% high risk and maybe a third is intermediate maybe half as low one. As we get into this you also mentioned that high risk is you know as we're discovering, maybe a bit bigger than we thought - patients coming in or patients are sicker you know they are mid single-digit STS.","But they're actually quite sicker \u2013 after sicker, they are mid single-digit STS but they're actually quite sicker. Do you see any of that happening here as we get into intermediate risk and could we start seeing kind of a larger front half of the market if you will and maybe an easing back half if you want to think about it that way. And then I had one follow up.","Michael Mussallem","Yes, you know I don't know that this is going to unfold over a matter of months. But if we\u2019ve watched it unfold over a matter of years, I wouldn't be surprised if there is much more life to this Matt. You know we defined people with their [indiscernible] by looking at people that received open heart surgery to have their valve replaced. And now that we have this catheter based option, we learn that there is many more patients out there and we're still learning that it's a disease that is under diagnosed and in many cases even when it is diagnosed it\u2019s under treated.","And so we're still on a steep learning curve there. We think that that could go on for a while and we're still continuing to find up sides if you will that could be very meaningful. I think the key is for us to have a very safe procedure, you know when we talk about this you know the past notions were you had to have severe aortic stenosis and symptoms. I think everything will be challenged in the future when you have a procedure that's you know under 1% mortality and 1% stroke at 30 days it starts getting interesting to say what should be my course of treatment.","Matt Miksic","And then the - that's helpful. And a follow-up is on this question of durability. Another kind of long term question for the market. And clinicians we have spoken to seems that are increasingly be you know bringing up the idea of valve and valve as the potential answer to long-term durability in much the way it's the answer for surgical tissue valves over time. And just wondering if that's something, we\u2019ll hear more about in terms of your clinical programs or product designs or how you think about that. You know the idea of sort of replacement tab or over the long term being part of this market.","Michael Mussallem","Yes, thanks for that Matt. You know I think as it has been demonstrated valve and valve really is a good option down the road for a number of patients but that's not the way we're really approaching this. We'd really like to demonstrate that transcatheter heart valves and hopefully as we continue to introduce valves, we're able to do this that have them last a long time.","We're fortunate to say that now and tens of thousands of patients have been in studies, we really haven\u2019t seen a signal that indicates that structural valve deterioration is an issue. So we're encouraged by that, but we still have a ways for it to play out, but no I don't think that the primary answer is going to be valve and valve. I think that we should be able to develop valves that have some pretty reasonable durability.","Matt Miksic","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink. Please go ahead.","Danielle Antalffy","Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on another great quarter. Mike I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about reimbursement intermediate risk and how you just think about timing for that, what needs to happen on the reimbursement side once we get the FDA approval and whether that might be a barrier to adoption here in the near and medium term?","Michael Mussallem","Thanks Danielle. So the way that the NCD is written with a label change automatically comes a reimbursement. So it's really coverage to label the way the NCD is designed, so if that continues as this we would expect with intermediate risk that accounts can very simply continue to do what they've done in the past. Now in Europe and other regions guidelines are probably have to change first and then remember reimbursement is really managed on a country by country basis. So each country will have to go through that process and that will be what it is. We've been able to manage through that in the past, but we think that to take some time.","Danielle Antalffy","Okay. And what about the requirement for you need a surgeon, you need multiple nurses I believe I don\u2019t have any exact numbers, but within the NCD and whether that just from a capacity perspective could be a limiting factor and what you're seeing hospitals do to maybe work around that to increase volumes and take in the increasing number of patients that inevitably will occur with intermediate risk?","Michael Mussallem","That remains the same, we are still operating under the NCD, so if your question will the NCD change that's a different question, we've not request reopening of the NCD. So we'll continue to operate under the same requirements as the current one.","Danielle Antalffy","Okay and last question for you on the surgical valve side of things obviously with intermediate risk eventually hopefully a low risk. How do you look at the long-term outlook for the surgical valve business I mean you know we\u2019re talking to some doctors saying 80% of intermediate risk patients will be getting a TAVR within 12 months now that those are high volume docs, but what is the outlook long-term for surgical valves in the context of a growing TAVR market. Thanks so much.","Michael Mussallem","Thanks for that. We think that that will indeed happen that patients with isolated aortic stenosis more and more going to be treated with TAVR instead of surgery. But this is there's still going to be - this will be a slow process low risk is still going to be treated by surgery. And that over time there are a number of things that are underlying trends that cause us to believe that surgical valves will continue to grow. There is an aging global demographics. There is a lot of patients internationally that don't get access to technology today.","There are some really exciting surgical innovations coming like INTUITY and more they are still patients getting mechanical valves if you can believe it but I imagine what sources of tissue over time. So there's a number of factors and we're going to help try and fill that. So we're optimistic that we're still going to have a positive growth rate even though there is going to be a very significant move up TAVR into intermediate risk patients.","Danielle Antalffy","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next questions is from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn Novarro","Hi, good afternoon guys. Two questions. First has to do with the ability of the U.S. TAVR centers to absorb the influx of intermediate patients. Since ACC we've done a lot of checks in it. It seems like U.S. TAVR centers have been anticipating the intermediate label and have been making plans to expand their capacity, but Mike I just wanted to hear from you have you been hearing consistent type of feedback as you\u2019ve been traveling since ACC and I guess I'm asking just because I want to make sure that you know once the intermediate label is added in the United States we don't start to see bottlenecks it U.S. centers that\u2019s question one. And then question two is you're going to be. We're going to seen any new mitral data at PCR from Edwards. Thank you.","Michael Mussallem","Thanks Glenn. Like you as you know each side has their own unique issue, but we've been really impressed with the ability to hospitals to add capacity and we expect that they're going to continue to do it. Even with the expansion of guidance that we provided for 2016. The capacity increase for an average hospital in the U.S. is relatively small probably less than 10%. So we really don't think that the capacity increase for hospitals are probably a constraint in the near-term and we don't get a lot of signals back from our hospital customers that they're overly concerned about it. They seem to have something in the works in most places.","As it relates to mitral valve we don't expect any major clinical updates at Europe PCR and I would guess they'll be some incremental information share, but remember we're in an early feasibility trial. So there's really no major clinical updates to share at this time. I would have thought I cared later in the year.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. Thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","Okay well, thanks for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, David and I welcome any additional questions by telephone.

And for 2011, excluding special items, we were able to achieve 10% net income growth while increasing R&D by 20% and making considerable investments in our US launch.","Now turning to quarterly results. Reported sales grew 10% to $430 million, which was consistent with the guidance provided at our investor conference. On an underlying basis, sales grew 8%. Sales outside the US grew 11% on a reported basis and represent nearly two-thirds of our total sales.","For heart valve therapy, reported sales for the fourth quarter grew 13% to $257 million, which included $93 million from transcatheter heart valves. Surgical heart valves grew 2% over last year on a reported basis and were unchanged on an underlying basis. ","Outside the US, our surgical heart valve business reported 7% growth, driven primarily by strong sales in Asia and continued penetration of premium products. Pricing remains stable in each geography. However, strong growth in emerging markets changed the country mix, which slightly lowered our global average price.","In the US, sales declined this quarter due to the introduction of a competitor\u2019s product in 2011, along with what we believe were flat procedural volumes. We expect the impact of competition in the US to diminish in the second half of 2012 with the annualization of that product\u2019s introduction.","We continue to make progress on our Edwards INTUITY rapid deployment aortic valve system. We\u2019ve submitted responses to the additional questions we received in late 2011 and now expect CE Mark approval during the first quarter. We will then initiate two European post-approval clinical studies, Cadence and Foundation. Additionally, we remain excited about our next general tissue technology, GLX, for which we anticipate receiving a CE Mark in the second half of 2012.","Turning to cardiac surgery systems, sales for the quarter were $27 million, up 8% on a reported basis and 7% on an underlying basis. These results was primarily due to growth of MIS products, which are recovering from the product availability issues earlier in 2011.","Late in the fourth quarter, we received both a CE Mark and a 510K clearance for our IntraClude aortic occlusion device, designed to reduce the learning curve for MIS mitral valve surgery. We continue to expect the limited launch in the first quarter as we collect additional clinical evidence. IntraClude is the first of several new products we expect to introduce into our MIS portfolio in 2012. ","As a reminder, beginning this year, we will be reporting sales of surgical heart valves and cardiac surgery system products together in a product line called Surgical Heart Valve Therapy. In 2012, we expect to achieve underlying sales growth of 3% to 5% in this product line, driven by expected improvement in valve procedure volumes and continued momentum of our newest products.","Turning to transcatheter heart valves, fourth quarter sales were $93 million, a 43% growth rate over last year. Although the US launch was later than we anticipated, it was a significant growth driver. Economic pressure in southern Europe resulted in lower procedural volumes, which affected our growth rate.","Transapical sales were comparable to levels reported in previous quarters, although the impact of two recently approved products in Europe trimmed sales approximately $1 million this quarter. Transfemoral units accounted for approximately 60% of our sales, lifted by the US launch, which today is entirely transfemoral. ","Product pricing remains stable outside the US and inside the US is consistent with our expectations. As you know, in early November we received FDA approval of our SAPIEN valve in the United States for certain inoperable patients. Total US sales in the quarter was just over $17 million, with about half from commercial sales and half from clinicals.","Approximately three-quarters of our commercial sales were stocking units from new centers that completed their training, and we continue to expect to train 150-250 new commercial sites in the first 12 months.","As we have previously stated, achieving and maintaining a high level of acute procedural success, just as we have in Europe, is our first priority, and will drive the pace of the SAPIEN rollout. While we\u2019ve just begun, we\u2019re very pleased with our high success rate.","Last fall, CMS initiated a national coverage analysis for TAVR, which is expected to result in a national coverage determination, or NCD. This early NCD process has resulted in inconsistent interpretations among the regional Medicare contractors. The majority of these Medicare payers are reimbursing on a case-by-case basis, while policies of others are still evolving.","This uncertainty has led to somewhat lower than expected sales. Edwards, along with physicians, hospitals, and medical societies are working to ensure that patients throughout the US have adequate access. We believe this reimbursement situation will improve as payers clarify their policies.","In the last hour, CMS has posted on their website a proposed decision memo for TAVR. This 88-page document appears to be very comprehensive, and while we welcome the accelerated timeline, we\u2019ve not yet had adequate time to assess it. As a reminder, it should trigger a 30-day public comment period and suggests that a formal NCD could issue in the next 90 days. We support a well-written NCD that ensures adequate patient access.","Even with this temporary uncertainty, in the first quarter we expect to achieve commercial and clinical SAPIEN sales of $30 million to $40 million in the United States."," Earlier this week, at the SDS meeting, data from the continued access patients in Cohort A of the PARTNER trial were presented by Doctor Todd Dewey. In this much-larger group of patients, the data showed an improved transapical experience. Investigators observe a trend toward patients feeling better faster and having improved outcomes. ","We believe this more recent experience adds strong new support to the transapical procedure as an important option for patients who are at high risk for surgery. We expect additional data to be presented at medical meetings during the year, including two-year data from Cohort A at ACC meeting in March.","We continue to plan for a mid-year 2012 PMA approval for Cohort A of PARTNER, preceded by an FDA advisory panel. We remain confident that the trial results clearly demonstrate the benefits of both TA and TF as less-invasive treatment options for high-risk surgical patients. We are preparing extensively for this panel meeting and are providing to FDA additional data and analysis of our clinical experience to support our case.","Turning to our PARTNER 2 clinical study, in January we completed enrollment in Cohort B, studying inoperable patients using our SAPIEN XT technology. Patients will be followed for one year, and we continue to plan for US approval in 2014. For Cohort A, the surgical arm, we remain on track to complete enrollment in 2013. As a reminder, Cohort A is a noninferiority study of up to 2,000 patients with a lower risk profile than those that were enrolled in the PARTNER trial.","Patients are being evenly randomized to receive the Edwards SAPIEN XT valve or surgery. Those undergoing transcatheter valve replacement are being treated either transfemorally or transapically. ","As we unveiled in December at our investor conference, we have two new low-profile transcatheter valve platforms we\u2019re very excited about, which we believe will enable us to further extend our leadership position. SAPIEN 3 is our next-generation balloon expandable valve that builds on all our knowledge and experience and includes a unique feature designed to further reduce perivalvular leaks. ","We\u2019re pleased to have recently completed successful first-in-man cases. CENTERA is our repositionable self-expanding valve, featuring a motorized delivery system designed for stable deployment and single operator use. European clinical trials for both these new products, which are delivered through a 14-French e-sheath are expected to commence in 2012.","We plan to initiate the pro TAVI trial at the end of this quarter, that will study the causes of stroke as well as our umbrella device. The results of this study should become available in 2012, and could support a 510-K for umbrella in the US.","With respect to the appeal regarding the Andersen patent dispute with CoreValve in the US, we expect a decision by the court in mid-2012. In December, we filed a request to extend the Andersen US patent out to 2017 and we expect our request to be granted. ","In summary, we continue to expect 2012 underlying transcatheter heart valve sales to grow 70% to 90% over last year. This would result in sales of $560 million to $630 million, which includes $200 million to $260 million of clinical and commercial sales in the US. Our sales guidance assumes PARTNER Cohort A is approved and starts contributing to US sales in mid-year 2012.","Turning to critical care, sales were $133 million for the quarter, up 4.5% on a reported basis, which includes a 2.4% benefit from foreign exchange. Without approximately $5 million of discontinued products, the bulk of which annualizes after the first quarter of 2012, growth would have been lifted by 4.5%.","Driving the growth this quarter were strong sales of our advanced monitoring products, including our EV1000 monitoring hardware and FloTrac. Pressure monitoring sales contributed to global critical care growth as we continued to gain share.","We are currently gaining clinical experience in Europe on our latest in-hospital glucose system and plan to evaluate additional enhancements in mid-year. We continue to anticipate obtaining a CE Mark for this improved system before the end of 2012.","Total reported vascular sales, which is comprised of our Fogarty products, were $13 million this quarter, down slightly from the prior year. As a reminder, next quarter we\u2019ll be reporting sales of critical care and vascular in the critical care product line. For 2012, we continue to expect full year underlying sales growth in this product line to be 5% to 8%, driven primarily by continued growth in our advanced monitoring products.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. ","Thomas Abate","Thank you Mike. This quarter we achieved diluted EPS of $0.53 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.62, an increase of 13% over the past year. As we anticipated, our operating leverage improved sequentially to 20%, driven by reduced FX impact and the US THV sales. Including the benefit of a much lower tax rate, this quarter\u2019s non-GAAP EPS exceeded expectations. Excluding this benefit, we would have achieved the low end of our EPS guidance. ","For the quarter, excluding special items, net income grew 12%. For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 72.2% compared to 71.1% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven primarily by a more-profitable product mix. For 2012, we continue to expect our gross profit margin to be between 73% and 75%, building throughout the year as THV sales grow.","Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $163 million, or 38% of sales, an increase of $21 million of the prior year. This increase was driven primarily by US transcatheter launch-related investments. We continue to expect SG&A to be between 36% and 39% of sales for full year 2012. Driven by launch-related expenses, the first two quarters will be approximately 40%, followed by a significant step down in the third quarter and then again in the fourth quarter, due to the expedient sales ramp.","R&D investments in the quarter grew 9% to $61 million, or 14% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of additional investments in clinical studies and new product development efforts in our transcatheter valve programs. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be between 14% and 15%.","During the quarter we recorded a pre-tax $17.6 million special charge, comprised of three items: an $8.8 million charge to reflect the increased collections risk associated with our southern European receivables, a global realignment charge of $5.5 million primarily related to severance costs, and a $3.3 million charge related to a legal settlement. Additionally, during the quarter we recorded a $4 million favorable tax adjustment related to the release of reserves.","Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 8%. Excluding the tax effect of special items I just mentioned, the tax rate was 15%, which benefited from favorable year to date adjustments in both the income mix and the R&D tax credit. For full year 2012, we estimate our rate, excluding special items, to be between 25% and 26%, versus 21% in 2011, full year. ","This rate increase results primarily from the growth of our US-sourced income, which includes the expected THV sales and approved FX hedge outcomes. Our 2012 quarterly rates assume the federal R&D tax rate renewal will not occur until the fourth quarter.","FX rates positively impacted fourth quarter sales by approximately $6 million, compared to the prior year. Compared to our recent guidance, FX did not have a material impact on the quarter\u2019s earnings. Look forward, at current rates we now expect a $40 million negative impact to 2012 full year sales when compared to 2011 rates.","Free cash flow generated during the fourth quarter was $62 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $94 million, less capital spending of $32 million. This resulted in a full year free cash flow of $183 million, which was lower than planned due to higher-than-expected inventories.","During the quarter, we repurchased 560,000 shares for $40 million. For the full year, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $303 million. For modeling purposes, we project diluted shares outstanding to be 119 million in 2012.","Turning to our balance sheet, we had total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $450 million, and total debt of $150 million. The short term investments of $279 million represent bank time deposits with initial maturities ranging from greater than three months to seven months. ","These time deposits are highly liquid, and were included in error in part of our cash and cash equivalents in our 2011 interim statements. We are now reclassifying these time deposits as short term investments, and will reflect their purchases and sales as investing activities in our statement of cash flows for the full year 2011. This change has no effect on any other aspect of our financial statements or guidance. We are currently evaluating the manner in which we correct these previously reported amounts.","Our DSO at the end of the quarter was 65 days, an improvement of 5 days from the prior quarter driven primarily from collections efforts outside the US. Inventory turns were 1.8, a small decrease from the prior quarter.","Turning to our sales guidance, we continue to expect our full year product line sales range to remain unchanged from the guidance we provided at our December investor conference. For surgical heart valve therapy, we expect sales to be between $800 million and $830 million, which includes approximately $115 million of cardiac systems sales. ","In transcatheter heart valves, we expect sales to be between $560 million and $630 million. In critical care, we expect sales of $580 million to $610 million, which includes approximately $50 million of vascular sales. ","We continue to expect full year sales of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion. Excluding special items, we remain comfortable with our previously stated financial goals of full year 2012 diluted EPS of $2.70 to $2.80,73% to 75% gross profit margin, net income growth of 35% to 40%, and free cash flow between $240 million and $260 million.","These goals assume a mid-year 2012 approval of Cohort A of the PARTNER trial. For the first quarter of 2012, we project total sales of $440 million to $460 million, and first quarter diluted EPS, excluding special items, will be between $0.47 and $0.49. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mike. ","Michael Mussallem ","Thanks Tom. As we look ahead, we see an exciting future for Edwards Lifesciences. We believe that our transcatheter valve technology has the potential to drive significant sales growth over the next decade. Our focused strategy on structural heart disease and critical care technologies creates multiple points of leverage and our commitment to innovation should enable us to expend our leadership and create value for patients, clinicians, and our shareholders.","Before I turn the call back over to David, although I\u2019m certain you\u2019ll have many questions about the recently published draft NCD, we\u2019re unprepared to provide analysis at this time. This extensive document requires careful review and consideration. Therefore, we\u2019re not going to be answering questions about this at this time.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to David. ","David Erickson","Thank you Mike. In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and we\u2019ll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the hour. Operator, we\u2019re ready to take questions please. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we will begin conducting a question and answer session. [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Steve [Busha] - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good afternoon. It\u2019s Steve [Busha] here for David. Mike or Larry, I wonder if you could go into a bit more detail articulating the dynamics with SAPIEN in Europe. If we said, just for the sake of discussion, that the results in Europe came in $30 million below where it would have been. In a hypothetical, where the growth rate in the fourth quarter was the same as it was in the third quarter, understanding of course that wasn\u2019t necessarily in the plan, how much of that $30 million was competition? How much was macro? How much was pricing if that\u2019s an issue at all? And how much might have been a shift toward transfemoral? ","Michael Mussallem ","You know, I think there\u2019s some confusion. I don\u2019t know where your $30 million comes from, but I\u2019m happy to walk through some of these pieces. As I indicated on the call, the new competition as it relates to TA, was worth about $1 million, and we don\u2019t feel like we lost share to our other competitor in Europe. So that\u2019s really not a factor. You know where I think sometimes people get confused is when they go back and look at our results and compare it to what we\u2019ve done. So for example, we said there were $334 million worth of sales for the full year of 2011 in transcatheter heart valves. Some of that was US clinical, around $20 million that you have to back out. Some of that came from other parts of the world. That accounted for almost 10% of those sales. And there was another whatever it was, $9 million or so, of commercial US sales. So you need to back those pieces out when you actually compare a growth rate in the quarter. ","Steve [Busha] - Morgan Stanley","Okay, we\u2019ll do that, thanks. And then one follow up on Europe, could you comment on your expectations for the duration of the macro challenges there? Could you elaborate a bit also on how their manifesting there? Is it pricing? Sounds like that\u2019s not the case. Does it manifest just as a receivables issue? Or is there something else? ","Michael Mussallem ","Are you talking about transcatheter heart valves in the quarter in Europe specifically? I\u2019m going to assume that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about. We mentioned that we were affected in southern Europe. And so in particular we saw growth rates decline in places like Greece and Italy and Spain, all of which were good markets for transcatheter heart valves, and so that was the driving force. Pricing\u2019s been rock stable, and you know, our hope here is that this picks back up, that this is a temporary situation driven by some difficult economics in those countries. ","Steve [Busha] - Morgan Stanley","But it sounds like, then, that it\u2019s a temporary situation, and it\u2019s volume. Is that fair? ","Michael Mussallem ","That\u2019s what we\u2019d like to think. I\u2019d like to think that those countries don\u2019t stay in the same sort of straits that they were in in the fourth. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies & Co. Please proceed with your question.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Co. ","Wondering if I could ask about the - you know, I\u2019m not going to ask for the NCD, but you did mention that there\u2019s a little bit of reimbursement pushback right now. And understanding is that part of that was perhaps related to the fact that there wasn\u2019t a national policy. Does the publication of the NCD, regardless of your views of what\u2019s in it, does that have any bearing on the reimbursement situation out there right now? ","Michael Mussallem ","Yeah, I\u2019ll share what our thinking is on that, Raj. It\u2019s a good question. Before an NCD was opened, it seemed as though we had a fair amount of clarity and there was pretty clear coverage by these local providers throughout the clinical trial period, and we would have imagined that that would continue to in a very stable way going forward. When the NCD was actually opened - and it\u2019s relatively unprecedented that an NCD or a national coverage analysis was opened even before approval - it created some of this confusion, and it caused some of these providers to say, gee, I don\u2019t know what this means. Maybe I should wait. And a whole variety of interpretations of what that meant. We\u2019d like to think, when we actually land on a decision, and we\u2019re hopeful that the decisions are good ones, that it clarifies the temporary situation. ","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Co. ","Okay. And then just on your expectations here for a panel soon and approval for PARTNER A by midyear, you also commented about how you\u2019re continuing to supply the FDA with information, whether it\u2019s the continued access data that we saw early this week. You also mentioned the data coming out at ACC here. So there still is data being presented to the FDA, and I\u2019m curious whether that could potentially have some impact on their ability to schedule a panel. ","Michael Mussallem ","I don\u2019t know, frankly, what impacts their scheduling of the panel. We don\u2019t have a date at this point. We believe it\u2019s in the best interest of the technology and to help the FDA with their decision making to have as much up to date clinical experience as possible, and so we\u2019re providing that. And you know, when the date goes out longer, it just allows us to probably even provide more. But I really have no insight into whether that\u2019s driving any decisions on timing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills from Canaccord. Please proceed with your question. ","Jason Mills - Canaccord","I wanted to ask about your training program, Mike, for TAVI, and the early days of commercialization. It\u2019s gratifying to hear that you\u2019re reiterating your guidance of 150 to 250. You had a principal investigator at SDS comment on the podium about his docs maybe getting to 200 by the end of 2013. I suppose I could have heard him wrong, but your commentary seems to suggest you\u2019re confident in getting to 200 perhaps in the first year, which would sort of be exiting this year. Could you talk about over maybe the next 18 months what your thoughts are with respect to the ramp in new training centers, and any color you could provide around how it\u2019s going early with some of the synergy you\u2019ve gotten on board in the first three or four months. ","Michael Mussallem ","I\u2019m not going to get into a specific count of how many people have gone through, but we said right along here that we have expected to train 150 to 250 new centers in the first year, and we haven\u2019t backed off that at all. We\u2019ve built capability, and we have the internal capabilities to certainly train that number of centers and more. So it really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with our internal capability. So what I think what would be more of a factor is whatever comes out in the national coverage termination, whether there\u2019s any limits. If there were limits, that could change the number, but otherwise I would expect that we would stay right on that plan, and we would hit 150 to 250 in the first year and escalate from that into the second year. ","Jason Mills - Canaccord","Yeah, our initial read is it looks like it was a fairly flexible document, and inclusive. So we\u2019ll look forward to hearing your analysis. I suppose on that front, should we expect to see a press release? What form in which do you plan to comment or provide guidance or thoughts on this NCD when and if you\u2019re prepared for it. ","Michael Mussallem ","Yeah, it\u2019s a fair question, Jason. You know, right after this call we\u2019ll get into this and we\u2019ll digital pretty deep. We\u2019re not sure what the best way to communicate is. If we think that we can answer sufficient questions for investors with a press release that we would do it. If it was something that we thought was complex enough that it required a call, we would set something like that up. You know, in terms of actual response to CMS, of course, we would prepare an extensive response within this 30-day public comment period. ","Jason Mills - Canaccord","Great. Last question. Your guidance for US TAVI sales in the first quarter, what percentage of that do you expect to be in the PARTNER 2 trial, the clinical setting, and what percentage either stocking orders or sell-through on the commercial side? ","Michael Mussallem ","It\u2019s a minority portion of that. The clinicals probably account for, I don\u2019t know, 20-25% of those sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David [audio dropped out]. Please proceed with your question. ","David","Just wanted to see if you were going to provide backward-looking details on the breakdown of previously reported transcatheter sales in Europe versus clinical studies. Because I think one of the pieces of confusion in the quarter was the underlying growth rate there relative to what we\u2019ve seen in the past. ","Michael Mussallem ","You know, maybe I can at least give you the headlines on it to get you close to it. The full year we reported at $334 [million]. Within that, US clinicals probably accounted for around $20 million. The rest of the world was probably around 10% of that number, so think $30 million, something plus or minus that range. US commercial, just under $10 million. So hopefully, with those pieces of data, it helps you back into what the baseline is. ","David","Yes. That is a helpful starting point. And maybe just, while you were answering the previous question regarding the 150 to 250 centers, could you just maybe walk us through and remind us how you came up with that number, what sort of the top-down bill was to figure out what the right number of centers to approach was, maybe beginning with how you look at the overall addressable market, and why that is an appropriate number? ","Michael Mussallem ","We\u2019ve always been driven by great results, and that\u2019s going to continue to be our mantra and our top priority as we roll this out. We actually probably have the capability and possibly the interest in even going faster, given that we could stay at a very high procedural level. So we were at a number much larger than that at one time in terms of what we were thinking, but there was a little bit of pushback on the part of societies that said, you know, can you really maintain high quality at that sort of rate, and so this was through some discussions. We felt very comfortable that a 150 to 250 number of additional centers was going to be an appropriate rate for first year rollout. So it\u2019s a bit of a negotiated number, if you will. I don\u2019t know if that gets at your question? ","David","Would you put a number on that, sort of, what percent of what you think the ultimate addressable number of centers is? ","Michael Mussallem ","That\u2019s a great question. I mean, how many centers will actually be doing TAVR when the smoke clears five years or ten years from now is an uncertain number. We know that there are approximately, let\u2019s say, 1200 or so centers that are doing open heart surgery today. And we would imagine that would be, you know, something in maybe half that or less than half that, that end up doing transcatheter heart valves in the long run. But this one is a very difficult number to try and pin down. It\u2019s uncertain, and I think there\u2019s a variety of views out there, and there\u2019ll be some discussion between societies and regulators that will ultimately determine what that looks like. ","David","Okay, and then lastly, for Tom, if you look at the pacing of earnings throughout the course of the year, which you gave very explicitly at the analysts meeting, it really is sort of a tale of two halves, first half versus second half, as the SG&A numbers start to ramp down. How should we think about the normalized earnings power of the business with the commercial US TAVI program? Is fourth quarter the right way to look at it? Is it a blend of the second half? Just to get a sense of when we sort of start to see a more normalized run rate. ","Thomas Abate","","Sure. I\u2019d have to say if you\u2019re looking forward, probably Q4 is your best indication, right? What you\u2019re facing is a lot of investment that was made up front and a pretty dramatic ramp as we add centers each quarter, so each quarter we\u2019re looking at a bigger sales number, obviously, and expenses not going as fast. So I\u2019d say, you know, the exit rate\u2019s probably the best indication, but I would think that you\u2019ve still got an improvement going forward from there. We will continue to invest in everything, but I think those expense ratios will grow slower than sales for the foreseeable next couple of periods.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. ","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Just one clarification. Tom, the $17.6 million in special charges related to southern European receivables risk, that did not affect sales in the quarter, is that correct? ","Thomas Abate ","No. And Larry, only - I think it was 8% of that was receivables related. ","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Anyway, based on the number that you\u2019ve given us, it does look like the OUS TAVI sales were relatively flat sequentially, up just slightly, which is different from what we\u2019ve seen in the fourth quarter typically. Mike, I know you\u2019ve gone through the reasons for that, but help us understand why you would expect it to recover. I mean, did they run out of budgets in the fourth quarter? And you see, you know, new budgets for 2012? ","Michael Mussallem ","It\u2019s a good observation, Larry. Europe in total would have been growing at a pretty rapid pace throughout the year, something in the 40-50% range in terms of total market, and here in the fourth quarter it slowed down a lot. And that\u2019s because we actually had countries that went into negative growth. They were actually lower in the fourth quarter of \u201911 than they were in the fourth quarter of \u201912. These were these southern European countries that actually we had a fair amount of volume in. It\u2019s not the largest in Europe, but enough, certainly, to affect the growth rate. Now you\u2019re asking me to see the future in terms of what\u2019s going to happen in those countries. We know that there\u2019s patients that certainly want transcatheter valve procedures, and we would expect this to begin recovering, but it\u2019s difficult for us to predict exactly when that might happen.  ","Thomas Abate ","And Larry, it wasn\u2019t really flat. It was probably maybe more in the range of the 20s, 20% growth. And sorry, there were a couple pieces that make that hard to trace, but I\u2019d say somewhere in the low 20s is not a bad number for Europe. ","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Tom, you\u2019re saying 20% sequentially? Or 20% up year over year? ","Thomas Abate ","Year over year. ","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Okay. Hey guys, I know you haven\u2019t had a chance to look at the NCD, but there\u2019s one number that has been thrown around there before, and I\u2019m wondering if you know offhand, how many centers in the US do over 50 aortic valve procedures per year? Does anyone know that offhand? ","Michael Mussallem ","Offhand, Larry, there\u2019s around 400 centers in the US that do above 50 AVRs historically. ","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","And last from me. The cap data that we just saw, the transapical cap data, I don\u2019t know if this was asked earlier, but just to confirm, you will be providing that to FDA, and you would expect that to be part of a panel? ","Michael Mussallem ","Yeah, Larry, you have to promise that was question. We\u2019re starting to string them out a little bit there, and we need to leave time for others. But yes, of course we would provide that cap data to FDA.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. ","Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan","Mike, you had commented at the analyst meeting on the trajectory early on and your expectations, and you had said that you thought January would come in, for US SAPIEN sales, in the $10 million to $15 million range. Is that where it played out? ","Michael Mussallem ","It probably came in a little short of that. I think some of this temporary conversion caused it to be a little short of where we thought it would come in. ","Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan","So in your mind, the pushback from a couple of those local carriers that you and I had talked about, that probably has changed the trajectory of the slope for 2012, but hasn\u2019t changed where you think you will end up in total for the year? ","Michael Mussallem ","Well, you know, I think it ends up changing the trajectory here in the short term, until there\u2019s a national coverage determination. And I\u2019m optimistically hoping that this document that was published today starts providing some clarity. But in the interim period it appears that the ramp is affected by this uncertainty. But you can see, because we\u2019re reaffirming our full 2012 numbers, we\u2019re still feeling confident that as this gets cleared up that we\u2019ll be able to get back on that ramp and stay in our range. ","Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan","Okay. Let me just ask a couple quick of followups. And one of the questions people have is the play back and forth between the TAVI ramp and the surgical valve business, and it\u2019s tough to extract out the impact of obviously competitors launch, how that\u2019s impacted your business, but if we look at your constant currency, either your surgical valve growth over the course of 2011, or the total company growth ex-TAVI for 2011. So if I looked at total company, it was 8% in the first quarter, 4.9% in the second, 3.7% in the third, and 1.3% in the fourth. It does suggest that ex-what\u2019s happening on the TAVI side of the business, the other part did decelerate. And could you just comment on the confidence level on that reaccelerating in 2012? Because the guidance does imply some reacceleration. ","Michael Mussallem ","It\u2019s a good point, and I hear the stories that those numbers tell, but there\u2019s a little more going on besides that. The first question of last year, for some inexplicable reason, we saw a very high procedural growth across the board, so that was that. Then we saw competitors come in for the first time in the second quarter. That suppressed growth rate for a while, and you can see that that had some impact during the year. And then toward the tail end of the year, we felt that the economy in general sort of slowed procedures. So you have three things going on there. You know, I think that when we anniversary this competition, that we\u2019re going to get a lift out of our growth out of that. And we don\u2019t think that people save up heart valve procedures forever. And so we expect there to be some lift. On top of that, just the introduction of transcatheter heart valves in the US we think actually is a stimulant to surgical heart valves in total. We think it\u2019s going to bring patients into the system, and if our experience in the US is somewhat like our experience in Europe, there\u2019s another reason to believe that the growth rates will be higher in surgicals going forward. There\u2019s also we expect to get INTUITY. That probably adds another, I don\u2019t know what, another 1% to the growth rate as well. So when you put it together, we think we\u2019ve got pretty good reasons to believe that 3-5% is solid. ","Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan","Okay. I know some others want to jump in, but let me ask one quick one on the NCD. And you haven\u2019t had a chance to look at this, I appreciate, so maybe you can just give us the thought, but one item that did kind of catch me that I hadn\u2019t heard of or thought of before was that the requirement for new centers to be considered for TAVR was that the interventionalist had to have experience doing at least 50 structural heart disease procedures prior to this. And, you know, I just don\u2019t know where they would get that experience of doing 50 structural heart procedures unless they\u2019ve been active doing ASDs, VSDs, PFOs. Is that something that you had heard of or surprises you? Because I would assume that that hasn\u2019t been a requirement to date of centers that you\u2019ve been going to.  ","Michael Mussallem ","Yeah, you correctly anticipate that I\u2019m not able to really analyze what they said. No, although there has been conversation right along, Mike, that this should be done by experienced surgeons and experienced cardiologists, and there have been different kind of numbers thrown out, this is the first time that I have heard of a certain number of structural heart procedures. So that is new from our perspective. But the good news is we\u2019re going to have a comment period. We\u2019re going to be able to get into this and really talk about the challenge, potentially, the logic associated with some of the assumptions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Two questions. One, I just wanted to come back to international sales. And this is for SAPIEN, for TAVI, if you take out the US numbers for 4Q, your OUS sales were about $76 million. And to kind of get to the mid to high point of your TAVI forecast worldwide for 2012, it looks like the international number has to do between $90 million and $100 million, in that ballpark. So how do we get from doing somewhere around $75 million in international sales in 4Q \u201911 to getting to $90 million plus per quarter in 2012? That\u2019s my first question. ","Michael Mussallem ","I\u2019m not sure I followed your math perfectly, so I apologize for that Glenn. You know, we do think that even though Europe has grown substantially, and we know that growth rate won\u2019t persist forever. Just a little bit of the law of large numbers. There\u2019s still going to be pretty good growth. We would imagine international growth would be in excess - just the market itself - in excess of 20%. So I don\u2019t know if that ends up solving for what you\u2019re trying to get to, from the $75 million to the $90 million, but we would think the market growth would do that by itself. ","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Well, that\u2019s what I have in my model, but it just, on a sequential basis, as we go from 4Q into 2012, does require a step up. Let me ask you just one other question on the advisory panel. At STS, Dr. Smith said he thought a panel would be April-May. Now, I don\u2019t think he has an edge, but I\u2019m just wondering, is an April or May panel more realistic? In other words, the capital data is going into the FDA, they want to review that data, and it\u2019s for that reason that a panel maybe is a little bit later than expected? ","Michael Mussallem ","I was in the audience as well when Dr. Smith said that. You know, I have no reason to believe that he has any insight information, and I think that was his own estimate. Frankly, we really just don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve been estimating it will be in the first quarter, and for modeling purposes we\u2019ve assumed that we will get the approval for Cohort A in midyear. And so if the panel comes a little early or a little later, really tough for us to be able to estimate it. It\u2019s really up to FDA and the availability of the panel members. So I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t give you much more insight.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Miroslava Minkova from Leerink Swann. Please proceed with your question. ","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann","I appreciate that you don\u2019t have a comment on the national coverage decision, but theoretically, were you expecting that two surgeon [unintelligible] approvals would be required for an inoperable patient? And how would that change your adoption assumption basically? ","Michael Mussallem ","You know, I haven\u2019t seen it, and so if you say that there\u2019s surgeons in there, I\u2019ll take you at your word there. For us, we frankly didn\u2019t know what the FDA label would say. It might have also said two surgeons. We don\u2019t think two surgeons is a big negative for this procedure. We think in general there are two surgeons that are going to be associated with this at all times. That\u2019s what was trained. When we had the PARTNER trial itself, it took two surgeons. So we don\u2019t look at that as a big negative. ","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann","Great, and finally, I know you\u2019ve been asked a lot of questions on Europe, but I think what\u2019s probably still confusing people is the currency is a little bit more negative than at the time you gave guidance. The euro has weakened. And your fourth quarter wasn\u2019t [unintelligible] because of weakness due to macroeconomic conditions. I guess if maybe I could ask what gives you the confidence to maintain the overall TAVR guidance that you\u2019re giving? Or said differently, were you assuming this kind of a tough environment in southern Europe when you did give the guidance last month? ","Michael Mussallem ","If you go back to our investor conference, Miroslava, we actually put a slide up that anticipated sales, and that sales number we actually said the bottom end of our range - and I forget what slide number it was - but we pretty much landed exactly on that number. So we had a pretty good idea of what the climate was by the time we got to our December investor conference. We did not have that same visibility back in October, but in December we were pretty close. Is that fair, Tom? ","Thomas Abate ","Yeah, and the FX got worse by about 20 since that time, and I\u2019d say half of that probably is going to be hitting the THV Europe sales. So within $10 million, you should be close on FX impact. ","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann","So you\u2019re basically assuming that some of these procedures that did not happen should come back, perhaps, as we go into the new budget year? ","Michael Mussallem ","I would say that we are still standing by our guidance for what we have for 2012. So of course it\u2019s going to be a ramp. It\u2019s tough for us to predict, but we think our guidance anticipates some of the natural FX fluctuation as well as some of the uncertainty that\u2019s around when these countries restore procedures.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. ","Bruce Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Mike, on a happy note, the cap data really showed amazingly good neurological outcomes. Do you have any feel yet of what the secret sauce on that was? ","Michael Mussallem ","We don\u2019t is the short answer. I mean, obviously we think it\u2019s a byproduct of experience. So a combination of factors. We think patient selection probably was better. We think operator experience in procedures was better. We think the devices were a little bit better, a little later on in the trial as well. So there\u2019s a combination of factors. It\u2019s tough for us to say which was the most important factor. And we expect to learn more about that in our pro TAVI trial. ","Bruce Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","And I guess a follow up, Mike. We\u2019ve talked about this before. If unit growth in Europe is around 20% now, we thought ex-US unit growth in aggregate was about 30% for the market last quarter. Does that tell you anything about the idea of how many people are really sitting on the sideline? The ability to recruit unreferred patients now? The fact that the market probably at the beginning of the year ex-US was closer to 50%? Any thoughts on that? ","Michael Mussallem ","We continue to believe that there\u2019s a lot of patients that are on the sideline, and it\u2019s probably economic factors that\u2019s the greater issue. When we see a country gain reimbursement, you see the patients in those countries come for the procedure, and we think that\u2019s probably the more significant underlying factor that unlocks the ability of these patients to get treatment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. ","Adam - Citigroup","Hi, this is Adam in for Amit today. I just had a question on rest of world. I know the growth rate there decelerated just as much as Europe, so I was wondering if you could go into a little more detail as to what happened there. ","Michael Mussallem ","In rest of world? I don\u2019t know. Those numbers tend to be smaller. I don\u2019t know if I could pick up a growth rate on that, Adam. Do you have something a little bit more specific? Because what we call rest of world - so again if you take out US, and you take out Europe, the growth in the fourth quarter was very similar to the full year growth. ","Adam - Citigroup","Well, maybe just on any kind of segmentation by product. Was there anything in particular going on there that was different than expectations? ","Michael Mussallem ","Is this Edwards in total that you\u2019re talking about, Adam? ","Adam - Citigroup","Yeah, Edwards in total. ","Michael Mussallem ","Okay. Let me try to look more closely and see if there\u2019s something that I can attribute it to. Yeah, just looking at this quickly, our quarter to date and our year to date growth rates in rest of world are very similar. They look like they\u2019re within about a percent of each other. So it\u2019s not something that\u2019s jumping off the page. So we\u2019re happy to work offline and see if there\u2019s a more detailed understanding we can provide.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Real quick one, and then I\u2019ll have a follow up. I know the cap data on TA was really superb. I was just wondering when might we be able to see the cap data on transfemoral. ","Michael Mussallem ","I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s going to be presented publicly before a panel. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s available. That certainly is being worked up by us, and we would plan to bring that kind of data to the panel if we can possibly do that, but I don\u2019t know that\u2019s going to be in a public forum before then, Kristen. ","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Okay, so it won\u2019t be something at ACC along with the two-year data? ","Michael Mussallem ","I don\u2019t know that it will be ACC. Again, we\u2019ll see what happens. As far as I know, ACC will just have the two-year data that\u2019s particularly within the PMA. ","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and then I know that you have not looked at the NCD, but I was just wondering, in formulating your guidance for transcatheter valves for 2012, I was just wondering what you were thinking about in the context of potential risks to that, specifically in terms of centers having to qualify in certain criteria. Does this really add an element of risk? Because I imagine if I\u2019m a center looking to start up TAVI, and I\u2019m looking at all these criteria, I may just want to wait to see how this shakes out before really making the level of investment and buying the valves and getting all the training up and running. So maybe just talk through how you were thinking about that in terms of maybe applying different haircuts to the guidance. And then also just on the sales, it looks like they\u2019re proposing to restrict coverage to patients with coronary artery disease, which is consistent with PARTNER, but seems to screen out quite a bit of patients if you look at the STS database. ","Michael Mussallem ","Well, you\u2019re ahead of me when it comes to the analysis of what was published, Kristen, so we can\u2019t really comment on that. We can talk about our assumptions. You know, obviously we gave a range, because there\u2019s a range of possibilities. Probably the two biggest factors that are in our assumptions, we\u2019ve assumed that we would train 150 to 250 hospitals, and so there would be a natural ramp that\u2019s associated with that. Obviously that builds upon itself, and so it gets much bigger in the back half of the year. And the other thing that\u2019s in that assumption is an approval for Cohort A in midyear. So if Cohort A were approved earlier or later, that would change the numbers. If there was something within the document that you\u2019re referencing, that causes the 150 to 250 hospital ramp to change significantly, that would also have impact on our range. ","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","So the 150 to 200 you didn\u2019t necessarily expect any formal restrictions in terms of which centers you could go after. That was just your ideal centers? ","Michael Mussallem ","What we\u2019re trying to do is to summarize that we thought we would train 150 to 250 centers. We knew that it wasn\u2019t going to be a center-only kind of criteria laid out by the societies and CMS, that there would be some specific criteria or credentials for physicians into it. And we thought that that would allow 150 to 250 centers. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be analyzing when we get into it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gunderson from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. ","Tom Gunderson - Piper Jaffray","On PARTNER 2, and its impact on your US guidance numbers, if we look at - you\u2019ve already fully enrolled B - so if we look at A and it\u2019s roughly 2000 patients, and it\u2019s a one to one randomization, and you said in your prepared comments that you expect full enrollment in 2013, is the math correct to assume that somewhere around 500 SAPIEN XT patients would be enrolled in 2012 and that\u2019s part of your guidance?  ","Michael Mussallem ","I think that\u2019s a reasonable estimate. Of course, remember there\u2019s also a ramp associated with P2A, but I think that\u2019s a reasonable estimate. ","Tom Gunderson - Piper Jaffray","And then you mentioned to one of the other answers, but I call it the halo effect, where you get more SAVR just because you\u2019re out there talking more and the valve teams etc. Is that a passive increase or do you have specific programs that you\u2019re focusing on to capture as much of the valve market as you can because of the attention that TAVI\u2019s getting? ","Michael Mussallem ","First, historically, it\u2019s been passive. So what we saw in Europe - and I don\u2019t know if you recall the slide that I think Larry presented at the investor conference that talked about the growth of the market both doubled after the introduction of transcatheter heart valves. I think it went from the 3 range to the 6 range. And then in particular, for Edwards, our growth rate stepped up from 5 to one that was more than 10, I think close to 13%. And so that happened in Europe. In the US, we do have some more active processes where we\u2019re helping hospitals establish valve clinics. And this is a cooperative effort between our heart valve team and the transcatheter heart valve team to just help hospitals do a good job of treating aortic stenosis. And so there may be some positive effect, but I would say that the underlying effect is the more predominant one.  ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Nam from ThinkEquity. Please proceed with your question. ","Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity","Just a couple of quick housekeeping questions I guess. First, on this NCD, is there going to be another decision document coming out from CMS in the next couple of months in terms of proposed rates and things like that? Should we expect that? ","Michael Mussallem ","This is the document that we were anticipating. I think they have something that was shown on their website that we anticipated this draft document might come at the end of the fourth quarter. So the fact that we\u2019re getting it on the second of February just moves that up. And then there\u2019s a natural part of this process, which is a 30-day comment period, and then actually the publishing of a formal document. We think that\u2019s going to be the primary output from CMS. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything else that\u2019s going to come out besides that. ","Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity","So your interpretation is that there\u2019s not going to be a specific reimbursement rate related document following this coverage decision criteria? ","Michael Mussallem ","There already has been some determination early on here that we were mapped to some surgical DRGs. But the national coverage determination will actually - not anything that changes that mapping process. ","Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity","And second question is this ACC two year follow up data. Is this just going to be a continuation of the data that we saw last year on Cohort A or is it going to be more select data from that analysis? And should we expect the data to be also included as part of the upcoming panel? ","Michael Mussallem ","No, I think what you\u2019re going to see is that the patients that receive transcatheter heart valves - what was reported in the past was simply their one year data. These are the patients that were randomized in the trial, so that was 699 patients, I think, was the number that was in Cohort A, and then there was the numbers, just like for Cohort B, what we saw at the TCT, this will be what you see for Cohort A. You\u2019ll see two-year data on that group of randomized patients. So for example, within that are the 104 or 103 TA patients, etc. That will all be extended out to two years. Is that clear? Did I answer that?  ","Spencer Nam - ThinkEquity","Yeah. No, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We have run out of time for questions.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Erickson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","David Erickson","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our fourth quarter 2018 financial results. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today\u2019s call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO and Scott Ullem, CFO.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during today\u2019s call we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include but aren\u2019t limited to financial guidance, expectations for product opportunities, commercial trends, clinical trials, litigation, new product approvals, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today.","Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in our press release, our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, all of which are available on our Web site at edwards.com.","Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying and adjusted, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s press release and on our Web site.","Finally, please note that because the SAPIEN 3 low risk data will be presented just six weeks from now, we will not be making any further statements or answering questions about expected results of the trial. Accordingly, we are not updating, withdrawing or supplementing any of our prior statements related to this topic. We would appreciate you respecting our request given the timing.","And now I will turn the call over to Michael Mussallem. Mike?","Mike Mussallem","Thank you, David. We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter total adjusted sales of $983 million or 10% sales growth on an underlying basis, consistent with our expectations, driven by our portfolio of innovative technologies. For the full year 2018, we also reported 10% growth on an underlying basis and over $3.8 billion in sales also in line with our guidance.","Profitability was strong in 2018 with adjusted EPS growing over 20%, even as we continue to invest aggressively in our innovation initiatives and infrastructure. As you heard at our investor conference last month, we are as convinced as ever in the tremendous opportunity to improve patients' lives by addressing deadly conditions and bringing significant value to the healthcare system.","In Transcatheter Heart Valve therapies, global sales for the fourth quarter were $592 million, up 11% on an underlying basis and over 12% for the full year. We estimate global TAVR procedures this quarter continue to grow in the mid-teens. Our worldwide sales grew at a lower rate due to a modest year-over-year share decline as we continue to exercise price discipline and hold global average selling prices stable. We estimate our global competitive position remain stable in the second half of the year. Also late in the quarter, we were pleased to receive approvals for our SAPIEN 3 Ultra system in Europe and the U.S. We believe this therapy will bring significant value to patients and providers.","As highlighted at our investor conference, we believe there are a large number of patients suffering from aortic stenosis who are either undiagnosed or untreated. We're investing in programs to increase awareness, increase diagnosis, improve referral patterns and help patients receive the care they need based on medical guidelines.","In the U.S., total TAVR procedures for the fourth quarter grew in the mid-teens versus the prior year and our growth was comparable. Growth was highest in newer and smaller centers, which are providing access to a broader population of aortic stenosis patients. We continue to enroll the U.S. pivotal trial to study our self-expanding CENTERA valve in intermediate risk patients. We estimate enrollment of this trial will be completed next year.","In the fourth quarter, we continued to enroll our continued access protocol for our U.S. PARTNER 3 trial. A late breaker presentation of the PARTNER 3 trial results is scheduled for the ACC scientific session in March, and our guidance continues to assume receipt of a low-risk indication late this year.","CMS is currently in the process of formulating a draft provision to the National Coverage Determination or NCD, which we expect to be released at the end of March for public comment. We assume any changes to the current NCD are unlikely to significantly affect the global TAVR opportunity. We expect the new NCD to be finalized by the end of June 2019.","Outside the U.S., in the fourth quarter, we estimate TAVR procedures continued to grow in the mid-teens, while Edwards' procedures grew in the low double digits year-over-year. We continue to see excellent long-term opportunities for growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR therapy is still quite low.","In Europe, we estimate that TAVR procedures grew at an impressive mid-teens rate. Growth in countries of lower TAVR adoption rates continue to outpace countries where the therapy is more established. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced some expected share loss. However, our share continued to be stable on a sequential basis. We are continuing to control commercial introduction of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra and CENTERA systems in Europe as we focus on achieving high procedural success rates.","While early, we are receiving positive feedback from clinicians on the unique features offered by both products and the potential of streamlining the procedure and have meaningful impact on patient outcomes. Our plans are to replace SAPIEN 3 with SAPIEN 3 Ultra as the market-leading therapy in Europe.","In Japan, we continued to see strong TAVR adoption, driven by SAPIEN 3 and new centers are being qualified. This is our fastest growing region in the fourth quarter where we believe aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease among the large elderly population. Earlier this month, we reached an agreement with Boston Scientific to settle all outstanding patent litigation. We are pleased with this conclusion that allows us to move forward, dedicating our time and resources to advancing our innovations and helping patients.","In summary, we are encouraged by the continuing strength of our TAVR adoption globally and continue to expect our underlying sales growth for 2019 to be 11% to 15%. We expect our sales growth rate to ramp up, following Q1 as we introduce new products and continue to develop strong clinical evidence supporting this therapy. We are committed to maintaining our leadership in TAVR, which remains a large global opportunity that we estimate will double in size and reach approximately $7 billion by 2024.","Turning to our Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid therapies, or TMTT. We remain enthusiastic about the opportunities to treat the many patients suffering from these deadly heart valve diseases. As we previously outlined, we continued to invest aggressively in our portfolio and plan to achieve significant milestones in 2019. You can expect to hear incremental updates at medical meetings this year and today, I will provide some select updates.","Beginning with transcatheter mitral repair, we've made some progress toward obtaining a CE mark for the Pascal transcatheter valve repair system. In the U.S., clinicians are treating patients in the CLASP IID pivotal trial to study PASCAL in degenerative mitral disease, and we are activating new sites. We continue to expect the initiation of our CLASP IIF pivotal trial for patients with functional mitral disease in late 2019. We were disappointed to learn earlier this week that Abbott is pursuing patent litigation regarding our PASCAL system in the U.S., UK and Germany. PASCAL represents the culmination of 20 years of innovation by Edwards to develop a novel differentiated and more advanced platform for patients in need. The IP landscape for transcatheter mitral therapies is complex and crowded. In fact, Edwards owns an impressive portfolio of intellectual property in this space. We plan to vigorously defend ourselves and are currently evaluating a range of responses.","Patients continue to be treated commercially in Europe with Cardioband. As expected, fourth quarter sales were limited to $1 million due to the ongoing supply constraints. We are continuing to transfer the production of this platform to other Edwards manufacturing facilities in order to fortify our near-term supply and scale for long-term volume expectations. This process remains on track and we continue to expect supply to progressively improve throughout 2019. As this therapy advances, we believe that the annular reduction provided by Cardioband can be an important first-line treatment for many mitral patients.","In mitral replacement, we continue to see significant progress in both of our novel platforms and remain strong believers in our transseptal strategy. We have initiated our U.S. early feasibility study for EVOQUE and are encouraged by the early clinical results. We are also continuing to enroll patients in a U.S. early feasibility study for SAPIEN M3 and plan to initiate a U.S. pivotal trial in late 2019.","In transcatheter tricuspid repair, again, constrained by supply, clinicians continue to treat a limited number of patients in Europe with our Cardioband tricuspid system and we've received positive feedback on this therapy. In the U.S. clinicians are treating patients in our early feasibility study.","In summary, our guidance for total TMTT revenue assumes approximately $40 million for 2019. We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach approximately $3 billion by 2024 and are passionate about bringing these solutions to these deadly diseases and improving patients' lives around the world.","In surgical structural heart, adjusted sales for the fourth quarter of $212 million were up approximately 5.5% on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of the consignment inventory conversion, which is now complete. For the full year, underlying growth in this product line was 3%. Fourth quarter growth was driven by solid aortic unit volume and continued adoption of our newer premium aortic valves. We are continuing to launch our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve in all major regions, and are encouraged by the strong adoption of this new class of resilient tissue valves. This valve is designed to be an attractive option for active patients, and we've observed a trend of physicians treating younger patients with INSPIRIS versus traditional heart valves.","We have begun enrolling our RESILIENT trial, a prospective study to evaluate durability of RESILIA surgical tissue valves in patients under 65. And we remain on track to begin treating patients with our Harpoon system in Europe by midyear 2019. In summary, in surgical structural heart, we continue to expect full-year 2019 underlying sales growth to be 1% to 3%. And even as TAVR adoption expands, we are excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and expand our global leadership in surgical structural heart technologies.","In critical care, sales for the quarter were $178 million and grew 10% on an underlying basis. For the full year, underlying sales grew 11%. This quarter's performance was strong across all of our critical care product categories, led by the healthy demand for HemoSphere and the continued growth of enhanced recovery. Sales in the U.S. continue to be robust this quarter. HemoSphere, our next generation all-in-one monitoring platform that is replacing our existing monitoring system continues to receive excellent feedback from clinicians. This platform is designed to provide greater clarity on a patient's hemodynamic status and enables our artificial intelligence capabilities. This new monitor should continue to be an important growth driver for our critical care product line, although, year-over-year comparisons will become more difficult in 2019.","In the fourth quarter, we are pleased to announce FDA clearance of our Acumen Hypotension Prediction Index software, or HPI, for use on HemoSphere. This platform is expected to be an important growth driver for 2019 and the commercial launch is underway. We continue to collect clinical evidence on this technology, which introduces artificial intelligence to hemodynamic monitoring through a machine learning data-driven algorithm that indicates the likelihood of a hypotensive or low blood pressure event before it occurs. Additionally, we are on track with our assisted fluid management clinical trial in the U.S., which we have also described in our investor conference.","In summary, we continue to expect 2019 underlying sales growth of 5% to 7% as comparisons become more difficult throughout the year. We remain excited about our pipeline to innovate critical care products and look forward to continuing our global rollout of HemoSphere.","And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Ullem","Thank you, Mike. I'm pleased to report that our strong finish to the year enable us to broadly meet or exceed our guidance for 2018. Today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2018, including detailed results from the fourth quarter, as well as provide guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2019.","For the full year 2018, adjusted sales increased 10% on an underlying basis to $3.8 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 24% to $4.70, and we generated $786 million of adjusted free cash flow. We are also pleased to invest in growth initiatives even more than originally planned in 2018 due to the benefit of U.S. tax reform that reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 400 basis points. We utilized the savings of over $40 million to hire new employees, accelerate research and development initiatives and contribute more to employee retirement accounts, while also growing earnings. And after recognizing the new tax on unrepatriated earnings, we were able to utilize cash formally trapped outside the U.S. to fund the growth investments, expansion of our facilities and share repurchases to offset dilution from stock option exercises. Unfortunately, the suspension of the medical device excise tax is scheduled to expire at the end of 2019. And if it is not repealed, it will largely consume the savings from tax reform.","Consistent with prior quarters this year, adjusted sales excluded sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for surgical valves in the U.S., which was $5 million in the fourth quarter. As planned, we completed the conversion process in 2018 with a full year negative impact to reported sales of $83 million. Adjusted sales in the fourth quarter grew 10% on an underlying basis, and adjusted earnings per share grew 24% to $1.17 versus the prior year.","GAAP earnings per share was $0.03, which included several one-time adjustments, primarily a non-cash charge of $116 million, or $0.52 per share related to the impairment of Cardioband intangible assets that I discussed at last month's investor conference; and a $180 million charge, or $0.65 per share related to the previously announced settlement of the patent disputes. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.","I'll now cover the details of our results and then discuss guidance for 2019. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.1% compared to 73.8% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven by favorable foreign exchange, the benefit of a more profitable product mix and the absence of last year's expenses associated with the closure of our manufacturing plant in Switzerland. These benefits were partially offset by continued investments in manufacturing capacity.","We continue to expect our 2019 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%. Our rate should be lifted primarily by foreign exchange along with an improved product mix, tempered by capacity investments.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $288 million or 29% of sales, compared to $273 million in the prior year. This increase was driven primarily by TAVR therapy adoption initiatives, partially offset by lower reported expenses outside the United States due to the stronger U.S. dollar. We continue to expect SG&A excluding special items to be between 28% and 29% of sales for the full year 2019, which includes the continued suspension of the medical device excise tax until the end of this year.","Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 11% to $163 million or 16.7% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs, including spending on clinical trials. For the full year 2019, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be between 17% and 18% as we invest in clinical trials to expand indications and develop new technologies.","Regarding taxes, we recorded a tax benefit to earnings this quarter due to deductions, resulting from our litigation settlement and intangible asset impairment. Excluding the impact of these and other special items, our tax rate this quarter would have been 17.2%. This rate includes an approximate 200 basis point benefit from the accounting for employee stock-based compensation consistent with our guidance. Our full year tax rate in 2018, excluding special items, was 13.4% and we continue to expect our full year rate in 2019 to be between 12% and 14%.","Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter sales growth by 1.6% or $14 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $60 million negative impact or about 1.5% to full year 2019 sales compared to 2018. FX rates positively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our October guidance, FX rates positively impacted earnings per share by about a penny, reflecting our effective currency hedging program.","Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $235 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $293 million less capital spending of $58 million. For the full year 2018, adjusted free cash flow was $786 million.","Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $956 million. Total debt was $594 million. We repurchased 1.8 million shares during the quarter for $272 million, including the $250 million accelerated share repurchase we announced at the December Investor Conference, as well as additional shares repurchased through a 10B5 program. As a result of these repurchases, average shares outstanding during the quarter declined to $212 million. It is notable that in the past two years, we have reduced fully diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2.6% or 6 million shares. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2019 to be between $211 million and $213 million.","Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with guidance for 2019. Our full year sales guidance ranges communicated at the investor conference last month remain unchanged; for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, we continue to expect a range of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion; for surgical structural heart, $810 million to $850 million; for critical care, $670 million to $710 million; and for TMTT, sales of approximately $40 million. For Total Edwards, we expect sales in 2019 of $3.9 billion to $4.3 billion.","For the full year 2019, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $5.05 to $5.30 and free cash flow, excluding special items of $800 million to $900 million. For the first quarter of 2019, we project total sales to be between $950 million and $1.01 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.25.","And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.","Mike Mussallem","Thanks, Scott. Our strong 2018 performance reinforces our confidence in our focused innovation strategy and our longer term outlook, and we anticipate an exciting 2019 as we pursue important therapies that will benefit many more patients. We look forward to launching a number of new technologies, as well as achieving meaningful milestones across our product lines. We are confident that our differentiated strategy and focus on leadership will continue to create value and benefit the patients we serve.","With that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David Erickson","Thank you, Mike. Before we open up for questions, please note that Edwards is planning to host an analyst meeting at ACC on Sunday, March 17th. This meeting will be webcast for those who cannot attend in person. More information will be available in the coming weeks.","We are ready to questions now. In order to allow broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and we'll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the call.","Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Hopkins","Just wanted to start out with a pipeline question related to mitral and then I had a follow-up on the first quarter guidance that you're providing. To start with the pipeline question, on mitral valve repair, I'm just curious on PASCAL. Will we see some European PASCAL data at ACC or PCR? Just give us a sense of when we will see some PASCAL data and what exactly we will see?","Mike Mussallem","No, we are not expecting any data from PASCAL at ACC. We would expect to see PASCAL data later in the year at PCR. There is a German meeting called DGK, which might also share some PASCAL data, so that might be the first time that you see some of that CE Mark data.","Bob Hopkins","And so expecting midyear approval?","Mike Mussallem","That\u2019s correct.","Bob Hopkins","And then on the first quarter, either for Mike or for Scott, I'm sure the recent questions on the earnings side, given it is below where the consensus is. But I wanted to ask about on the top line. The numbers you gave us. Can you give us a sense what growth rate that assumes? And I know at the analyst day you said growth would be lower in the first quarter. But maybe if you could just walk us through the revenue guidance to start, especially in light of the fact that you're launching new TAVR launches. I would expect those you could start to see some, perhaps some acceleration in TAVR growth in the first quarter, because of those launches. So I just wanted to ask a little bit about the Q1 revenue growth guide.","Scott Ullem","So let me just take through the full year underlying growth rate guidance, which for total Edwards is 9% to 12%; TAVR 11% to 15%; for TMTT, we're starting from a really small base call it several million dollars in 2018. So the growth rate is not meaningful, but we're targeting around $40 million in revenues for 2019; surgical structural heart 1% to 3% underlying growth and critical care 5% to 7%. So to your question about TAVR in the first quarter, we're going to continue to grow, but a lot of the growth drivers in TAVR hit after the first quarter, such as the new products that Mike talked about and the clinical evidence that we are going to be continuing to develop during 2019. For TMTT similarly, we'll start to see new products being recorded at the sales line as we get later into 2019, and as we start seeing some of the supply constraints continue to alleviate that have been affecting Cardioband.","In critical care, now we probably came out of the fourth quarter stronger than we expected. And that may accrue to our benefit in the first quarter. But overall, you should expect that first quarter sales and underlying growth year-over-year for Edwards will be lower than the rest of the year. In fact, it might be lower than the bottom end of that 9% to 12% range. This is something we highlighted at the Investor Conference last month. We mentioned it again at the JPMorgan Conference earlier this month. But overall, we're really positive on a very successful growth here in 2019.","Mike Mussallem","And I'll just add Bob, particularly on the TAVR numbers. Rather than us trying to score a touchdown in the first quarter, we're executing a playbook where we very carefully try and rollout these technologies, because the SAPIEN 3 safety has such a strong track record clinically that we really feel like we want to have an outstanding launch of the Ultra valve and CENTERA. They are different. They behave different in the hands of clinicians. And we're being very thoughtful about that.","Bob Hopkins","But no changes since the Analyst Day really, there is nothing changing in the guidance as it relates to Q1 or how the year is developing.","Scott Ullem","No changes in the guidance for the year since the Analyst Day last month, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Isaac Ro","First question is on the Commercial Org. Just hoping, Scott, if you could maybe help qualify the investments that you're making in the commercial organization ahead of the low risk indication that you guys expect later this year. And the reason I ask you is I'm just thinking about how any incremental spending will ramp over the course of the year assuming the date is good at ACC.","Scott Ullem","So we've been investing in the commercial organization, both in Europe and in the U.S. to support growth in TMTT and TAVR, in particular and we're going to continue to do that. But you shouldn't expect that it's going to be a big stair step just because we've been doing this on orderly fashion overtime. In the fourth quarter, SG&A as a percentage of sales of was 29.3%, which is little bit higher than our full year guidance, but SG&A expense is only grew about 6%.","So expect that we're going to be continuing to grow at that rate that we talked about at the Investor Conference, 28% to 29%. The other thing that we're doing on the SG&A line is continuing to divest in therapy development initiatives, and making sure that we are making patients and physicians, clinicians aware of therapeutic alternatives. And so we're investing more aggressively going forward than we have in the past.","Isaac Ro","And then just to follow, on Europe. Appreciated your comments regarding the hand off that you expect from S3 over Ultra and CENTERA. I'm kind of curious how quickly you expect that to play out this year. And what that means for ASPs in TAVR into region or maybe globally? Thank you.","Mike Mussallem","I mean ultimately we expect the ultra valve to replace SAPIEN 3. We haven\u2019t put ourselves on a strict timetable. What we were putting a premium on is to have outstanding results. But we would like to move that right along. I expect the bulk of the volume to certainly moving Europe by the end of the year, but we don\u2019t have a firm number there. Isaac, this is really more or less driven by our ability to execute at an extremely high level. In terms of ASP, we would expect -- if you go really big picture that we would see some modest ASP declines that\u2019s associated with volume discounts. But other than that, we are very disciplined pricers, so we don\u2019t expect this to be much different.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","David Lewis","I'll just start with Scott, and then I have a follow up after that. Scott, at Analyst Day, you suggested there were some allotments that were made for the Boston legal dynamics, and now I'm thinking about '19. Ultra can come to Germany. There is no UK injunction coming up in May. So what impact now does that have on guidance?","Scott Ullem","I think it probably doesn\u2019t -- it doesn\u2019t change our guidance specifically. It might de-risk some of the guidance and sales that we provided for TAVR. But it doesn\u2019t fundamentally change our guidance at all, David.","David Lewis","Mike, just two questions for you, the first is just you talked about at Analyst Day modest share loss in the U.S. and stability ex-U.S. And given the learnings that you have from CENTERA and Ultra in the fourth quarter, I wonder if you can just comment on how you are feeling about those expectations here end of January based on the fourth quarter knowledge? And then just a follow up on Bob's question. Do you still intend to launch PASCAL mid '19 if you don't have an injunction?","Mike Mussallem","First of all on your first question, no our assumptions really have not changed since our investor conference. We continue to get positive reinforcement from our clinicians on what they have seen of Ultra and CENTERA. Although, we would admit that this is still early feedback and so we are proceeding there. So nothing that's really changed that. And then your second question was about what we expect for launch. We expect the European launch by mid-2019, and really haven't changed anything in that regard.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Larry Biegelsen","One strategic question for you, Mike. One guidance question for you, Scott. So Mike you recently hired a new Chief Scientific Officer who is very well-regarded in the cardiovascular space, but I believe his focus is outside of structural heart disease. So what's his mandate going to be at Edwards? And should we expect to see any change in the company's focus or will you remain hyper focused in structural heart? And I'll just throw in the second question for Scott. The follow up to Bob's earlier question on Q1 EPS, I think at the midpoint, it's down year-over-year. So can you help us understand why that might be?","Mike Mussallem","So we are very pleased that Dr. Todd Britten is running our organization as a Chief Scientific Officer. He has got a tremendous background as both an engineer and a physician. And we think he is going to bring a lot to our company. The short answer is no, absolutely nothing is changing in terms of our hyper focus of our strategy. We are going to remain totally focused on structural heart disease and critical care technologies. Todd brings with him a lot of expertise and we expect him to just help us even be more successful in the future than we have been in the past.","Scott Ullem","And Larry on the EPS for 2019. If I were to look down at my risk band playbook, I'd say we're going to continue to invest aggressively in some of our growth initiatives that hit the R&D line and the SG&A line. And the sales growth as I mentioned before, it doesn't kick in earnest until post the first quarter. So you're right. First quarter EPS estimates at the midpoint would lag Q1 of 2018 and that's the reason.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay Kumar","Maybe one on TAVR just focusing on 4Q. Mike, it looks like U.S. was stable during Q-on-Q, maybe international was a little bit softer. How much of this is just maybe the market softening a little bit? Because I think Medtronic was commenting what maybe -- the overall market maybe softening a little bit. And I think I saw something of our shares being stable. So maybe can you talk about shares Q-on-Q and what happened to market growth?","Mike Mussallem","I can give you an estimate of what's going on. So, we still think that the overall global market is growing in the mid-teens. And we think the U.S. and OUS actually are at very similar levels of growth there. Is it possible that the market grew a little bit less in the fourth quarter? It could have. It gets very difficult, especially the last two weeks of December to be very accurate in terms of estimating this just one implant for account for that dramatic impact on results. And so very difficult, I wouldn't take that as a big signal. In terms of the competitive positioning, we think that's been quite stable overall on a sequential basis, both inside and outside the U.S.","Vijay Kumar","And then maybe one for Scott. Scott, it looks like the FX benefit gross margins in the Q. And it looks like the benefit for Q1 should be higher just given how the hedges impact the gross margin line. I'm having a hard time on the EPS one. Is there anything on the R&D line, which is you may have a big step up in Q1. So maybe just help us understand the Q1 dynamics?","Scott Ullem","Well, let me start with your first question on the fourth quarter and just take you through the impact of FX if you look down the P&L; sales, we mentioned before 1.6% lighter due to a strengthening dollar; gross profit margin benefitted by over 100 basis points in Q4; R&D came down a little bit; and SG&A was little bit lower again as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. And earnings in Q4 benefitted to the tune of about $0.03. If you roll forward to fiscal 2019, we were expecting a $90 million headwind in sales last month at the investor conference. At current rates, that looks more like $60 million of the headwind.","And you're right in terms of gross profit benefit from FX it's probably closer to couple of hundred basis points in the full year 2019. And that should help our EPS a little bit as well when you go down to the bottom line. Although again it's at current rates and those move around at a one factor EPS forecast as we get into the year.","Vijay Kumar","And just anything on the R&D line? I think gross margin sequentially, I'm having a hard time I guess coming into the EPS for Q1.","Scott Ullem","So R&D will come down a little bit and SG&A will come down a little bit. Again, as a result of FX, most of those expenses in R&D hit us in the U.S. There is relatively little in R&D that we realized from outside of the United States.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Mills","Scott, I would like to start with you. And I apologize in advance for the question, because I wanted to set it up. As you look at your P&L over the last three years, including the guidance for 2018. You have spent about the same percentage on SG&A the last two years, and you plan to spend similarly this year. You are growing your R&D and you are also growing your top line and your gross margin line. And so that's been the primary contributor along with tax rate improvements and share buybacks to drive a faster earnings growth line. I just like you to maybe get a peak under the covers with respect to how conceptually you are thinking about your P&L as a company, and specifically the middle of the P&L leverage that you might or might not still have. As you look forward, understanding you have only given us one year forward guidance. But just conceptually, whether or not we as outsiders should expect or model as we model longer-term to see leverage in the middle of the P&L?","Mike Mussallem","Scott, why don\u2019t I answer the first part of this and then toss you the football. First of all, our focus is on top line growth. And given the value of the innovations from Edwards, we really feel like the investments that we make to drive that top line, we get a very good return on. And Scott, why don\u2019t you comment on how you feel the rest of the P&L should be viewed?","Scott Ullem","I mean, we have been -- as you mentioned, Jason, we've been investing aggressively in R&D and SG&A to help support organic top line growth, which is our number one financial priority. We still have been able to drive bottom line growth. And in 2018, most of that bottom line growth was supported from tax legislation, because our expenses have been growing even higher than the top end -- than the top line for a while. Overtime though, longer term, we are expecting that R&D as a percentage of sales should come down. We are expecting the top line to grow faster than expenses.","Now it's not a direct line down, because the clinical trial expenses are lumpy. And as trials ramping up we get more R&D that hits the income statement, as it rolls off then we get a little bit of benefit to the income statement. But overtime you should see R&D as a percentage of sales to come down from that 17% to 18% level that we are expecting this year. SG&A as a percentage of sales 28% to 29%, we are running at a level that we think is sustainable. And while we would like to get some better utilization and efficiencies on our backend and administrative expenses, we think we are investing the right level in the field that we are going to continue to invest with physician facing resources as business continues to grow.","Net all of that out, we are expecting that we should get some lift in operating margin and some lift in EPS. It will grow faster than the top line. In 2019, or 2018 rather, we got a little bit of pickup in operating margin. We finished 2017 at about 30% operating margin as a percentage of sales, which is about 30.3% in 2018, so a little bit left as we have guided. And our desire is to continue to do that. If we wanted to really turbo-charge earnings, we could do it easily if we cut into R&D and SG&A. But our plan again and our priority is to continue to invest to grow top line over the long-term.","Jason Mills","And then Mike a much more brief question for you. Maybe you've been asked this several times I'm sure since TCT with COAPT. Have you seen any demonstrable changes in the pace of screening or the level of interest in any form that you might be willing to talk about as it relates to the repair or replacement trials that either you are conducting and you're conducting the most that I know of? Or in any of the other trials other companies do? And just generally speaking pace of the screening enrollment interest level?","Mike Mussallem","There is nothing there that's obvious, Jason. And just big picture, it does not change our strategy. It just reinforces our confidence as we have been before. We're very committed to developing this portfolio of these innovative therapies for people that need mitral and tricuspid treatment. We were big believers before that happened and we'll continue to be believers now. I think that's an inevitable that more patients are going to be treated as we have really safe and effective therapies.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Joanne Wuensch","Most of our focus remains on the U.S., Europe and Japan, but there is a world out there. Could you give us an update on plans into other geographies?","Mike Mussallem","I mean, in particular I assume you're talking about TAVR?","Joanne Wuensch","Yes please?","Mike Mussallem","So TAVR is dramatically undertreated in so many places around the world. And we're continuing to have a lot of impact in places that go beyond Europe, the U.S. and Japan. I mean, obviously, a clear important target would be China. And although, we're not near the end zone on that that one that is one that we are actively pursuing. It's been a complex process there and we don't expect to have anything really accomplished of substance in 2019, but it's a priority for us and we think another potential growth engine in the future.","Joanne Wuensch","My second question has to -- back to mitral data. It sounds like there will be some PASCAL data at PCR, but what other data that you're looking for this year, whether ACC, PCR or some other venue?","Mike Mussallem","Well, that's a difficult one for me. Of course, we expect there to be PASCAL data, particularly the CE Mark data that will become available later on this year. But I would expect at medical meetings, you know that clinicians are engaged in this, they're very anxious to be able to share what they have. And so they're going to be sharing even EFS data when they get a chance and that's collected. Maybe the most meaningful data that will be available later this year will be some of the pivotal data from CLASP IID, these are the degenerative patients. There will be study with PASCAL. So that would be one that you might look for later in the year that would have some substance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Miksic","So I appreciate the color Mike on the U.S. OUS trends, and I think that's something that folks have some difficulty to parsing given the worldwide TAVR numbers that you folks are reporting now. And just if you could provide any color as to what are some of the dynamics affecting Europe, and something in a bit more of detail maybe regionally. And then what are some of the things that are enabling you to stay with the market hold share, defense share, if you will, in the U.S.? And I have one follow-up.","Mike Mussallem","A little different in Europe than it is in some other markets rather than the regulatory process being an important catalyst, the reimbursement process is quite important. And as I tried to indicate in our prepared remarks, what we are seeing are those countries that have been slower adopters traditionally and have a lower penetration rate in terms of TAVRs per million, population for example, are growing faster. We are watching that happen across the board. Whereas those that were early adopters aren\u2019t growing quite as fast.","So maybe that helps give you a sense for some of the color that\u2019s going on. The thing that we feel really good about is overall here is the market that\u2019s still growing in the mid-teens after all these years. I mean TAVR was introduced in 2007. Not many technologies are still growing at that rate and tells you about how much this therapy has continued to improve and how much opportunity there is for continued adoption. Many of these countries are just playing low in terms of their adoption rates today. Although, it's painful to watch how slow medicine changes sometime, I guess the upside to that is there is still a lot of opportunity ahead.","Matt Miksic","And just if I could clarify something, when you talk about the faster growing later adopters, I mean we talked to doctors in centers in some of these countries. And there is a budgetary consideration when considering which one of the platforms they are going to use, or use more or use less. And is that I guess in those geographies present bit more of a challenge in terms of capturing the same share that you might have in the earlier adopting like central European countries? And then I do have just one follow-up on the product launch, if I could.","Mike Mussallem","No Matt, you are right, that\u2019s very much the case. There are people that just have such economic constraints that they feel like it has to drive their clinical condition. We strive very much to make sure that we try and maintain price discipline, so that our good customers aren\u2019t disadvantaged versus those that just don\u2019t have the ability to pay. And it\u2019s a consequence of where we are. But overall, I'm very pleased with our leadership position in this therapy. And we are hopeful that as things improve in these countries economically and as the cost of TAVR continues to come down that it's more and more accessible.","Matt Miksic","And then on the product launch, just Ultra in particular. I guess, there's been a couple of periods over the past couple of years where your commentary heading into the year would include something like, we expect to potentially lose some share to Medtronic product launch that you might be facing, say in the U.S. So this is maybe the first time in a couple years that you really got a significant upgrade to the safety and platform, not to push you too far out over your skies. But is there some potential here that this is something that could be a little bit of a tailwind for you compared to where you might have been playing defense say two three years ago?","Mike Mussallem","Matt, are you talking about global, U.S. or OUS?","Matt Miksic","In the U.S., in particular\u2026","Mike Mussallem","Well, in the U.S., we tried to be clear here. Nothing has really changed in terms of our assumptions. There's only been two competitors and we expect to have a third midyear. And we expect that to have a modest impact on our share. And even though we're very excited about rolling out Ultra, we think that's inevitable. At the same time, there is more and more evidence that's going to be presented. So we think that the TAVR market is going to continue to grow, so there is every opportunity for us to grow nicely as well.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Rick Wise","I'd like to go back to Cardioband. It sounds like much as you said at the Analyst Day and as said recently. The gradual process of improving supply transferring at the other Edwards facility is on track, I hear you. Maybe if you could just drill down a little more. Is this going to be readibly resolved as the year unfolds? Or no, it's really going to take you the second half? Maybe just help us understand where you are in the process? And maybe just a part of that for Scott, when we think about the $40 million. Scott, is this half and half Cardioband, half PASCAL with the launch in Europe and the trials getting underway? How do we think about that breakdown?","Mike Mussallem","It's a priority for us to improve Cardioband. But no, our plans are really unchanged, our expectations are unchanged. We think it's going to be a gradual improvement in the supply situation during the course of the year. We have some pretty good confidence by the end of the year that we're going to have this transferred and have this in pretty good shape, but it's going to take us some time. So I think you should anticipate a ramp.","Scott Ullem","And I'd just add to that. Our plan is and our expectation is that PASCAL will probably be a larger contributor to that $40 million than Cardioband in 2019. I'll also mention since you raised it. We're spending a lot of money in facilities and in our operations and getting or local supply chain positioned to support growth from all of our business units. And so our guidance for 2018 was that we'd have CapEx maybe $250 million, we'll probably come in a little bit less than that, but going in 2019 to about $350 million. So you've seen our announcements about continuing to build out our facility in Costa Rica, our new brownfield facility in Ireland. We're planning to break around our greenfield facility in Ireland, as well as we continue to add capacity in the U.S. and other locations around the world. And so these are all investments that support, not just the transfer of Cardioband supply chain capacity but other products that we're bringing to market as well.","Rick Wise","And just as a follow up, maybe turning back to the IP discussion, I mean clearly, Edwards has a huge portfolio of IP. And I feel like the back and forth litigation is very similar to other periods of med device innovation I've seen over the years. And Mike, this might be really dumb question, but just curious to hear your thinking. Is there any silver lining here as these get more [indiscernible] [resolved]. But clearly it's great that the Boston is settled and behind you. But does this increase the mode around the major players who are really committed like you are to R&D and innovation and IP? I mean I don't know. I'm just -- maybe you have a better answer that\u2019s why I'm asking. Thanks a lot.","Mike Mussallem","I'm not positive exactly where you're going with that question, Rick. Bigger picture, for sure, these patients need innovation. They have some pretty terrible outcomes right now and they really don't have rate solutions with a catheter-based approach. If we could deliver things to them that are really safe and effective that\u2019s great. And actually at competitive environment with a number of options, probably not a bad thing from a patient perspective. We're disappointed that Abbott chose to initiate patent litigation and we are obviously thinking deeply about that. But we think the best solution is not really to be in a fight even though we are going to aggressively defend ourselves. We think our competitive environment is the best situation for everybody.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Raj Denhoy","What if maybe I could follow a bit on the commentary around Europe and the pricing pressure you might be seeing there? I know it's relatively constrained that it's been for several quarters now. But anything more you can offer in terms of where that is and what's driving it? Is it still just a few very isolated centers, are you seeing more broadly just really anything would be helpful?","Mike Mussallem","I don\u2019t know that I have great details to add to that Raj. I would I say in general, we see it broadly rather than in a focused way. We see a pretty consistent premium. We feel like we pretty consistently have a substantial premium versus our competitors. Of course, people go to the large-volume centers and would do some of most aggressive bidding. But generally, I would say it's broad. And we just have chosen with SAPIEN 3 not to go down that road. We have a lot of confidence in our product. We think it's highly differentiated in terms of its performance, and we've been disciplined in our pricing.","Raj Denhoy","Well, it\u2019s a little difficult to parse out from the results you are giving us now. But in terms of the share loss, I mean how much share do you think you may have lost in Europe at this point?","Mike Mussallem","Well, again, what we tried to indicate here is sequentially, probably the second half of the year has been at least by our customer estimates that it's been pretty flat. If you go from a full year perspective, it's probably 1 to 2 point something in that range.","Raj Denhoy","So it doesn\u2019t seem like its getting any worse relatively?","Mike Mussallem","No, I mean the matter of fact the opposite. We think it's been pretty stable here for the last couple of quarters.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Robbie Marcus","People have asked this a couple of different ways. I mean, I'll try a different one. If I think back to the conversion of XT and then SAPIEN 3 it went very rapidly. So maybe you could just help us understand a little bit better why the hesitation to rollout the new products in Europe on a more aggressive basis?","Mike Mussallem","It's actually not as complicated as you might think. SAPIEN was a great product. When SAPIEN XT came along, it was significantly better. It was a giant step we went fast. When SAPIEN 3 came along, it was a giant improvement it went very quickly. SAPIEN 3 has such stellar performance. And the SAPIEN Ultra valve, for example, is just different. It's got a different sheet. It's got different ways that the valve is delivered. And we just want to be very careful about that. When the performance is good as SAPIEN 3 is, we can't tolerate one mistake out of a 100 cases. We really need this to be virtually flawless. And that's what's driving our caution and our care to make sure that we get this just right.","Robbie Marcus","And just last year on the surgical structural heart. As we're looking at a big ramp in catheter growth over the course of 2019. How should we think about the cadence here? And maybe if you could help us understand what percentage of that business is exposed to aortic surgical valves?","Mike Mussallem","At this point, the bulk of our business is aortic still in the surgical heart valve business. And so there is more than half of it that's exposed, if you will. Now, as we've been introducing our new premium products, those are probably consuming maybe not quite a quarter, but a significant portion of the volume as well. And so we expect the growth of those, particularly INSPIRIS, which is enjoying a lot of success, to be able to success to offset with some of what we think is going to be natural cannibalization that comes from TAVR.","Robbie Marcus","And any way to help us to understand maybe on a volume basis the more you move into low risk. What the assumptions are around cannibalization, and how we think about that through the balance of the year?","Mike Mussallem","Well, I mean we think about that when we provide our guidance. And so we thought about that in advance. So we give the guidance of 1% to 3%. You noticed it's lower than the growth rate this year. Part of that is anticipating continued progress and particular progress on the low-risk patients that's going to begin probably during 2019. So no really it's anticipated in our guidance and we really haven't seen anything that changes our view at this early date.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Jennings","Just wanted to start with -- Mike, you and your team talked a bit about the asymptomatic patient population and the opportunity there. And I'm just wondering how you see it playing out post low-risk data? Do you feel like physicians will be more aggressive in terms of trying to listening symptoms or even stress some of these patients? Or do you think we're going to need to wait for early TAVR data for that asymptomatic patient population to begin to be penetrated? And I just have one follow up.","Mike Mussallem","As you know, we're very excited about early TAVR but it's going to take us a while till we see that. It's continuing to enroll nicely. I'd like to think the TAVR continues to stay popular with the spotlights provided by additional evidence we'll maybe stimulate that enrollment some. But it's early to tell. But we're making steady progress. And we're really looking forward to getting results with that trial, because we believe that's an underserved population.","Josh Jennings","And just a follow on that last answer. Just within the presentation at the Investor Day and this year's outlook on the asymptomatic patient population. Do you think there is a segment of asymptomatic patients that just need to have their symptoms elicited and how big could that be?","Mike Mussallem","It's a significant issue. We just think it's complicated for the healthcare system to both diagnose the aortic stenosis itself and symptoms, and to attribute the symptoms to aortic stenosis rather than attributing it to some valves. And that complexity leads the confusion and ultimately leads to patients not being treated. And we think it is a real problem. And we're spending a lot of time thinking about what we can do to improve it. One of the single most important thing we can do is to demonstrate it through the early TAVR trial that there is the big issue. But this is not uncommon. We find in a lot of our own personal experience is to define these situations where people with symptoms just the symptoms are not recognized.","Josh Jennings","And then just my follow-up was just on manufacturing planned build out in Costa Rica and Ireland. Are there plans to transfer the PASCAL manufacturing into one of those facilities?","Mike Mussallem","Those build outs are going really well. We just don\u2019t comment on where we manufacture products. But thanks for that question.","And so with that, thanks for all the continued interest in Edwards. And Scott, David and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. And with that, back to you David.","David Erickson","Thank you for joining us on today's call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to David K. Erickson, Vice President-Investor Relations. Thank you. Please begin.","David K. Erickson - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our fourth quarter 2016 financial results.","During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Scott Ullem, CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and current expectations for new product approvals and clinical, regulatory, reimbursement and competitive matters, as well as trends in therapy adoption and foreign currency movements.

Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release and on our website.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thank you, David. We're pleased to report strong fourth quarter results, which contributed to another successful year for Edwards, as we strengthened our financial performance and product leadership across our portfolio. Robust demand for TAVR therapy continued through the end of the year and better than we forecasted at our December 2016 Investor Conference.","We ended the quarter with total sales of $768 million, an increase of 15% on an underlying basis, and finished the year strong with global sales of nearly $3 billion, representing an underlying annual growth rate of 19%. And I'm proud to report we invested aggressively to bring new medical technologies to more patients and drive future growth.","In Transcatheter Heart Valves, global sales were $432 million, up 32% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Growth was led by continued strong adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the U.S. and Japan. Globally, average selling prices were stable.","In the U.S., Transcatheter Heart Valves sales for the quarter were $267 million and grew 41% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Once again, overall performance was strong with procedures growing broadly across more than 500 hospitals in both large and small TAVR programs. The growth continues to be driven by the extraordinary patient outcomes with SAPIEN 3 reported from the PARTNER II trial earlier in 2016.","Outside the U.S., underlying THV sales grew 19%. We continue to be encouraged by the strong global adoption of TAVR therapy, particularly outside of Europe, where overall therapy penetration is still very low.","In Europe, consistent with previous quarters, growth in countries with lower TAVR adoption continued to outpace countries where therapy is more established. We estimate total TAVR procedure growth in Europe was approximately 15% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Our growth rate was lower, as anticipated, due to the impact of lower sales in France.","As a remainder, we significantly reduced shipments in the third and fourth quarter, while we were negotiating a resolution to the French policy that effectively limited the number of TAVR procedures in 2016. Although the policy was adjusted and we resumed shipments, we estimate fourth quarter sales would have been about $10 million higher absent this interruption.","Turning to our near-term product pipeline, we continue to expect that our new Ultra system, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, will be launched in Europe in the second half of 2017. And we remain on track to receive a CE Mark for our CENTERA system in the second half of 2017.","As we discussed at our Investor Conference in December, we continue to believe the global TAVR opportunity will exceed $5 billion by 2021 for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. We believe the prevalence of this disease is large, generating an even greater need for TAVR therapy.","Additionally, we believe TAVR will benefit the many patients suffering from severe AS, who have not yet been diagnosed with symptoms as well as moderate AS patient populations, representing an opportunity for continued growth beyond 2021. We are continuing to enroll our PARTNER III low-risk trial with the goal to have this randomized trial fully enrolled this year.","As we announced today, we received FDA approval for EARLY-TAVR, our groundbreaking trial that will study patients diagnosed with severe AS who have not yet developed symptoms. Approximately 1,000 patients across 65 centers will be randomized to receive either transfemoral SAPIEN 3 or clinical surveillance. We're beginning the contracting process with hospitals and expect them to begin enrolling later this year.","In summary, while we exited 2016 higher than we forecasted in December, our 2017 THV sales guidance remains unchanged and we expect to achieve 15% to 20% underlying growth. As expected, this represents a slower THV growth rate compared to 2016 and is consistent with our estimate of more than $5 billion TAVR opportunity by 2021.","Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, sales for the fourth quarter were $189 million and were down about 4% compared to last year, driven by lower aortic valve sales in the U.S. and Europe. Surgical Heart Valve sales were lower primarily due to the impact of SAPIEN 3 and the continued constrained mitral supply.","Globally, our average selling prices were slightly higher due to the growth of our advanced EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system. Looking forward, we believe the launches of our new surgical therapies will offset the TAVR impact in 2017. This includes our EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system which is launched in multiple geographies globally and is currently expanding to additional commercial centers in the U.S. with growing momentum.","We also plan to launch our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve in Europe and the U.S. later this year. This is a first of a newly created class of resilient heart valves that incorporates the advanced RESILIA tissue. This valve leverages features of the trusted PERIMOUNT family and includes the proprietary VFit technology, which is designed for potential future valve-in-valve procedures. We believe INSPIRIS addresses the specific needs of active patients and those who would have previously received a mechanical valve.","In summary, Surgical Heart Valve results were below expectations in 2016. However, we believe the introduction of our next-generation platforms to lift overall underlying sales growth to 1% to 3% in 2017.","In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $146 million and grew 3% on an underlying basis. Our growth was driven by our Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program in the U.S. and developing markets. As we announced at our Investor Conference, during the quarter, we received a CE Mark for our next-generation advanced monitoring platform, HemoSphere. This all-in-one system will provide greater clarity on a patient's hemodynamic status to enable clinicians to make timely, potentially lifesaving decisions.","We anticipate a U.S. regulatory clearance later this year, and a commercial rollout of the base platform. HemoSphere is modular in design and we will later add Enhanced Surgical Recovery capabilities in the future.","And, we remain on track for a 2017 European launch of our Acumen HPI software suite with our new FloTrac IQ Smart Disposable. This is a first of a kind hypotension or low blood pressure probability indicator during monitoring. In 2017, we continue to expect our Critical Care underlying sales growth to be between 5% and 7%.","Now, for an update on several of our new transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies. Last week, we were pleased to announce that we completed the acquisition of Valtech Cardio, the developer of the Cardioband System for transcatheter repair of mitral and tricuspid valves. We're in the process of welcoming and integrating this talented team to Edwards. Our 2017 financial guidance provided at our Investor Conference in December included the expected financial impact of this transaction, which Scott will discuss in a few minutes.","As a reminder, the mitral application of Cardioband has received a CE Mark in Europe and we're building a European field organization to begin training heart teams to perform this therapy. Additionally, prior to close, Valtech received a conditional approval to begin an IDE trial of Cardioband in the U.S. We're now assessing the trial design and expect enrollment to begin later this year. The Cardioband System for tricuspid regurgitation is in a CE Mark trial, which we expect to be fully enrolled in 2017.","In the Edwards CardiAQ program for transcatheter mitral replacement, we are focused on transseptal delivery. As we indicated during the Investor Conference, we're implementing key clinical learnings sequentially from our U.S. early feasibility study. Consistent with this approach, we recently paused enrollment in our clinical trials to perform further design validation testing on a feature of our valve. If we see positive results from the test, we expect to resume clinical trial enrollment in the second quarter. This pause also postpones the start of our CE Mark trial.","We continue to gain early clinical experience with our PASCAL transcatheter mitral repair system in compassionate cases. We're also gaining experience with Edwards FORMA, our spacer for treatment of tricuspid regurgitation, and are developing a larger spacer that would enable treatment of a broader group of patients. You can expect further updates from clinicians on these new structural heart programs at upcoming major medical meetings.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thanks, Mike. As Mike mentioned, we're pleased to report that with our strong finish to the year, we exceeded our revenue and earnings targets for 2016. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $2.89. Sales increased 18.5% on an underlying basis to nearly $3 billion.","In the fourth quarter, another strong sales performance in transcatheter valves drove significant top and bottom line growth versus the prior year. Underlying sales grew 15% and adjusted earnings per share grew 17% to $0.75. GAAP earnings per share was $0.73, which includes our customary adjustments for intellectual property litigation expenses and amortization of intangibles. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.","On January 23, we closed the acquisition of Valtech Cardio. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we delivered approximately $270 million in stock and $70 million in cash at closing. In addition, there is the potential for up to $350 million in pre-specified contingent payments over the next 10 years. Periodic accounting adjustments to these payments will be highlighted in future financial results. The financial guidance we provided at our Investor Conference in December incorporated the expected impact of the transaction in 2017.","And now, I'll cover the details of our results, and then share guidance for 2017. For the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 72.2% compared to 73.8% in the same period of 2015. This expected decrease was driven by a reduced year-over-year benefit from our foreign exchange hedge contracts and manufacturing expenses associated with capacity expansion. These decreases were partially offset by a more profitable product mix. We continue to expect our gross profit margin, excluding special items, to strengthen in 2017 to between 74% and 76%, driven by an improved product mix and the expected impact of foreign exchange.","Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses, fourth quarter expenses were $234 million or 30.4% of sales compared to $222 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by sales and personnel related expenses, primarily in transcatheter valves, partially offset by the suspension of the medical device excise tax. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 28% and 29% of sales for the full year 2017.","Research and development investments in the quarter grew 17% to $115 million or 15% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter aortic and mitral valve programs, including spending on clinical trials. For the full year 2017, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be between 16% and 17%.","Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20.9%, up from 15.7% in the prior year, which benefited from the renewal of the federal research and development tax credit. For the full year 2016, our tax rate was 22.8%.","Starting in 2017, our tax rate will reflect the new accounting standard for employee stock-based compensation and this forecasted impact is included in our guidance. This accounting benefit will fluctuate in each reporting period, making period comparisons less consistent. We intend to highlight the impact each period if material. We continue to expect our full-year 2017 tax rate, including the estimated impact of this accounting change, to be between 23% and 24%.","Foreign exchange rates positively impacted fourth quarter sales versus prior year by approximately $1 million. Compared to our October guidance, foreign exchange rates positively impacted earnings per share by $0.01.","Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $138 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $201 million, less capital expenses of $63 million. For the full year 2016, free cash flow was $528 million. We continue to expect full year 2017 free cash flow to be between $575 million and $650 million.","Turning to our balance sheet, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares for $246 million to help offset dilution associated with our Valtech acquisition. Average shares outstanding during the quarter were 218 million and we continue to expect our full year 2017 shares outstanding to be between 216 million and 218 million. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.3 billion. Total debt was $822 million, an increase reflecting our fourth quarter share repurchases.","And now turning to 2017 guidance, we are reiterating all of our 2017 ranges. For Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, we expect sales of $1.7 billion to $2 billion, including $10 million to $15 million of estimated Cardioband sales to be reported as part of THVT. For Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, we expect sales of $750 million to $790 million. And for Critical Care, we expect sales of $560 million to $600 million. For total Edwards, we expect sales of $3 billion to $3.4 billion. For full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share, we expect to be between $3.30 and $3.45.","Turning to the first quarter of 2017, we project total sales to be between $760 million and $800 million, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.79 to $0.89.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thanks, Scott. In conclusion, we're very pleased to achieve strong financial performance and significant progress on transformational new therapies across our businesses in 2016 and expect continued growth and progress in 2017. We are enthusiastic about the continued expansion of catheter-based therapies for the many structural heart patients in need, which positions us well for the long-term. We believe our patient-focused innovation strategy can transform care and bring value to both healthcare systems and shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David K. Erickson - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thank you, Mike. In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and we'll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the hour.","Operator, we're ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. And thank you. Our first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Mike, just a quick question for you on TAVR, and then maybe a follow-up on the clinical data. Just, I guess, investors are going to be very focused on sort of U.S. and ex-U.S. TAVR performance in this quarter. So I wonder if you can give us a sense in the U.S., how you think you've fared on share relative to a competitors' launch of a larger valve size? And in the international market, if we sort of adjust for France, it sort of seems that your ex-U.S. business has been pretty stable from a growth perspective in the back half of 2016, is that how you see it? So, two questions there, and a quick follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Okay. Thanks, David. Yeah, in the U.S., I think we would broadly say that share positions compared to the last couple of quarters have been pretty flat. I think we had a share gain versus the prior year, but they probably have been pretty comparable here over the recent past. If you go to Europe, I think your assessment is correct that if you take the French situation out, market shares once again were pretty stable. Overall, sort of the new competitors are accounting for something in the mid-teens of market share, so not a lot moved other than France.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Mike, just clinically, one of the big messages from the Analyst Day in December was the market development activities you have to engage in to get these younger less sick patients than intermediate risk. You've given that commentary at the Analyst Day, can you talk to us about the EARLY-TAVR program and why you're confident that's going to be a big commercial success given these are sort of asymptomatic patients relative to the market development things you discussed at the Analyst Day in intermediate risk? Thanks. I'll join back in queue.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Well, yeah, thanks, David. They're both really important. So, market development is probably more near-term and more important. As we indicated at the Investor Conference, we're penetrated maybe at the \u2013 our estimate was the 18% level and that that needed a move to something like to 30% level by 2021. So, for us to make sure that we're doing our work to properly make sure that physicians and patients have the best information is really important and we're focused on that. We're building that organization and we're building that capabilities.","But separate from that and you know we're long-run guys, we're engaged in wanting to study this group of patients that have not yet demonstrated symptoms. We're firm believers that people with severe aortic stenosis are really at risk and we're prepared to do the clinical study to test that. We won't get our results for a while, of course, but we think it could be very meaningful once you get out into the future, probably beyond 2021.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Hi, thanks. So, two questions, first, just a follow-up on that last comment. Mike, I want to get your opinion on something on EARLY-TAVR. Given these patients have to undergo a stress test, what percentage of the patients do you think might move from asymptomatic to symptomatic post this stress test as you enroll this trial? Trying to get a sense for could awareness in this trial actually help the symptomatic portion of the market well before the asymptomatics gets approved?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Bob. Yeah, that's a really good point and a good question. Frankly, we don't know a lot about this group of patients. We're really looking forward to learning much more about it. So, the real answer to your question is unknown. There are number of physicians we talked to that speculate that although the patients have previously been diagnosed with no symptoms that once they're on a treadmill, they might indeed have symptoms, which would mean that they would be candidates for the therapy in the near-term to either maybe if they're in intermediate risk to be treated commercially or if they're at low-risk to potentially go into the PARTNER III trial.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","So, the follow-up, to stick to TAVR, maybe you could talk just a little bit more about the fourth quarter U.S. market dynamics. I mean, I think your sequential revenue was only up $7 million, maybe just talk a little bit about, more about what you're seeing, any surprises in the quarter, just would like a little bit more color on what happened in Q4 in the U.S.?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah, thanks, Bob. I can't say there were any real surprises. It was pretty much as we expected. I will tell you the very end of the year finished stronger than we anticipated would. We did an estimate at the time of the Investor Conference never being too sure how it's going to turn out around the holiday period, and it \u2013 that turned out stronger than we thought. But other than that, I thought it went very much as we anticipated.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. So, let me just follow-up on TAVR first and then I wanted to switch over to mitral, if I can. So, France cost you $10 million this quarter. If you didn't have that $10 million headwind, your TAVR franchise would have grown 32% year-over-year. So, the questions there are, number one, do you recapture that $10 million in the first quarter, will that headwind go away? And then second, given the kind of global growth you're seeing, is 15% to 20% the right range for 2017?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yes. So, that share that we lost are those that $10 million probably went completely to Medtronic. Of course, our intention is to try and win those customers back, that's the goal of that, but hard for us to estimate if we can get that all back and how soon that might happen, that certainly will be our intention. But we \u2013 that's in front of us to do. They actually switched over into some core valve cases during that period. So, we've got some work to do.","Second question, Michael, tell me again what your question was about our growth rate?","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. So, if you adjust for France, you grew 32%, even including France, you grew 29% and so is 15% to 20% the right range? And then while I have you here, Mike, I want to do this, give us a little bit more on CardiAQ. Could you just kind of spell out for us a little bit better kind of what's going on and what the issue may or may not be?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. So, yeah, we think the 15% to 20% is right on. When we put that estimate in place at the time of Investor Conference, there wasn't a lot that we learned since that time, so we think that that is a good estimate and we would encourage you to think about that as you think about our growth rates.","In terms of CardiAQ, I'll just refer you back to what we said. We said that we are engaged in this and we've been going through this process where we tried to very thoughtfully make sure that we learned from all of our clinical experiences. And we saw something that we decided we wanted to \u2013 and this is again totally voluntary, go back and take a look at. And so, we're running some internal tests associated with that to make sure that we feel comfortable moving forward. We're doing this in complete cooperation with our clinical investigators. The teams continues to be very positive, but it's just a step that we're going to go through.","It's a bit of a signal of just how early this therapy is. We're still on our pretty steep learning curve across the board, we're seeing the learn in every case not only something about our device, we learn something about the procedure, something about imaging, and something about anticoagulation, and we're trying to apply all those learnings as we go.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just a few from me, all on Europe actually. So Mike, is it safe to assume that the CE Mark for CardiAQ in 2018 will get pushed out? France, can you talk about why it was $10 million this quarter and $5 million last quarter, and the outlook for France in 2017? And just lastly, Mike, the Cardioband roll out in Europe, could you give us a little bit more color on how that's going, and how you're going to get to $10 million to $15 million in sales in 2017? Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Okay. Let me try and walk you through it, Larry, and if I miss something, we'll come back to it. We were not saying that the CE Mark is off for 2018, it's still possible for us to get that. We'll keep you informed of all the developments. We're just pausing enrollment. And that's not really unexpected for something at this early stage and transformative.","Your second question about how we're going to perform in France, we would hope that we would do well. France is a growing market and we would hope to regain some, if not all, of that share during 2017. So, to your question of why was Q3 different than Q4, during Q3, people were still working off inventories and in Q4 they felt the full brunt of the effect. And so, I think it's just that simple.","Finally, your question was about Cardioband, we're early in this process. This only closed \u2013 what, a week ago. And so we're putting together a separate field organization in Europe, that's a combination of the team from Valtech and Edwards and we're getting ready to take the field. So, I don't have much more to report at this point, but we'll keep you posted, and each quarter we'll share with you our progress on sales.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to circle back to the Ultra launch and the CENTERA, I guess, CE Mark. I'm assuming that would also launch in the second half of 2017. Should we look for those devices to have an impact on your revenue, or how should we think about that?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So, yeah, we're very proud of those products. We think they are both going to be very well received by our customers. They're mostly going to \u2013 the Ultra product is particularly going to help the physicians and those heart teams do even better procedures. They're in our guidance, Brooks, so I wouldn't say that there is any upside beyond what's in our guidance. The CENTERA system, again, is in our guidance. We're excited about that. We think it has the opportunity to be best-in-class among self-expanding stents.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. And then, Mike, I wanted to circle back to France and I apologize, I'm just confused on the \u2013 how this kind of happened. I thought you guys had talked about France as a potential headwind in Q2. It seems like you were a little bit surprised by the impact in Q3 and then we're seeing a more full impact in Q4. So \u2013 and I thought I remembered that you had kind of renegotiated with the French government and you were able to get a little bit more volume in Q4. Am I thinking about that correctly or can you just give us a little bit more detail on kind of how that proceeded throughout the year? Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. Let me try and we can talk about it. Yeah, I think we saw the potential there in Q2. In Q3, we realized that it was a serious situation and we discontinued our shipments at that time. And I think we told you at that time that it was going to have impacts in both Q3 and Q4. I think the Q4 impact probably turned out to be a little larger than we thought. So even though we reached resolution during the fourth quarter, it turned out a little larger than we thought, but that's kind of the way that it played out. Is that clear?","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","I think so. I might follow back up with you offline.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Okay.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","I appreciate the comments, Mike. Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good afternoon, Mike. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is, we, as you do, believe there's a large prevalent (33:20) pool of untreated mainly elderly patients, and you referred to your kind of business development efforts for building that referral chain, and you're building an organization to do that. Could you speak to the details of that in any way?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. At this point, I'm not sure that this is worth detailing. We're adding some senior leadership that will bring some more experience, Edwards people that have experience with therapy adoption in other fields. Beyond that, we're going to use actually a host of different, I will call it methods to be able to drive education and therapy adoption.","In the U.S., it will be largely web-based, there will be \u2013 there is a lot of actually telephone conversations, and direct contact, and seminars in Europe and Japan that seem to be effective. So, there is going to be a variety of tools that are applied, and we'll try and be a little bit more granular for you as time goes on.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Perfect. And my follow-up is on EARLY-TAVR, could you share anything about the length of follow-up and the endpoints that might be used, and the length of enrollment?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So, it's designed to be a superiority study. It is randomized. We expect it to have a two-year composite endpoint, and the endpoint is likely to include death, stroke, and rehospitalization.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","We're going to randomize it between SAPIEN 3 and clinical surveillance, and I think it's going to have about 1,000 patients in it.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks so much, Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Super. Great. Mike, can you hear me okay?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. I hear you well, Jason.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. So, first question on TAVR O-U.S., Mike, if we add back the $10 million, it looks like sort of mid-20s growth comparably over the last sort of eight quarters, it would sort of challenge the best growth you've seen. And your commentary in your prepared remarks about Japan jumped out at me. Could you tease Japan out a little bit and give us some more color on the composition of that market and what you're projecting going forward?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. Without getting into specifics on Japan, I think there are just two companies approved in Japan and we're fortunate last year that we had SAPIEN 3 approved. And we've been really pleased at the way that the therapy is being adopted in Japan. If you'll recall, we got off to kind of a slow start a couple of years ago and there were a number of structural elements that were obstacles. But at this point, we feel like much of those have been cleared. I think, we're probably headed \u2013 maybe around 100 accounts in Japan and we continue to think that that has a total addressable opportunity of $300 million to $400 million.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. So that seems to be gaining traction. You'll have some easier comps in France clearly in the European side of your TAVR business, and the U.S. business you've talked a lot about and given some granularity here. And so, as you kind of look at the TAVR growth guidance for the year, 15% to 20%, and I think 30%-plus in the United States if I recall from your analyst meeting, it would imply that the O-U.S. assumption that you're making is at best 10%, maybe even high single digits. But given those tailwinds, how should we look at that? It sounds a bit conservative?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Well, we think, there's reasons to be conservative. We think, across Europe, it's been many years since this technology has been adopted. We expect the market's probably going to grow a little faster than Edwards that will lose a little bit of share, probably both in Europe and the U.S. So, I ask you to keep that in mind when you think about how realistic the 15% to 20% is. We think that's a pretty good estimate and not that conservative.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Great. And one quick and I'll get back in queue. Regarding EARLY-TAVR, given the new patient population in several centers, Mike, what \u2013 talk to us about the bandwidth of these centers, is there any risk to \u2013 this trial taking up enough time to have an impact on normal TAVR volumes? Thanks for taking the questions. I'll get back in queue.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks. We don't think so. We give our centers that are involved, for example, with us on the PARTNER trials an opportunity to enroll in the EARLY-TAVR, and we think it's been probably in excess of 90% of those centers have said that, yeah, they're interested and they feel like they do have the bandwidth to do that. The good news is they have infrastructure in place that they can leverage. So that's helpful. And this really is a new group of patients that they haven't addressed before. So we believe that they can handle it. We got a lot to learn, though, because this is a new field for us.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Please proceed.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much. So \u2013 and congrats on a nice job here in the fourth quarter. You know we've covered the TAVR performance and new centers a fair amount so far in the call, but I just wanted to clarify one thing, Mike, if I could, and then \u2013 and a couple of questions on some of the growth initiatives.","So, coming out of the Analyst Meeting, I think there was a lot of discussion and TCP in the Analyst Meeting about the need for market development, the need for education and awareness. That still sounds like it's important and you're starting to put that in place, but if I read your comments correctly, it doesn't sound like, if we look at the performance of Q4, that that has been \u2013 those efforts have had a significant impact yet. That would be something we'd expect to play out over the next, I don't know, several months or next year-and-a-half or so, is that a fair way to look at it?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","It is fair to look at it. We have some efforts in place and we're proud of those, but we think we're still relative novices at this and growing. So, we'd like to think we'd have \u2013 we'd be more effective in the future.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Terrific. And then on some of the growth in pipeline products and approvals you've talked about, I wanted to touch on a few if I could. And starting with CENTERA and I did want to ask about your tricuspid and mitral for just a quick check, but the CENTERA product, could you tell us what we should expect to see and hope to see when we might see it that would tell us that it's going to achieve the kind of performance you're hoping it could in order to be an important add to your SAPIEN platform?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So, as we've indicated, we expect to get the CE Mark by the end of the year and we expect it to be based on data that probably is presented at EuroPCR meeting in May. So, I think that's going to be a good chance for you to get a look at that, Matt, and be able to judge what kind of a therapy that is.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And I know we talked about Cardioband, the mitral, you'd mentioned at your meeting also that you're kicking off or beginning to initiate this study for Cardioband TR, any sense of when we'll see \u2013 start to see some tricuspid data or short track results out of that initiative?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Even though, the Valtech is new to Edwards, we also are excited about Cardioband for tricuspid regurgitation. And they tell us they've got some pretty good momentum, so we believe that that CE Mark trial could be enrolled by the end of 2017.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","And then finally, if I could, on similar category of product here on PASCAL, you talked about kicking off the CE Mark study in this year, any update on timing or expectations for that would be helpful, for the mitral valve repair?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. I don't have any update on that one. We'll keep you tuned in, Matt, and we'll need to let other people ask questions, thanks.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please proceed.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, Mike. Let me start with something that's coming up and I think it's certainly new since the Analyst Day, the SURTAVI data, intermediate risk data from Medtronic is coming up at ACC as the late breaker. I mean, I think that's certainly a faster date than I expected back in December. If we can assume it's going to be positive, how do we think about this? Can we view this as a positive data there, as a positive class effect for intermediate risk adoptions sort of similar to other large positive data sets we've seen in the past, and could that, should that, would that potentially accelerate intermediate risk adoption for all?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. We \u2013 I think, your point's a good one. We think if they have \u2013 if they show good results, that's only a positive for patients, not only it helps transcatheter aortic valve replacement therapy as a total class. And so, we actually hope that they're successful in treating these patients and we'll be anxiously awaiting the results like you.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. And maybe, Scott, one for you. First quarter guidance, I think I get the revenue range, but the EPS range seems unusually wide, maybe just help us understand some of the factors, is this more revenue, or margin, or currency that's creating this \u2013 the $0.10 range? Thank you.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. It's not uncommon, and it's probably not FX, because most of our EPS volatility or unpredictability is addressed through our hedge programs. So, it's really going to be more driven by revenue, and that's been the largest driver of our earnings so far, and our margins, and that's really, probably that's going to have it end up wherever it ends up in the range. But I'd point you to the middle of the range for modeling purposes.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two on mitral. First on the Cardioband. One of the pointed feedback on that product is that it is a relatively long procedure, it could be an hour and a half, two hours to put that device in. And so, I guess I'm curious what your thoughts are around that, and as we've now taken it in, if you see the prospect to shorten the time to implant for that?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Raj. Yeah, there are a number of things about the Cardioband that we find attractive, but there's also opportunities for improvement. And yeah, absolutely, one of them is to shorten procedure times. Those can be really very lengthily and tedious, and we have a number of ideas that the R&D team has to be able to shorten this procedure time. And so that's going to be one of the key areas of focus for us as well as to try and put some engineering into the system to improve reliability and take out cost.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Fair enough. And then maybe just one on CardiAQ. I know it's probably premature to be thinking about what might come after that, assuming that maybe you can't fix what the problem is. But you've sort of shelved your own program and you chose not to buy or to take in Valtech's mitral valve initially. But how do we think about what comes next in potential delays in timing now that this might represent?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah, I'm not going to speculate. There's really a broad range of things that could happen from where we are right now. Just to be clear, we just suspended clinical enrollments. We didn't really pause the whole program. And I don't know that pausing is that unusual for this sort of an early stage in transformative technology. As I tried to relate earlier, we're on a steep learning curve and to place a valve in the mitral position is a tough task and to do it well. The valves are large. The pressures are high. The anatomy is very complex. There are very serious imaging challenges. There's coagulation challenges. And so we're on a steep learning curve and we're very pleased at the pace that we're moving at. We just decided on this feature that we were going to pause this while we're going through our own internal tests. So we'll keep you tuned in. And we're hopeful that it's positive and that we'll be back rolling again in the second quarter.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Mike, talk about how you screen patients for EARLY-TAVR. Obviously, these are asymptomatic patients. Are there some obvious signs and signals that people suggest they can find these patients easily or is that part of the learning process?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","So I'll tell you my understanding and then again I'm not an expert. And I think, collectively, the clinical community is going to learn something as well. These are patients again with severe aortic stenosis. So someone has done an echo or an ultrasound on this patient and found that their valve is closed. So typically, it starts out with a murmur. They get a diagnostic echo. That echo says that they have severe aortic stenosis. But their physician does not diagnose symptoms. So I think the first step of the clinical trial actually is to put this patient on a treadmill in addition to a number of other diagnostic tests. And so this would be the first interesting test. And then ultimately if they show no \u2013 demonstrate a lack of symptoms, they'd be randomized between getting a transcatheter aortic SAPIEN 3 by femoral delivery or just clinical surveillance.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Do you have any sense of how many patients are out there with a positive echo but no symptoms?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","We don't have a good sense. When we did our early estimates, we felt that there may be as many asymptomatic or patients without symptoms as patients with symptoms. Again, that's what the clinical community would estimate. And we believe that a lot of those patients are probably out of the system. Now, there are also a number of hospitals that tell us that they actually have groups of patients that have no symptoms that they could name names on. So again, we're going into a bit of uncharted territory, Ben, and we'll keep you tuned in on what we learn.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And if I can sneak in one on the SAVR side, you talked about kind of the new products helping offset the impact of volume. But what is the volume assumption for 2017 guidance in surgical valves?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","So if you're to say what we think is going to happen in Europe, in the U.S.; we think that the number of procedures would be down slightly, so down a few percent in terms of the total number of procedures done in Europe or done in the U.S. And that again is of surgical isolated aortic procedures, right. We expect that we offset that decline through our new products. So through new products and share gain, that our sales would actually grow 1% to 3%.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","And is any of that price or is that just share?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Well, some of it, I suppose you would say, turns out in price. So for example, when a physician chooses to use an INTUITY Elite valve instead of a Magna Ease valve, the value that they would impart would be higher to Edwards. Obviously, you're getting a higher value. So you'd see that, I suppose, in the price relationship. But the other part might just be share gain associated with our products that are best-in-class and we're the market share leader on.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, gentlemen. I was hoping \u2013 so I apologize, Scott, this first question is for you, a little bit granular. But with the focus and intense focus on the sequential growth in the U.S. TAVR business, I was wondering if you'd be willing to just lay out any of the potential headwinds outside of just the core clinical utilization either on the royalty side or the clinical revenue side in the quarter?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. So clinical revenues did decline in the second half of 2016 as intermediate risk patients went from clinical to commercial after we got the approval. And we expect clinical revenues should increase again during 2017 in connection with PARTNER III. But the growth rates in the U.S. have gone from \u2013 last year, they were at 64% in Q1 and then 66%, 55% in Q3 and 41% in Q4. And now it's expected. It's really the law of big numbers that's driving the decline in the growth rates. And ultimately, we don't expect that there are any new headwinds or considerations other than the ones we've been talking about.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","And was there anything specific on the royalty? $2.5 million can account for about 100 basis points of sequential growth at these levels?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","So there's nothing really that we expect to change with the royalties. We've guided people to assume about $10 million per quarter. And that's about what we've been running with a couple of exceptions, where we might have a quarter where there is a true-up and it ends up being more than that. But generally, $10 million a quarter or $40 million for the year is the right assumption for royalties.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then, Mike, just one kind of longer-term question for you. Some of our clinical checks with surgeons and talking about holding on to patients that are either younger and lower STS scores in the intermediate category or maybe eventually even low-risk patients, and what they hang their hat on is durability. And I was just hoping you could kind of give us your internal roadmap of how you see that question being answered. I know we're looking out a number of years. But what clinical trial dataset, do you think, gets us the answer? And what is the duration of data that we need to see? Is that 7, 8, 10 years? Appreciate it.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Matt. It's not unusual if you go out there to speak to surgeons to find some that have a lot of confidence in their own ability to do great surgery on intermediate-risk or low-risk patients. We really don't find that as a surprise. The surgeons that are already on heart teams at TAVR centers seem to really understand the value of the therapy. And those referral processes seem to go much better. When you're in hospital systems where there is no TAVR and only surgical valve replacement is available, probably those surgeons are less \u2013 probably understand less the value of TAVR and the importance of TAVR.","So it's part of probably our system moving a little slow, probably not a big surprise to us. That's in our estimates. We know that it's going to take some time and it'll be a cumulative sort of weight of the data that'll ultimately influence them. We're really pleased that we have powerful data in PARTNER I and PARTNER II. We've got PARTNER III right behind it and then EARLY-TAVR right behind that. So we're going to bring big powerful studies that are highly scientific to bear and ultimately we think the weight of that data will carry the day.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. My first question, Mike, just on the intermediate adoption curve. As now we've had a full quarter of intermediate in terms of the label, have you gone out or your sales team has gone out and have you been able to assess how the TAVR centers are absorbing these new patients? Are they able to get extra lab time? Are they hiring new operators? I just want to make sure that there's no structural roadblocks to the market picking up with all these intermediates coming into the marketplace. And then I had two quick follow-ups.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. As you know, no two sites are alike. But I would say broadly that we really have not seen structural roadblocks, that sites have had an amazing ability to add capacity and cases per day. And in some cases, it's been pretty significant that they're able to do even four cases a day with SAPIEN 3. So they get a pretty good capacity bump out of it. And so, no, structurally, I really don't think that's the core issue.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then two quick follow-ups. One, you said you're implanting at over 500 centers in 2016. So how many centers did you add in 2016 and how many you expect to add in 2017? And then on the CardiAQ, are you still developing that device for transapical? Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yes. So, yeah, I don't remember the exact numbers. But I want to guess that it's around 50 centers that we added during 2016. Gives you a sense of what we've done. And then your question about transapical was on which system?","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","On the CardiAQ...","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Are you still going forward with a transapical system? And then I also asked about how many centers you thought you'd add in 2017.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So, yes, indeed, we are moving forward with the transapical system as well. When we adopted that CardiAQ, one of the things that we found attractive is that we could have one valve with two delivery systems. And so, yeah, that is an important element. In terms of number of centers in 2017, is that TAVR centers that you're asking about?","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, correct.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So 2017, we're likely to get some growth. We expect that to probably slow some, not to be as big as the growth in 2016. There are still centers that are interested in joining, but we expect that to be at a reduced rate. It's hard for me to estimate just what that would be.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good evening and very nice quarter. A couple of things. Starting off with something boring like gross margins. You had 72.5% in the fourth quarter and yet your guidance for the year is 74% to 76%. For modeling purposes, how should we think about that progression?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. It was actually 72.2% for Q4. It was about 73.1% for the full year 2016. And the best modeling assumption for 2017 is right in the middle of the 74% to 76% range. And the difference is take from 73% roughly for 2016 and add about 100 basis points for mix and about 100 basis points for FX.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, that's helpful. And then and possibly more interesting, can you talk a little bit about the international market? You think that the $10 million from lost French sales went to Medtronic. But bigger picture, what's really going on in that market as it relates to market shares and shifts with some newer products coming in? Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So, yeah, there have been some new products. But overall, there hasn't been a big change that we've observed over the past several quarters. The new competitors are still having some impact. I think, total, they're in the mid-teens sort of level of market share. And outside of what happened in France, we haven't seen a lot. ASPs have been very stable across Europe. So again, you know that we're selling at a premium and sometimes that premium's quite large. It could be even larger than 20% in some places. But there's no significant changes in the market dynamics, Joanne.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Please proceed.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. First of all, I was wondering if you could parse out a little bit more the impact, if any, of the competitor's large valve in the quarter. I believe they launched about a month into the quarter. It sounds like maybe you didn't see an impact at all. And where did you make that up, if you did not? Because presumably they did gain some share in that 34 millimeter size.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. You know what, I think the quarter turned out pretty much the way that we expected to. It was maybe a little bit stronger than we thought based on how the year closed out. I don't know what to tell you about that. Our 29 millimeter valve serves most sizes of patients. And so we don't really feel like we lose patients in that regard. And that a large-size valves is already factored into our guidance. So there was really nothing new there.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, that's fair. And then, Mike, I'm just trying to get a handle on where we are in intermediate risk. So I appreciate all the market development efforts you guys are putting forth. And those have yet to really take hold and bear fruit. But do you have a sense now of, in the U.S. market, what percentage of patients are intermediate risk or where we are in intermediate risk penetration? If you look at your own patient population, the patients that are getting SAPEIN 3; how many of those are intermediate risk versus high risk or inoperable?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah, thanks. I know it must be frustrating. But we really would like to steer you away from just isolating, looking at just the risk factors. As we tried to talk about it at our investor conference, there are a number of factors the heart teams take into consideration, which include risk or \u2013 but certainly everything about their \u2013 the anatomy of these patients and the frailty of these patients. And so it is multi-factorial and it's done by these multi-disciplinary teams. I'd encourage you to go broader. We feel like there's about 650,000 patients out there with severe aortic stenosis and the treatment rate right now is around 18%. And so our job is to see if we can improve that and improve the lives of these patients and our performance as well.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","All right. Thanks so much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please proceed.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Mike, Dr. Therani (01:01:28) had a presentation at SVS in which he highlighted the fact that a quarter of the patients in the surgical arm of PARTNER IIA also had some other surgical interventions while they were on the operating table. And that those patients then had a higher event rate than those that underwent isolated AVR. One of the questions coming out of that presentation was whether that made it a bit of an apples to oranges comparison versus TAVR. Could you just comment on that paper?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Well, I'm not intimately familiar with it. It sounds like that's real world and that reflects what patients go through. And so I would say typically when a surgeon opens a patient, they are going to consider from time to time are there other things that they should do because this is a pretty big procedure to take a patient through and they're not going to miss the opportunity to do more. So I think that when it's all done, it probably is a realistic comparison of what goes on in the real world.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And then in a few weeks, Claret's going to go to an FDA panel. And there's another embolic protection system not that far behind them. What are your latest thoughts about the need for embolic protection during TAVR and do you guys have any plans to revive your internal program?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Our thinking really hasn't changed dramatically on this, Chris. We continue to feel that with the stroke rate that's as low as it is \u2013 and you saw what the stroke rate looked like for a SAPIEN 3. They're in the neighborhood of 1% at 30 days. That adding another delivery system and another catheter potentially adds as much risk as it erases. And so for the additional cost and risk associated with it, we have a tough time endorsing that therapy.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And do you think that the way you're measuring it in the trials is capturing the full scope of neurological complications? One of the pushbacks that those companies would say is that we are missing some stuff. When you look at their event rates in the trials, and they're quite a bit higher, although maybe some of those are sub-clinical.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. I couldn't be more proud of the way that we assess stroke risk in our trials. I don't know if you recall what happens. But we actually have a neurologist, not a cardiologist, but a neurologist do an assessment before the procedure. And then they do the follow-up assessment. So you have a neurological assessment by somebody that's detached from this and they're highly qualified to be able to assess stroke risk. Now, if you would compare it to an MRI, we'd argue that that is sub-clinical often. So we think that our trial has probably some of the best and most robust data generated related to stroke.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. Okay, well, thanks all for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, David and I welcome additional questions by telephone.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David K.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference to your host, Mr. David Erickson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Erickson. You may begin.","David Erickson","Welcome and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our second quarter 2015 financial results. During today's call, we will discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO and Scott Ullem, CFO.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include but aren't limited to financial guidance and current expectations for clinical, regulatory and commercial matters as well as future product strategies. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today.","Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences may be found in our press release, our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, which are available on our website at edwards.com.","Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying and excluding special items, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release and on our website.","Now I will turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Mike Mussallem","Thank you, David. We are very pleased to report strong second quarter performance, led by underlying sales growth of 18%. Significant global TAVR therapy adoption drove our results which was also boosted by contributions from our surgical valve and critical care product lines. During the quarter, we are also pleased to receive U.S. approval of SAPIEN 3, our next generation transcatheter valve, which has demonstrated improved outcomes for high-risk patients suffering from severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis.","In THV, underlying global sales grew 42%. Impressive procedure growth resulted in strong sales of our innovative, market-leading products in the U.S. and internationally. Globally, average selling prices remain stable. In the U.S., underlying THV sales for the quarter were $149 million, which includes a boost from royalty and grew 62% versus the prior year. Our performance was driven by strong procedure growth and as expected clinical sales from our SAPIEN 3 continued access program. Stocking and consignment had a minimal impact.","In mid-June we received the FDA approval for our next-generation SAPIEN 3 valve with its Commander delivery system for high risk patients in the U.S. Commercial sales of our most advanced transcatheter heart valve began earlier this month and clinical demand has been very strong. Given the earlier than anticipated approval, we are ramping up supply and continue to expect our rollout to be completed by year-end. Training physicians to use SAPIEN 3 is a fairly straightforward process that involves a focus program designed to ensure excellent patient outcomes. Even though SAPIEN 3 has superior results, we have not instituted price increases, so that as this therapy becomes more efficient providers, payors and ultimately patients benefit.","The U.S. procedure growth has continued to be robust this quarter. Starting in the third quarter, the launch of our next-generation product should help expand therapy adoption and partially mitigate the tougher prior year comparisons. Expanding the indication to treat intermediate risk patients remains a key focus. As a reminder, we will reach the one-year endpoint for SAPIEN 3 and the two-year endpoint for SAPIEN XT about the same time around be around year-end. Assuming a positive trial and an expedited FDA review, we plan for a late 2016 approval with a minimal contribution to sales next year. Additionally, we will seek to extend the SAPIEN 3 intermediate risk continued access program until the approval.","Outside the U.S., THV sales grew 25% on an underlying basis during the quarter, once again driven by strong procedure growth broadly across most countries in Europe and continued progress in Japan. Average selling prices remained stable. In Japan, our sales continue to grow sequentially. Reimbursement for our 20 and 29 mm SAPIEN XT valves was approved in the second quarter, which will help broaden the population of patients who can benefit from this technology. In Europe, we estimate overall therapy adoption grew more than 25%. Even as competitive pressures increase, our growth rate increased roughly in line. We believe demand remains strong us patients are continuing to come off the sidelines. This was driven by growing therapy awareness, an increasing trend of physicians referring more patients to TAVR, continued positive data and favorable clinical experience.","At the recent EuroPCR conference, one year SAPIEN 3 data for high-risk patients was presented. This multicenter, nonrandomized study of 150 patients demonstrated our best survival and lower stroke rates for these patients at one year. Also presented were 30 day outcomes for intermediate risk patients treated transfemorally with SAPIEN 3, which demonstrated very low mortality and stroke rates and no severe paravalvular leaks. The SAPIEN 3 clinical data presented over the past few months at most major medical meetings represent the largest, most definitive data in the industry with more than 1,800 patients treated. The excellent outcomes have been consistent across our studies and geographies and we remain confident in the future expansion of this therapy.","In summary, we are committed to leadership in TAVR even as competition increases. Starting in the third quarter, prior year comparisons will get tougher, but the launch of next-generation products should help expand therapy adoption. We are very encouraged by the strength of THV in the first half of 2015. Given this performance in the early U.S. approval of SAPIEN 3, we now expect our underlying sales growth in 2015 to be in the 25% to 35% range.","Turning to surgical heart valve therapy product group. TOTAL sales this quarter were $204 million, up 3.5% on an underlying basis. Growth was driven by global surgical heart valve unit growth, partially offset by the ongoing exit of previously announced non-strategic products. A favorable product mix also contributed to a higher overall ASP. Globally, underlying surgical valve unit growth was led by sales of our premium valves across all major regions. INTUITY Elite drove sales growth in Europe and China's solid performance continued to lead growth in the rest of the world. In the U.S., we experienced strong growth in both aortic and mitral units, driven by our premium magna products. Our activities in support of U.S. approval for Edwards INTUITY Elite remains on track and we expect the launch in 2016.","In summary, we are pleased with the strength of our premium products in our surgical heart valve product group and based on our first half performance tempered by the continued exit of non-strategic products, we now expect underlying sales growth to be at the high end of the 1% to 3% range for 2015.","Turning to critical care product group. Total sales for the quarter were $131 million and grew 1.3% on an underlying basis. Outside the U.S., sales continued to be strong in China, but we await a final reimbursement decision for ClearSight in Japan. As the leader in hemodynamic monitoring, our enhanced surgical recovery program continues to gain momentum. ESR's focus on reducing patient complications and hospital lengths of stay continues to resonate strongly with clinicians and represents a large global underpenetrated opportunity.","Overall in critical care, we are pleased with the continuing adoption of ESR products, which are expected to grow double digits this year. And even though this quarter's results were impacted by a tough prior-year comparison, we are reiterating our underlying sales growth guidance of 2% to 4% for 2015.","Now to update you on our transcatheter mitral valve programs. In May, we announced the temporary pause in FORTIS enrollment due to the observation of valve thrombosis in some patients. We have been working closely with the heart teams involved in the clinical program and recently completed a review of the patients who have received FORTIS. Based on our findings, we have incorporated protocol revisions related to patient selection, post procedural drug regimens and enhanced imaging surveillance following the procedures. We have received FDA approval to move forward with our early feasibility study and we plan to discuss our updated TMVR strategy at a later date.","As previously announced, earlier this month we signed an agreement to acquire CardiAQ Valve Technologies, a privately held developer of transcatheter mitral valve replacement system for up to $400 million. While we remain pleased with the significant progress made by the FORTIS program, we were attracted to CardiAQ because of their unique technology, including a differentiated attachment approach and a single valve with multiple delivery systems. We were also encouraged by their recent clinical progress.","From a regulatory standpoint, they have made considerable progress, including FDA approval to initiate an early feasibility study of up to 20 patients and they also expect to start a CE Mark study in Europe in the near future. We believe the acquisition and integration will further advance our development of a transformational therapy for patients with mitral valve disease who aren't well served today. The experiences and technologies of Edwards and CardiAQ are complementary and this combination should enable more advancements for patients in the future.","We are excited to invite their team to joining Edwards upon closing the acquisition and we are proud of the progress made by our FORTIS team and the combination of these talented employees is very helpful for the development of future structural heart disease technologies. We will share our updated TMVR plans following completion of the acquisition.","And now I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Ullem","Thanks, Mike. We achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share this quarter of the $1.13, which compares to 2014 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share or $0.88. This increase was driven primarily by our THV sales performance. As a reminder, last year our GAAP results included the large litigation settlement.","As I mentioned last quarter, Edwards' earnings are subject to a significant impact as a result of the large movements in currencies. However, unlike some other companies in our sector, our 2015 earnings will be largely insulated as a result of our current foreign currency hedging strategy. If rates remain at current levels, it's important to understand that our company will ultimately realize a significant negative foreign exchange impact on earnings in 2016.","This quarter, our non-GAAP sales were $622 million, reflecting 18% underlying growth as compared to last year. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continued to have a significant negative impact on reported sales. At constant currency rates, sales would been approximately $50 million higher. U.S. THV's non-GAAP sales this quarter of $149 million adds back a $5 million reserve relating to the launch of SAPIEN 3. Recall that accounting rules require that we record a reserve against sales of valves that we forecast will be exchanged for next-generation products in the future and require that we reverse this reserve when we ship the replacement products. In order to be transparent and to improve comparability of our quarterly THV sales, we are providing the impact of this reserve, including supplemental information our website.","In addition, we recorded a separate write-off for the cost of SAPIEN XT products that will not be sold. The combined impact of the SAPIEN XT sales reserve and inventory write-off reduced our GAAP earnings per share by $0.10 in the second quarter and has been added back in our non-GAAP results.","I will now cover the details behind our results, including guidance for the remainder of the year. For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 74.3%, which included the items just discussed relating to the U.S. launch of SAPIEN 3. In the second quarter, gross margin would have been approximately two percentage points higher without the new product launched impact.","Now comparing to last year, favorable product mix boosted margins about 1.5 percentage points. Foreign exchange also contributed about three percentage points, which was substantially offset by multiple investments in our operations, including cost of improving our manufacturing processes. If FX rates remain at current levels, we now expect our full-year gross profit rate to be between 76% and 77%, excluding special items. As a reminder for 2016, at current rates, as favorable hedge positions roll off, we do not expect to realize the same positive contributions to gross profit we are experiencing in 2015.","Second quarter selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1% over the prior year to $214 million or 34.7% of sales. This decrease was driven by the favorable FX impact on our expenses outside the U.S. We now expect SG&A excluding special items, to be at the low end of the 35% to 36% range of sales for the full year.","Research and development expenses in the quarter increased 9% to $97 million or 15.8% of sales. This increase was primarily a result of continued investments in our aortic and mitral valve programs. We now expect our R&D investments, including the impact from the pending CardiAQ acquisition to be at the high end of 15% to 16% of sales for the full year.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $2 million, down from $3 million in the prior year. This reduction was driven by increased interest income from higher investment balances and higher yields. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $10 million.","Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, which benefited from an improved country income mix and the impact of the THV inventory write-off. We continue to expect our full-year tax rate, excluding the impact of special items, to be between 21% to 23%. The tax rate for the first three quarters should be higher than the fourth based on our assumption of a fourth quarter renewal of the federal Research and Development Tax Credit.","Compared to our February guidance, foreign exchange rates had a negligible impact on earnings per share. At current rates, we continue to estimate at approximately $190 million negative impact to full year 2015 sales. The resulting impact to 2015 earnings should be mitigated by our FX hedges.","Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $152 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $170 million, less capital spending of $18 million. At the end of the quarter, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.4 billion. Total debt was approximately $600 million. We plan to fund the pending CardiAQ acquisition using our existing cash.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 580,000 shares for $79 million. We continue to estimate diluted shares outstanding for the full year to be at the high end of our previous range of 109 million to 111 million shares.","Now turning to our 2015 guidance. For transcatheter heart valve therapy, due to the strong second quarter performance and earlier than expected SAPIEN 3 approval in the U.S., we now expect sales to be at or slightly above the high end of our original guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We continue to expect sales for surgical heart valves at the lower end of our $780 million to $820 million range and for critical care at the lower end of our $520 million to $570 million range. We continue to expect total sales of between $2.3 and $2 billion.","Given the first outperformance of transcatheter heart valves and the earlier approval of SAPIEN 3 in the U.S., we are raising our full year diluted earnings per share guidance to between $4.30 and $4.40, excluding special items. This guidance includes the expected impact of the pending CardiAQ acquisition. For the full-year 2015, we expect free cash flow, excluding special items, to be at the high end of our previous range of $375 million to $425 million. For the third quarter 2015, which is typically our seasonally lowest quarter, at current foreign exchange rates we project total sales to be between $580 million and $620 million and diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be between $0.92 and $1.","And with that, I will hand it back to Mike.","Mike Mussallem","Thanks, Scott. In conclusion, our strong year-to-date progress reinforces our leadership position and places Edwards on a path to exceed our earlier financial expectations as greater number of patients are served by transcatheter therapies. And we believe we are poised for continued growth as we remain committed to our strategy of transforming patient care with innovative technologies.","And with that, I will turn it back over to David.","David Erickson","Thank you, Mike.

If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and we will answer as many as we can during the remainder of the hour.","Operator, we are ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Larry Biegelsen","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on another strong quarter. Guys, let me just start off with the guidance. You raised the transcatheter heart valve guidance to 25% to 35%, but you have kept the $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion range for total sales. Is it safe to say you expect to come in towards the high end of that range? And had one follow-up. Thanks.","Scott Ullem","Hi, Larry, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. The $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion range is still the right number to assume. Again, there is FX running through the dollar range and the underlying growth rate range is the one that we raised for THV.","Larry Biegelsen","Okay. Got it. And Mike, when do you think we will have visibility on the low risk regulatory pathways in the U.S.? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Mike Mussallem","Larry, right now, we have got all of our focus on the intermediate risk approval. You know we are long-term planners and so we are always looking ahead at things like low risk and this is an item that has much discussion. But at this point, I think it is premature to say that we have a strategy. We will let you know. We will obviously keep you posted on that. But again, given the importance, we are really focused on the intermediate risk right now.","Larry Biegelsen","All right. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","David Roman","Thank you. Good evening, everybody. I wanted to just start with the U.S. TAVI visits. Can you help us dissect in a little bit more detail the drivers of the sequential increase versus the first quarter? How much of that came from overall market activity potentially stimulated by some of the data at ACC versus the SAPIEN 3 cap versus any other factors that you think are worth calling out.","Mike Mussallem","Thanks, David. We had signaled that the continued access program was going to help us. That may have added something in the $10 million range to the quarter, but I think your other observations are the bigger one. The ACC data was presented toward the end of Q1 and that really had some significant, probably have some impact in the quarter. It's always tough for us to predict quarter-to-quarter changes but we just continue to see strong market adoption, broadly the same trends that we have seen before. The awareness is still growing and just confirms that there is more of these untreated patients out there. I think even the SAPIEN XT technology still it was driving growth. The hospital economics, we believe, are getting better. We see them adding capacity. And I don't know, maybe these new entrants are actually stimulating some growth as well.","David Roman","Okay. That's helpful. So as you look forward and you think about the impact of SAPIEN 3, in your prepared remarks you talked about that being an important step in therapy adoption. Can you maybe compare the importance of the SAPIEN 3 launch relative to XT? The importance of XT versus the base SAPIEN product? And whether we should expect a material change in market adoption that we did, that we saw last year occur on a go forward basis?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, David. You are asking a really tough question. Frankly it's very difficult for us to predict the future. But going back to your point, we saw in Europe that when SAPIEN 3 was introduced that there was a step up in therapy adoption. And that that was meaningful. We think it's very possible that that's going to happen in the U.S. Clinician demand is very high. And you can see we obviously upped our estimate for transcatheter heart valve sales in the back half and some of it is because of SAPIEN 3 and that's going to, we think, is largely going to be market growth. Now at the same time, the competition is increasing and there is also an approval that our competitor got, so that's going to work against the other way.","David Roman","Understood. Maybe just a quick financial one for Scott. On the dilution from CardiAQ, you brought it up in the R&D line associated with brain to the high end of the range, where else is that showed in the P&L and are you willing to quantify the total annualized dilution on an EPS basis?","Scott Ullem","Well, first of all, the acquisition hasn't closed yet. And so it depends on when the acquisition is going to close, but it will really show up in the P&L principally on the R&D line and the net impact to earnings per share is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.02 or $0.03 per quarter.","Mike Mussallem","Thanks for the questions, David. But we really would like to ask all callers to try and stick to a couple questions.","Scott Ullem","Just one last note. The CardiAQ impact is all baked into our guidance as well.","David Roman","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Brooks West","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just quick, did you give Japan revenues or the Medtronic royalty for the quarter?","Scott Ullem","We did not give either one of those. If you recall back, just on the Medtronic royalties, we had a partial quarter. You remember the minimum is running around $10 million. I think we have probably on the order $5 million last year. So we had about $5 million bump this year. We just said Japan stepped up sequentially.","Brooks West","Okay. And then, Mike, on the mitral program, now you have got two replacement technologies. You have talked about actually developing a portfolio there, may be thinking about repair and other products. Could you just update us on where you are now with that thought process?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. We think very broadly about structural heart disease and particularly about the mitral valve. And I think we have been pretty open in the past to say that we don't think that there is just going to be one solution for all patients. There probably will be some combination of replacement and repair technologies that will make sense and we really have a strategic imperative for ourselves to be a leader in this space. So we continue to work very closely at repair technologies in addition to replacement ones. And we have some internal programs, but I think that's all we have shared at this point.","Brooks West","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Weinstein","Thanks, guys. So if I look at the quarter, there is really kind of two story lines. The first one is, one you were touching on earlier, which is the U.S. market accelerating again on the back of ACC and now you have got SAPIEN 3 to add to it. The other storyline is, obviously that Europe continues to do better than we were all expecting and it continues to show a very strong growth. Can you maybe help us with a little bit light on that? Can you just talk maybe about the growth in different parts of Europe and where growth maybe faster today versus other geographies? So if you can give us a sense of what's Germany growing at, in your view, not you but the market versus say southern Europe, that type of commentary?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, Mike. I think what we have tried to indicate here is, we have really nice results in Europe and that's been because the market has been growing. And it does impress us that the market is continuing to grow at this kind of rate. I wish I could tell you that it's one country, Mike, but it really isn't. It's all the countries involved. When a country is as largest Germany, you can imagine it has to grow otherwise the rest of Europe doesn't growth at that rate. So yes, Germany is growing. But no, Germany is not the fastest growing country in Europe. There's several others that are growing faster and all the big countries and the small countries are all showing pretty significant growth. We can go back to the reasons, but it's going to be the ones we have talked about in the past, awareness, clinical, favorable clinical outcomes, the advanced technologies clearly seem to accelerate things and people are seeing good results.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. And Mike, one follow-up. So on the back of CardiAQ and that acquisition, can you just talk a little bit about how you are feeling about one, your balance sheet and two, deploying capital in acquisitions such as what you saw to do it, which is basically you think you are more bets in here with TMVR but your appetite to place bets in other areas as well.","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Thanks. We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and we like that. We think the most important use of our cash is to be able to drive growth in our business and we stay on the outlook. We have a very active program. We call it, our discovery of resources that are out there looking at what's exciting, particularly in the field of structural heart disease. And so we are out there aggressively looking at it. We have got quite a bit going on inside the company, but we will not hesitate to do something like CardiAQ if we see something that we think is attractive and can be meaningful for these structural heart disease patients.","Mike Weinstein","Just the one follow-up. So should we expect there to be more deals over the next, basically balance of the year? Or is this a one-off?","Mike Mussallem","Mike, I don't know what to tell you. We look at those very carefully. It's not like we automatically have a number of deals that we are trying to hit some number, some artificial number. This is based on our assessment of what makes sense. If we saw something good, we would do it and if we don't see anything attractive, we won't do it. And it's that simple.","We need to let others go, Mike. So thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","David Lewis","Good afternoon. Just two quick questions. I guess, first for Scott. This is an encouraging SG&A quarter. I think SG&A was down on an absolute basis for the first time in 10 years. I kind of stopped counting. So the guidance seems conservative but it also suggests the quarter is probably not an anomaly. So are we starting to see the evidence of more pronounced leverage in the model, Scott?","Scott Ullem","Well, keep in mind, the reason the dollar amount of SG&A was down was principally because of FX. So we are translating our oUS SG&A at lower rates and that helps. But it also came in exactly, we were pretty close to actually to where we thought it was going to be. And I think our guidance for the year is still the right kind of guidance. Longer-term, absolutely we are really looking at SG&A in particular, as an area where we can get leverage out of the P&L as our business continues to grow.","David Lewis","Okay. That's a tough one. And then Mike, I wondered if you could help us put the mitral acquisition of a CardiAQ in perspective? I kind of go back to you bought PVT. Obviously, PVT was early, but they were the clear leader in the marketplace and we have sort of a different dynamic here with the acquisition you made recently. Can you help us understand the similarities and differences between how you look at PVT versus CardiAQ?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. It's a great question, David. Just to contrast, back in the early days, we were pretty proud of our own transcatheter aortic program at the time when we bought it. Even though I think now people look back and say wow, PVT was the leading program. If you ask our internal team, they were pretty proud of what we were doing then as well. So these are always tough cultural moves when you go ahead and do something outside that you have going inside.","In the case of CardiAQ, there is a couple of things that we really like. We like their design. We like the fact that it was a different approach than FORTIS, so it gives us another option for how to attach the mitral valve. We also were really attracted to the idea that they had a single valve with multiple delivery systems. We think this can be very helpful when you are going through these long regulatory process and generating clinical data. Once you have that valve data, it oftentimes can be relevant regardless of the delivery approach. And so that's very attractive to us.","So those were some of the driving forces behind it. We think the combination of the two companies is a good one. It really is powerful and we like putting it together what it could mean for these patients.","David Lewis","And Mike, just a related question to that. Is it too early to decide whether transapical or transcatheter sort of the approach? Do you see these as different technologies for different patient populations? Or is transapical versus transcatheter point just a hedge? Or is it just too early to know?","Mike Mussallem","Well, I don't know. I think our experience in transcatheter aortic valve replacements is if you ask patients or doctors, they probably prefer a transfemoral approach over a transapical approach. Transapical has advantages because it's direct and you can have a surgeon really driving it. But in terms of the potential morbidity that's associated with it, it's still is sort of some flavor of surgery. So we think, if you actually could get to a transfemoral transseptal delivery that would be considered least invasive and preferred if you could deliver it. Now that's technically very challenging and it's one of the hurdles to clear.","David Lewis","Thank you very much.","Mike Mussallem","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills from Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Mills","Hi Mike. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on another great quarter. I go back to something, Mike, you said with respect to the U.S. TAVI market that's driving the market and perhaps driving your growth as well in terms of the centers adding capacity. Could you give us more granularity on what you mean by that in terms of what they need to do or what they are doing to add capacity and sort of that how that progresses over the course of the next couple of years to drive key growth in market?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Thanks Jason. Yes. I mean we have gotten this question in the past and your assumption is correct. The growth is coming from existing centers. Yes, we added some centers, but that really isn't the driving force behind it. We find that particularly as the new technology gets introduced and the clinicians get more experienced, they are able to do procedures faster and still have a very high level of quality. And that just adds capacity to the system. That's probably the single biggest fact. So in the same time frame that they used to do one procedure, now maybe they are doing one-and-a-half or two. And so you really get a lift. And we wonder what SAPIEN 3 will do. Our experience says that that tends to be a case that goes a little faster even than XT. So it probably introduces some capacity into the system.","Jason Mills","That's helpful. As a follow-up to that, what if anything, is happening with respect to the referral development in this market over the last year? We have seen obviously a big bump and just wondering if your centers, you are co-opting with your centers to do more on that front?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Thanks Jason. Yes, I would say most of that is being driven at the center level. We try and be helpful to them, but a lot of it is their own initiative and their own drive and we are consistently impressed with the heart teams that are out there educating their referral base and know that process just doesn't happen overnight. But I think we are seeing the effects of their commitment.","Jason Mills","Thanks. And one last one, in Europe. Could you talk about whether or not you are seeing in the registry data in your experiences there any risk creep or talk about the penetration of the intermediate risk patient population in Europe and what's going on with respect to just what bandwidth is left in Europe on the TAVI front. I will get back in queue. Thanks, Mike.","Mike Mussallem","Okay. Thanks, Jason. And again, guys. I know everybody has questions. We would like the people to hold it to two. So the contemporary data sets continue to show that the average age is above 80 and that these patients have numerous risk factors. So high-risk patients are being treated based on their EuroSCORE as well as their physician judgment that are taken into account. And so they kind of use a combination of age and frailty and comorbidities in Europe, when they are making these decisions. We just continue to see patients come off the sidelines and I guess the other indicator, Jason, is that our surgical heart valve business continues to grow very nicely. So we don't think it really is cannibalization of surgery.","Jason Mills","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Joanne Wuensch","Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Can you give us an idea a little bit of what's happening in the competitive land front in Europe? You have briefly touched on that but is there is anything else you can add to that? And then as a second question and I apologize if I missed this, the mechanics of launching SAPIEN 3 in the United States and expectations for that? Thank you.","Mike Mussallem","Okay. Thanks, Joanne. Yes, in Europe we are clearly seeing a competition increase. I would say, Edwards broadly, probably has a share gain versus last year. But we probably have taken some impact on a sequential quarter. We have Medtronic Evolut R is out there and they are gaming a little bit of attraction. We see the BSX Lotus Valve that is going to have some new sizes later in the year. They have probably gained a little share. A little bit of Symetis. So we are seeing all the players probably step up a little bit. The market share of the five smaller players probably has bumped up over the 10% level, Joanne. So it's something like that. We are continuing, in the eyes of our people, to drive a substantial price premium, maybe in the neighborhood of 20% in Europe. So that's that.","On the ramp of SAPIEN 3 in the U.S., what we have said basically is that we will be ramping up. The approval clearly came earlier than we thought. We have gotten it launched at this point. So we are off and running. We are pleased of doing that. But we are having to walk through our accounts. We have a pretty high level of confidence that we are going to have completed here before the end of the year. And so far things are tracking right on our plans.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Raj Denhoy","Thanks. Just really had one question to follow-up on mitral and CardiAQ. How much or how important is it for you in the mitral space as it develops it feet first onto the European market? And how important did the companies, CE Mark trial, the approval of the CE Mark trial factor into your acquisition?","Mike Mussallem","Well, I mean the short answer is, we have long-term aspirations to be the leader. We prefer to go first. We feel like we have a chance to have more influence and voice in the way that the regulators evaluate the technology and the way they view it. And also get a chance to be close partner with the clinicians that are engaged. So we like going early in that. That's a valuable factor to us, strategically.","Raj Denhoy","And then when you think about that trial, I know you are going to disclose more once the deal closes, but what do you envision that trial looking like and what will initial approval in Europe look like the label for the mitral valve?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. I am probably not going to help you very much, Raj, with that. Unfortunately, the way this has turned out, we announced this here before we actually have closed the transaction. And so we are just not in a position today to give detailed guidance on what it is going to mean until after the transaction closes and we get a chance to integrate those teams. You can imagine, the approach we are going to take is, we are going to try and move quickly, but we are also going to put a lot of focus on having high quality clinical studies. And so those will be factors that we will work through very carefully. But when we have something a little bit more definitive, we will be will be sharing that with you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from Leerink Swann. Please proceed with your question.","Danielle Antalffy","Thanks so much for taking the question. Good afternoon, guys. Just a follow-up on the capacity question, because we are getting this question a lot as we move into intermediate risk patients. Is there a natural ceiling at some point to the ability for these centers to add capacity? What's the next step of adding capacity? Do they have to have cath labs? Hire more another interventional cardiologist? How do you envision this unfolding as we ramp volumes into intermediate risk patients and the hospital's ability to absorb that incremental volume? And would Europe be a good proxy, because you talked to some of these high volume centers in Europe and they seem to be able to do it? But I guess I get the whole, they can do the procedure faster, but I mean, there is only so many procedures ultimately one physician can do a day. So I was just wondering how to think about that as we add intermediate risk in the coming years?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, Danielle. They are good questions. In the short term, we have seen in the past that hospitals have a tough time immediately responding to a capacity increase. That's why we think rarely in these kind rollouts, will we see a step function. They are more likely to be ramps. I think we believe that hospitals can overcome those capacity constraints. And there is a number ways that they do it. One is the procedures just take less time. So maybe in the same day when they use to get two procedures or three procedures done, they are getting four or five done. So you get a real boost on that. They can add additional teams. Sometimes actually the teams don't have to be quite as big as they used to be in the past as experience is gained. And so, we find that the SAPIEN 3 centers have a chance to really have a substantial capacity increase compared to XT. And so that's probably the single biggest factor, Danielle.","Danielle Antalffy","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And I was wondering if you could give any color on what you are seeing exiting the quarter, from a competitive environment here in the U.S., SAPIEN 3 versus Medtronic also got Evolut R approval. Any market share shifts? How do we think about the better U.S. performance? Was it faster market growth, some market share shift back in favor of Edwards, a little bit of both? Any perspective there would be great.","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Just to recap. We didn't have any SAPIEN 3 in Q2. And that's just started here in Q3. And I have tried to describe the ramp the best I could. In terms of Evolut R, they appear to be ramping as well. We don't see a real aggressive step function there. And so they are also ramping up in the quarter. There is nothing particularly noteworthy to share there, Danielle, I don't know that the competitive dynamic has been the real driver in terms of our own goals.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Navarro from RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Glenn Navarro","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. First question for Scott. Scott, you mentioned the FX impact qualitatively for 2016. But I was hoping you could help us a little bit more in terms of how we should model out 2016 with respect to the FX impact? Thanks.","Scott Ullem","It's a little early for us to give you much advice other than what we said last quarter, where there is a 200 to 250 basis points range of foreign exchange hedging contracts that are flowing through the P&L this year. And so that maybe the guideline for what may flow through the P&L next year, although again, we have got contracts that will mature. We are putting them on every month. They go about a year out. So it's tough to be more predictive than that.","Glenn Navarro","And is that purely in the gross margin?","Scott Ullem","It's purely in the gross margin. It flows straight to the bottom line.","Glenn Navarro","Okay. Great. And then just quickly in terms of data releases. SAPIEN 3 one-year data, perhaps when do we see that data and the PARTNER 2A intermediate, we are assuming ACC of next year, is that a reasonable assumption? Thanks.","Mike Mussallem","Yes. So the SAPIEN 3 one-year is, I would say, the high risk cohort. It's probably likely around TCT. We think that would be pretty good. I would say, your assumption about ACC for the P2A intermediate risk is probably a decent and safe assumption. But again, we are speculating. We don't have complete control over that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Suraj Kalia","Gentlemen, congratulations on a nice quarter.","Mike Mussallem","Thank you.","Suraj Kalia","So Mike, first of all, let me start out with Europe on the intermediate risk side. Mike, can you parse out in Europe, what does intermediate risk growth looks like for SAPIEN 3? I know it's buried within the overall numbers. Just kind of give us an idea about where it is directionally and how much more legroom it has?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Again the indication in Europe is still high risk. And that's also the indication in the U.S. Longer-term, you have a pretty good understanding probably of what would drive intermediate risk in the U.S. and you know that largely is also going to be controlled by the NCD. And we wouldn't be surprised of that same data set for intermediate risk patients have some impact in Europe. Now having said that, what's surprising, so I call your attention to is that these intermediate risk patients, they are pretty elderly patients. We are continuing to see them at age greater than 80 and all that intermediate risk is in the assumptions that we gave when we gave market size. Now I agree, things have changed since last year, but last year at the December Investor Conference, we said, hey we think it's going to be more than $3 billion market by 2019. And that included our assumptions for intermediate risk at the time.","Suraj Kalia","And there is no indication creep for intermediate risk in Europe, is what you are saying?","Mike Mussallem","No. I wouldn't call it indication creep. I tried to address it somewhat before. I think that when physicians assess, they are clearly looking at high risk patients, but they also integrate physician judgment and age and frailty and comorbidities when they do it. They are not sort of slaves to the EuroSCORE, if you will, because the definition of risk seems to be changing. Remember, that was a broad surgical definition. And now that TAVR is here, they are probably reassessing how they think about risk.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks. Great. Just two quick questions. First Mike, any update on your long-term thinking on either the number of centers that you think can have a robust TAVR program long-term? Or how you just size the global TAVR market long-term?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, Bob. Yes, I will start with the easier one, probably and then even that is difficult to assess. Probably in the U.S., we think we are probably converging on a number that looks something like 400 centers that could meet the NCD based on the way that it exists today. Our latest update on how big we think the overall market is that it's larger than $3 billion by 2019. We watch that obviously very carefully and constantly update things but probably won't have an updated look at that until we get to our Investor Conference in December.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. Fair enough. And then the second question also kind of a quick one. Your oUS TAVR revenues sequentially has been flat for three quarters. Now obviously some of that is FX. So could you just give us a little sense, especially relative to your comments that pricing has been stable? Can you give us a sense just over the last three quarters about your implant volume trends? Just want to get a sense for true underlying volume growth over the last couple of trends given that currency is distorting what we see with revenues?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, Bob. Yes, what you are saying here, clearly when you say it's not going up, you are seeing the impact of foreign exchange, which was dramatic on currencies like the Euro and the Yen. In fact, an I think we tried pretty much to report what the growth rates are. For example, in Europe, we said, hey, we believe procedure growth was around 25% and we grew somewhere in line with that. And I think that probably wasn't much different last quarter or the quarter before. So we have been probably clocking along at that 20% to 25% in Europe. And Japan is coming off a very small base. The growth rate is even higher. But probably your better benchmark is what's happening in Europe.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. I will follow-up. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Taylor","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I actually wanted to ask that question in kind of a different way. You talk a lot about the U.S. centers, but can you talk about what you see outside the U.S., in Europe, the rest of world, Japan, in terms of the ability to add centers? And any expectation there for center adds or the ultimate addressable market in terms of centers?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Thanks for your question, Matt. Japan is still ramping. So that's still going up there. I would say relatively immature. They are only a little bit more of a year into it. And I think it's going to probably take several years before they really max out. So there will be centers that get added there. And even the centers that are added are not near their capacity. In Europe, probably most of the centers exist. I know it must be in the 350 plus range of centers that exists in Europe and I think the big ones are already in place. The emerging markets are a big opportunity in the future. Again there really, it's not approved yet in China. Just approved here in the last quarter or so in India. So those big, emerging markets are just at the very front end of it. And we probably don't have enough intelligence to say how fast that's really going to take off.","Matt Taylor","Thanks. And one quick follow-up. You mentioned in the questions today that you thought you are at about a 20% premium to some of the competitors in Europe. Does that apply across the board? And are you seeing competitors use price? Clearly you have some clinical advantages to that.","Mike Mussallem","Yes. I think, basically our reports are coming from our field team and they basically are saying yes, it clearly is across-the-board and it's probably at least 20%, sometimes even more than that. And yes, you will see the difference that people will sometimes try and compensate for the difference in clinical results with price. And so it happens, but our pricing has stayed pretty stable.","Matt Taylor","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Scott, I was wondering, you had mentioned the remediation costs being a headwind on the gross margin this year. Is that something that we should think about as going away for 2016, potentially offsetting the impact of the hedges going away?","Scott Ullem","Thanks, Kristen. There have been significant manufacturing related expenses flowing to the P&L and a lot of those will continue to flow through in 2016. There were some, I will call it one-time expenses, this quarter. It was a minor part of the overall increase in manufacturing expenses. So there is going to be a fair bit that flows into 2016.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. And I guess how much do we expect this year? I guess any idea on how to think about that for next year? Is it half? Is it a quarter? Or just too early to tell?","Scott Ullem","It's too early to really get in detail. What I can tell you it some of the one-timers in the second quarter are really relating to ramping up production. And so as we are trying to get transition over to SAPIEN 3, there are incremental expenses relating to training or occurring some over time. And then we have got ongoing investments or manufacturing quality systems. So again, some of that is going to be one-time, but a good chunk of it is, probably more than half I would say, if going to flow into 2016.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. And then a last question. Just wanted to clarify. Mike I think you had said for the SAPIEN 3 high-risk or intermediate risk rather, did you say that that would be at TCT or no? Just wanted to clarify.","Mike Mussallem","Yes. We said likely that we would see at TCT. But it's too early to say. But yes, that's our thought.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, David Erickson, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please begin.","David K. Erickson - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our second quarter 2017 financial results. During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and the accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO, and Scott Ullem, CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but are limited to, financial guidance and current expectations for new product launches, clinical and regulatory timelines, reimbursement and competitive matters, trends in therapy adoption and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today.","Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in our press release, our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, all of which are available on our website at edwards.com.","Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying and adjusted, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release and our website.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thanks, David. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong performance with a remarkable growth for Edwards at both the top and bottom lines. In the quarter, we continued to be rewarded for our innovative therapies as we execute our patient-focused strategy benefiting even more patients and healthcare systems worldwide.","Strong demand for TAVR therapy resulted in total Edwards sales growth of 15% on an underlying basis. We delivered results above our expectations, which reflected strength in all three of our product lines across all regions.","In transcatheter heart valves, adjusted global sales were $510 million, up 23% on an underlying basis over prior year including an upward adjustment for the consumption of stocking inventory in Germany.","Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption across all geographies. Globally, our average selling price remained stable. In the U.S., transcatheter heart valve therapy sales for the quarter were $316 million, representing 28% growth versus the prior year. We believe overall U.S. procedure growth this quarter was consistent with our growth. Therapy adoption continued to be strong, and our SAPIEN 3 valve has sustained its excellent clinical performance across large and small valve centers.","Our growth was broadly distributed across our network, now approaching 550 hospitals with notably strong contributions from recently added centers. We continue to be encouraged by the strong international adoption of TAVR particularly where overall therapy penetration is still very low.","Outside the U.S., our underlying growth rate was 16%, which includes the consumption of $22 million of stocking inventory in Germany.","As a reminder, in the first quarter, customers in Germany purchased $62 million of additional SAPIEN 3 inventory in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from IP litigation in that country. We included these stocking sales in our reported results, but excluded them from the adjusted results in the first quarter. We will add them back to the adjusted results in subsequent quarters as this inventory has consumed to better reflect actual hospital usage.","We estimate procedure growth in Europe was in the mid-teens compared to last year. In the quarter, Edwards underlying unit growth was lower than this, reflecting a reduced share position versus a year ago. During 2017, we estimated our share position has remained stable. Growth in European countries with lower TAVR adoption rates continued to outpace countries where the therapy is more established. Consistent with historical trends, average selling prices declined slightly, which was in line with our expectations.","In Japan, our highest growth region, we continue to see strong TAVR therapy adoption with new centers being added. We believe Edwards underlying growth in the second quarter was in line with overall procedural growth in that geography.","Turning to our near-term product pipeline, we continue to expect our new Ultra system including an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology will be launched in Europe later this year. In addition, we're also pleased with the excellent early clinical trial results presented at EuroPCR on our CENTERA system. We continue to plan a limited launch of this premium self-expanding valve system in Europe late this year, and we'll use that experience to inform our U.S. strategy.","Enrollment continue to increase in our PARTNER III low risk trial, and our goal remains to have this randomized trial fully enrolled around the year-end. We're pleased that enrollment has begun in our EARLY-TAVR Trial. This groundbreaking trial is the first of its kind to study severe aortic stenosis patients without diagnosed symptoms.","In summary, as a result of the unexpectedly strong start in 2017, we are raising our full year THV underlying sales growth guidance to 20% to 25%, even as we expect competition to intensify. As a reminder, in the second half of the year, we typically experienced a seasonal slowdown.","Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy. Sales for the second quarter of $207 million were up 6% on an underlying basis. This growth benefited from the recovery of a 2016 mitral valve supply interruption that lowered last year's sales. We also experienced continued strong sales growth in the U.S. for our EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system, which more than offset the impact of the shift of surgical aortic valve procedures to TAVR.","Globally, our average selling price was higher due to the contribution of our premium INTUITY valve system. Clinician feedback on INTUITY has been very positive in our more than 200 U.S. hospitals currently offering this therapy. We're optimistic about this higher value platform and its ability to help improve the patient experience.","As recently announced, we received FDA approval for our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve and are planning a 2018 launch in the U.S. and Japan. We began launching in Europe earlier this year and have received an enthusiastic response for the use of this valve in the treatment of active patients who are seeking alternatives to mechanical valves.","In summary, as a result of the strong first half results in surgical heart valves, we now expect a higher full year underlying sales growth rate of 3% to 4%. In the clinical care product group, sales for the quarter were $147 million and grew 5% on an underlying basis. Strong performance was driven by double-digit growth in our Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, particularly in the U.S. and Asia Pacific.","Our next-generation advanced monitoring platform, HemoSphere, just recently received U.S. regulatory clearance. We are initiating the global launch of this platform, which will ramp during the remainder of the year. HemoSphere is designed to provide greater clarity on a patient's hemodynamic status to enable clinicians to make timely potentially lifesaving decisions.","HemoSphere is modular in design, and we plan to add enhanced surgical recovery capabilities to this all-in-one platform in the future. In addition, we're introducing our new FloTrac IQ smart disposables to select clinical sites in Europe. This is a low blood pressure or hypotension probability indicator to alert physicians in advance of this dangerous condition occurring. Pending regulatory approval, we plan a full launch in the U.S. and Europe in 2018. In summary, bolstered by a strong first half performance, we continue to expect full-year underlying sales growth in clinical care to be at the high end of the 5% to 7% range.","Shifting gears to our structural heart initiative, this quarter, we continue to see positive momentum in our transcatheter therapies to treat patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid disease. We're pleased to announce that we recently completed enrollment of our CE Mark trial for Cardioband in the tricuspid position.","Additionally, we've been rapidly incorporating learnings across our tricuspid portfolio. We have now treated nearly 100 patients suffering from tricuspid regurgitation with the Cardioband and FORMA systems and are encouraged by our clinical experience. These learnings are affording us valuable information as we evaluate our tricuspid launch strategy in Europe in 2018. We plan to provide more details on that at our investor conference in December.","And while we remain encouraged by Cardioband's mitral clinical results and are on track to initiate the U.S. IDE trial, the commercial ramp in Europe is progressing slower than expected as it's taken longer to build a new dedicated clinical support team. Commercial sales this quarter were minimal, and we now expect sales to grow to $2 million to $3 million in the fourth quarter. We continue to believe that annular reduction provided by Cardioband can be an important first-line repair therapy for many mitral patients.","We also have updates to report in our PASCAL transcatheter mitral valve program. We have begun enrollment in the CE Mark trial and expect to expand this trial into multiple centers over the remainder of the year. Additionally, we've just received approval to begin an early feasibility study in the U.S. We've resumed treating patients with our Edwards CardiAQ mitral valve replacement system delivered transseptally. As we gain clinical experience with this important therapy for patients who have few options, in parallel, we're applying our learnings to a more refined system and clinical protocol.","Overall, while still early, we believe our aggressive investments in research and development are well placed in the emerging transcatheter, tricuspid and mitral fields and offer the potential to help more patients and drive future growth. We're pleased with the experience we're gaining, which is providing us valuable learnings, as we continue to refine our strategy. You can expect updates on our structural heart and TAVR programs from clinicians in the upcoming fall scientific meetings.","Before we get into our financial results, I'd like to provide an update on two of our external investments. During the quarter, there was an interim review of the clinical data on the CardioKinetix Parachute device. While it showed promise in some heart failure patients, unfortunately, the trial was not likely to meet its primary endpoint and the company chose to stop the trial. As a result, we wrote off our investment this quarter.","Separately, clinical enrollment remains on track in our Harpoon Medical minimally invasive chordal repair system. Edwards has an option to acquire this technology for $100 million, plus $150 million in potential future milestone payments, and we'll likely make a decision later this year.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Hey thanks, Mike. We continued this year's strong performance with sales in the quarter of $842 million, or $864 million including $22 million of net Germany destocking, which represents an underlying growth rate of 15%. Consistent with last quarter, our underlying sales and growth rates will continue to adjust for this impact.","Our sales performance benefited from broad-based strong sales in each of our product lines and regions. We also benefited from meaningful FX rate changes since our April guidance. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 42% versus the prior year to $1.08. This earnings growth was driven by our sales performance and favorable income tax rate resulting from a larger than expected tax benefit from employee stock compensation.","GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 includes a $31 million write-off of our investment in CardioKinetix. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.","I'll now cover the details behind our results, including guidance for the remainder of the year. For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 74.9% compared to 73.3% in the same period last year. This increase was driven primarily by a more profitable product mix led by growing sales of TAVR. We continue to expect our full year gross profit rate, excluding special items, to be between 74% and 76%.","Second quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7% over the prior year to $244 million or 29% of sales. The increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expenses related to transcatheter valves. The ratio of SG&A as a percentage of sales would have been 80 basis points lower, adjusting for the impact of Germany destocking sales. We continue to expect full year SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 28% and 29% of sales, as we increase SG&A spending in the second half of the year.","Research and development investments in the quarter increased 19% over the prior year period to $134 million or 16% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral, aortic and tricuspid valve programs including development expenses associated with Cardioband. As with the SG&A ratio, the R&D ratio would have been 40 basis points lower without the Germany destocking sales.","We continue to expect our research and development investments, excluding special items, to be between 16% and 17% of sales for the full year as we increase R&D investments in the second half of the year, while enrollment and clinical trials increases. During the second quarter, we recorded $8 million in intellectual property litigation related expenses, which have been excluded from adjusted earnings per share consistent with our convention. These expenses related primarily to IP litigation in the U.S. and Europe.","Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 9.5% compared to 25.1% in the prior year period. This quarter's rate benefited from the new accounting for employee stock-based compensation. Without this benefit, earnings per share would have been $0.13 lower. As we mentioned at our investor conference, this accounting benefit will fluctuate in each reporting period, making period comparisons less consistent.","Our benefit in the first half of 2017 has exceeded our estimate driven primarily by our higher stock price, which results in a higher tax deduction. We now expect our full year GAAP tax rate to be between 17% and 19%. Excluding the excess tax benefit and special items, our full year tax rate would be consistent with our prior guidance of 22% to 23%.","Forecasting remains difficult, because stock option exercises and stock price are not predictable. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted second quarter sales by $10 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now estimate an approximate $20 million negative impact to full year 2017 sales versus the prior year. Our previous estimate was $50 million. Compared to our April guidance, foreign exchange rates had less than a $0.01 impact on earnings per share in the second quarter.","Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $140 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $198 million, less capital spending of $58 million. Our capital spending reflects investments we are making to increase valve manufacturing capacity. Given our strong operating performance in the first half of this year, we now expect our full year free cash flow to be between $625 million and $675 million.","During the first half of 2017, we opportunistically repurchased 5.4 million shares for $511 million to more than offset dilution associated with our Valtech acquisition and stock-based incentive compensation. Average shares outstanding during the second quarter declined to 215.7 million. We have over $500 million for share repurchase available under our current authorization, and we continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for the year of 216 million to 218 million. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.1 billion, and total debt was $1 billion.","Turning to our 2017 guidance. Given our strong start to the year, we are raising our full year sales estimate to be at the high end of our previous range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. This higher estimate reflects the stronger than expected first half performance and a weaker U.S. dollar. We continue to expect our underlying growth rate to moderate in the second half.","Our expectation is that hospitals in Germany fully utilize their stocking inventory by the end of the year, which result in no impact to full year results. Our full year guidance for transcatheter heart valve therapy sales is at the high end of $1.7 billion to $2 billion and for critical care, at the high end of $560 million to $600 million.","We are raising our sales guidance for surgical heart valve therapy to be between $780 million and $810 million. Given our strong first half sales performance and favorable tax rate, we now expect our full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be between $3.65 and $3.85, up from $3.43 to $3.55. This includes increased SG&A and our research and development expenses in the second half of 2017.","For the third quarter of 2017, our seasonally lowest quarter at current foreign exchange rates, we project underlying sales to be between $810 million and $850 million, and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.80 and $0.90.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thank you, Scott. As we reflect on our first half results, we're very pleased with the performance achieved across all our product lines and believe our future remains bright. Our innovative TAVR therapies continue to deliver value to patients. Our surgical heart valve and critical care product lines remain strong, as we invest in innovative products to strengthen our leadership positions.","And our transcatheter mitral and tricuspid valve technologies continue to represent exciting opportunities for breakthrough therapies. Overall, we're confident that our valuable innovations will result in a continued strong outlook as we deliver important solutions for the patients that we serve.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to David.","David K. Erickson - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thank you, Mike. Before we open up for questions, I encourage you to mark your calendars for Thursday, December 7, when we will be hosting our 2017 Investor Conference in New York. This event will include updates on our latest technologies as well as our outlook for 2018. More information will be available in the next couple of months.","In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue, and we'll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the hour.","Operator, we're ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks and congratulations on a really strong first half. My first question this afternoon is, I just wondered if I could get some clarifications on your comments on the pipeline. So regarding, Ultra and CENTERA outside the United States, are there any changes to the previous timelines that you've articulated? And then, on mitral replacement, I think your previous comments were that you hope to be commercial in 2019 and that you're screening patients. But I noticed you talked about a more refined system and more refined clinical protocol, so maybe if you could just give us a thorough update on mitral and Ultra and CENTERA. Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Well, thanks a lot, Bob. Appreciate your comments. Yeah, actually the guidance on CENTERA and Ultra is unchanged. That's consistent with what we said before. So, Ultra will be launching later this year, and CENTERA will be launching actually late in the year, and so that really is no change. And we're optimistic about both of those platforms being really important and valuable to customers.","On the marginal side rather than go through all our micro programs, maybe I'll just restrict my comments to the CardiAQ product line. As you correctly noted, we said last quarter to expect a 2019 launch. Nothing has changed in that regard. What we are pleased to announce is we actually began implants again. Remember we were very deliberate about this.","We're doing implants again, which not only helps these patients that really don't have many options, but it also allows us to learn which is really important. And it helps us not only in the design of our product, but also in the selection of patients and the procedure itself and understanding anticoagulation protocol and a long list that becomes important for the long-term success of this therapy.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's very helpful. And then the second question, I just wanted to ask about the TAVR performance in Europe. You made some comments about growth in the market and then your growth and your share position. I was wondering if you could just provide any additional color on what you're seeing in Europe and you said you maybe lost a little bit of share in Europe. Just maybe a little more color there would be appreciated. Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thanks, Bob. You do a pretty good job of packing a lot into a couple of questions. Anyways, what we've tried to say is in the Europe that we estimated the market probably grew in the mid-teens, we grew less than that. And so actually that reflects a market share reduction versus a year ago. We also tried to suggest that there was really no market share change in 2017, so this really lapsed back to a period in time, when there was increased competitive activities. But we're very pleased with the way things are going overall in Europe.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on another good quarter. One financial for Scott, one big picture question for Mike. Scott, how much of the $0.26 EPS raise at the midpoint is due to the stock-based comp benefit, how much is operational, and should we use that 17% to 19% tax rate going forward? And then I have one follow-up for Mike.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So on 17% to 19%, that's the right estimate for the full year. And so if you average out the little bit lower 9% rate this quarter, it gets you a little bit higher rate for the back end of the year. In terms of the EPS, an increase for the rest of the year, it's about 60% operations, 40% excess tax benefit resulting from the stock-based compensation accounting change.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Scott, I meant beyond 2017 and while I'm on that for the \u2013 17% to 19%, that sounds like that's probably the best rate to use at this point. And then Mike, 2017 is shaping up to be another strong year obviously for Edwards. Given that the low risk indication isn't expected until probably late 2019, is there enough runway, any intermediate risk, in your pipeline to drive strong growth until you receive a low-risk indication? Nothing specific, but just directionally, how you're thinking about between now and the low-risk indication? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","So, Larry, I'll try to answer your question about tax rate. If there were no excess tax benefit, think about our baseline tax rate for now as low 20% range. It's really hard to estimate beyond that, what the impact's going to be on this excess tax benefit, because there are three elements that contribute to the calculation. One is the number of stock options that are exercised. Two is the strike price of those options that are exercised and the third one is our stock price.","And so, to give you much color beyond just that baseline, tax rate reference really isn't possible at this point. We'll talk more about it at the investor conference, when we give guidance in December for 2018.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","And thanks, Larry. From a big picture perspective in TAVR, yeah, we enjoyed a terrific first half, that's for sure. We expect a really strong second half, although the growth rate is going to be lower, probably more consistent with what we originally thought.","We're not prepared to give long-term guidance at this point, other than to remind you that we've said we believe this market is more than $5 billion and that we expect to be the leader going forward. If you just sort of play that out, Edwards would sustain a growth rate that would be somewhere in the teens, right, and it depends on the year, it's just exactly where it is, whether it's mid-teens or low teens. But no, we don't expect there to be a big drop. It will obviously change from quarter-to-quarter. We're always subject to volatilities, which I think you should be cautious of, but now, we feel good about our runway.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for talking my questions, guys.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, and good afternoon everybody. Just two product questions on my end. So, one, Mike, with CENTERA is what is the limiting factor beyond wanted to have a good initial experience from going from a trialing, kind of limited rollout to a broader rollout. When would you expect the broader rollout to occur?","And then on the Cardioband MR commentary, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that it's taking longer to build out a support team. Could you just expand on that? That sounds a little surprising just given your wealth of experience on the TAVR side.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. And first of all, on CENTERA, there is nothing fundamental that's an obstacle there, Mike, that you need to be concerned about. We're going to go through the normal scale-up even though we have some outstanding results in the CE Mark trial. Again, it's hundreds of patients, and we want to execute this at a high level. We already have a heart valve in the marketplace by the name of SAPIEN 3 that's performing at an extraordinarily high level. And so, we don't feel the urgency that we have to rush CENTERA, and we're just going to be deliberate about it in terms of ramping it up. Our production ramp and our training is something that we'll do, we feel comfortable with, and so, no special news or limitations in that regard.","On Cardioband, it's just a matter of us putting a dedicated team in place. We've made the decision that we are going to have a dedicated team and not trying to get leverage out of our transcatheter aortic valve team or our heart valve team, but have a dedicated team for this. We're building that right now. It's taken us a little bit longer than we like. So we're probably still building that during the second quarter and expect that to be effective and start to ramp up in the third and start hitting our stride here in the fourth quarter. So it has taken us longer than we like, but I think it's the matter of this development, and I think it's a little bit of what to expect here as we ramp some of these future therapies.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Then just one financial follow-up for Scott. So Scott, if I look at the first half of the year, your incremental operating margin was 50% on your sales. The guidance for the back half to the year implies a pretty good step-down from that type of drop-through. But can you just talk about where incremental spending might go in the second half of the year that would drive that?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah, sure. So in the second half of the year, our expenses are actually going to grow probably two times the rate of sales growth, and it's really driven in research and development by continuing increases in clinical trials and timing on SG&A expenses and just building up SG&A to support some of these new initiatives that we've talked about in the transcatheter, mitral, and tricuspid areas.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much. Two market questions for you, Mike. The first is, I wonder if you could help us think about the U.S. picture in the second half relative to the first half. I think in the first half, Mike, you talked about faster center starts and less competitive impact in the U.S. How should we think about the ex-U.S. experience? Are we expecting competition to sort of heat back up, and how should we think about center adds in the second half? And I had a quick follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So a bunch of questions in there, David. Let me see if I can take it apart. We still think we're going to have a robust growing U.S. market. In terms of growth, yes, we think centers will continue to be added. We don't think there'll be anything unusual, probably consistent with past trends. From a competitive point of view, we expect that to intensify. Got to recall that we had a competitor that just got an intermediate risk approval recently. And so, we would expect that to have some kind of impact in the marketplace.","And then, the other thing, and maybe the most important factor is remember, there was some pretty terrific growth in TAVR procedures in the U.S. during 2016, a pretty aggressive ramp. And some of that actually was the movement from surgery to TAVR. That sort of starts moderating to some extent in 2017, and so you wouldn't expect the same kind of growth from that driver in the back half that you saw in the front half.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Mike. And then just a similar question, but ex-U.S. I mean it's interesting. By our math, your ex-U.S. business actually had a momentum acceleration in the quarter, but yet you called out the expected share loss in the European market. So I wonder, is the bridge Japan, which didn't come up in the call so far. How is Japan going, and was that the source of sort of outperformance versus our estimates here in the second quarter? Thanks so much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks. Japan is certainly a factor. I think what we said in our commentary is that those countries where TAVR is lightly penetrated really had accelerated growth and Japan is a perfect example of that, but it also was true in countries across Europe and even other countries in Asia. So yes, indeed the international growth is significant, not just in Europe, and yeah, even with the share loss, and some of that share loss is something that we fully anticipated and expect over time.","Again it's not something that's happening to us so much in 2017, but historical in nature. We think we're able to put some pretty good growth numbers on the board and mostly attributable to the fact that adoption is still early in these. Japan for example is a place where we're probably still only treating high-risk patients. And so, we got quite a runway in front of us for us to be able to grow and that adoption there is still slower and it started later than in the big markets like Europe and the U.S.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, Mike. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me, okay?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Hear you great, Jason.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Super. Congrats on another great quarter. I wanted to stick with David's question on centers. And I guess more specifically, Mike, in 550 U.S. centers now, what changes if anything in your approach to new centers in the United States? And I guess, are you dealing with any different dynamics than you've been dealing with in the past as you go forward with center expansion? And maybe you could comment on any contemporary data you've collected or seen on length of stay as a contributing factor to new centers' ability to build programs?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So, so big picture, yes, as TAVR has developed and matured, it's become apparent to centers that if you want to be a real player in treating patients with the aortic stenosis that you need to have a transcatheter heart valve program. So, you can imagine the incentive for hospitals to add programs. There are significant hurdles and there are payment hurdles that they have to overcome. So, we expect hospitals to continue to add that.","What we saw that what \u2013 it's happened for a few quarters now, is these new centers that joined are having almost immediate impact on our growth rate. So, if you look at where the growth is coming from the U.S., there is a significant portion that it's not just coming from the big centers, although those are certainly growing, but the new centers that are added.","And so, that's been interesting. And it helps you get a sense for just the learning curve associated with SAPIEN 3. It's a relatively short one. They're able to perform at a pretty high level. The other thing it probably says is that there is patients out there that are in their own networks. And so, as hospitals join, it's a chance for them actually to be treated. And even though there might have been a center not far from them, they might have never found their way to that center, if it wasn't added. And it's a bit of a signal here of what's in front of us here to make sure this therapy actually gets expanded.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","So that's \u2013 segue into the second part of that question. As you look at the second half of the year and into 2018, I know a question was asked about growth between now and the approval for a low risk in 2019. How much will you rely on new centers and efficiency gains, productivity gains at existing centers to achieve double-digit growth over the next sort of six quarters?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","We still think that the hospitals that are currently treaters are going to be the lion's share of the growth and that continues to expand. And I think you know from our past discussions that we feel like the treatment rate of patients with severe aortic stenosis and symptoms is still quite low. So, these hospitals can handle the volume and they're continuing to mature and they're continuing to develop their referral network and that's going to be the primary source of our growth. We've been pleased this is \u2013 I guess we were approved in the U.S. in 2011. So you can see how many years we're into it and still have a pretty heavy growth rate, and so, we feel comfortable that growth is going to stay significant into the foreseeable future.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Please proceed.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. So I had a follow-up on mitral and tricuspid and then just one follow-up on \u2013 just last question on centers. So, Mike, if you could expand a little bit on you mentioned some of the learnings and you described earlier related to Cardioband, it may be pertaining to the duration of the procedure if that's part of what you're able to take away from those, and on mitral, the impact of this valve-in-valve label expansion for SAPIEN 3. And as I mentioned I have one follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Okay. So, well, a couple of things. First of all, on Cardioband, remember that there is a mitral program and we already have a CE Mark approval. So, we are expanding that and we're about to initiate the U.S. IDE trial. And then separately what we announced is that we completed enrollment of the CE Mark trial for Cardioband in the tricuspid position. And so when I talked about our learnings, part of what I was trying to share was that we've learned a lot about tricuspids over the recent past.","And so not that we are not learning a lot on mitrals, but I was just calling that out as a fact. Between Cardioband and FORMA, we have now over 100 patients \u2013 we've treated nearly 100 patients that are suffering from tricuspid regurgitation. We have learned a lot and that's going to help us refine our strategy because we're thinking deeply about what we would launch in Europe in 2018 and I was more reflecting on that. The second part of the question?","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","On mitral valve-in-valve, SAPIEN 3?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Valve, there was valve-in-valve. Yeah. Yeah, this is an important point from a patient perspective. So, for patients, we don't see these patients very often, but they are in desperate need, and a transcatheter valve inside of a failing valve is very powerful for these patients and potentially lifesaving. In terms of what it does for our numbers, it's not very significant. It's actually a small part and when you consider the size of the transcatheter aortic valve business, it's not a meaningful driver of growth.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then the second on the centers and the progress that you've seen there. I guess a follow-up to this last question. Is there a seasonal cycle to these centers? It seems like this time last year, there was a lot of new centers starting up and then, the first half of this year, many of those centers are really contributing. So is there a seasonality to that, is there a size metric that you used to talk about the centers as being kind of on the smaller, newer size to add annual volumes or any color you can provide around that expansion.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks. I think I understand the question. When we talk about seasonality, we talk about the normal seasonality that affects all of Edwards business, particularly surgeries. We know for example, in the third quarter, this is a higher vacation season for a lot of our treaters and volume is low, and in the fourth quarter, we have holidays that affect us as well. But I'm not sure that we see an impact related to centers that are becoming new TAVR centers that there is a seasonal impact. There may be some level of that, but it's not one that we're prepared to call out.","The thing that probably that's more meaningful is the impact of these new sites are having immediately because even though \u2013 and you'd have to acknowledge that most of the centers that are being added are smaller centers, they must have a captive patient population. And so, as they do join, we get an impact immediately in the TAVR procedures. So it probably speaks somewhat to the point that patients don't naturally flow across hospital systems, and it probably highlights the importance of that and why new centers are meaningful.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Just hoping for a comment on the pricing backdrop. If I look at your comments regarding the share trend Europe and then compare that to margins, it looks like pricing has been very stable, but just that that in fact has been the case.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So, we spoke to pricing from a couple of dimensions. One is, overall pricing ASP for the globe, we said that's very stable, and remember that has a product mix in it with probably higher pricing in places like Japan and the U.S. and lower in Europe. We said there is some impact on pricing, that's pretty minimal and I characterize it as low single digit, both in Europe and even lower in the U.S. related to volume discounting, but other than that, it's been quite a stable pricing picture.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And is it fair to say that you expect that pricing trend to remain stable into 2018, as the competitive dynamic evolves? And maybe separate from that, if you could just give us a sense on CENTERA. I'm interested in, whether or not you guys might give us a little more color on your U.S. strategy at the December analyst meeting or might that be more of a 2018 event? Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. So, in terms of what we're going to do with our pricing going forward, yeah, we think pricing is going to be pretty solid. We really don't have anything to share, it's different. There is a pretty significant price premium that we're enjoying in Europe at this point, and if anything, it seems like it's growing, but it hasn't had a lot of impact on us at this point. And it certainly varies by country.","We talk about CENTERA pricing, we haven't announced that yet. It's just likely to be a little different by country. It's a premium product and will be positioned that way. And in terms of the launch plan for CENTERA in the U.S., yeah, we'll probably have more to say about it at our investor conference. At this point, what we really want to do is to gain some more experience in the U.S. \u2013 I mean in Europe with the CENTERA system to help and form that strategy.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you, guys.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure, Isaac.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, I have two questions, one on mitral, one tricuspid. On mitral, it looks like mitral could go in, will post around $500 million more white sale this year. And I was just wondering, how in your mind does PASCAL stack up to that product?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","We ask ourselves the same questions, Bruce. It's pretty early at this point. We've got very limited number of implants. We're optimistic about it. We get nice feedback from our clinicians. They're clearly excited about it, but it's too early to say really how competitive it is.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then on tricuspid, we count a lot of patients in the U.S. You seem excited about the opportunity, part's Cardioband, part's FORMA. Could you just convey the basis for your excitement and why Cardioband perhaps might do better in the tricuspid application?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So, we're fortunate to have a portfolio in the tricuspid position that includes more than one therapy. And it's too early for us to declare one of the therapies better than the others. What we've learned is that, it is a real opportunity that patients just don't have many options. And so, physicians are enthusiastic to be able to have something to help patients.","What's not clear in the tricuspid position is whether we can have any long-term lasting impact, but we believe certainly that we're hearing about an improvement in their quality of life that comes pretty rapidly. So, there is still lots of questions, Bruce, for us to answer, but we get encouraged by clinicians to persist on this. And we're glad to be able to gain experience at this point, so that we could sort through what is our sort of lead play in Europe in 2018 and we would probably have more to say about that at the investor conference.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Mike, the strength in the heart valve therapy business this quarter was nice to see. I know you guys do have some easy comps because of what happened on the mitral side last year, but it also sounds like INTUITY was a big factor and maybe exceeding our expectations. Can you just quantify that at all for us either in terms of the percentage of sales or procedures INTUITY represents today or maybe how the non-INTUITY piece of the business is doing?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. So we were clearly pleased with what was happening. In terms of the recovery, that was probably more than half of the total growth came from the recovery of mitral position, but INTUITY was a real contributor, probably added two points of growth to the product line in the quarter.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, how you're thinking about the launch dynamics around SAPIEN Ultra? Is your expectation an Ultra replaces SAPIEN 3 the same way we saw SAPIEN 3 replaced XT or are you guys going to try and position a little differently?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. We think that ultimately \u2013 I shouldn't have used the choice of words that Ultra will replace SAPIEN 3. We think it will be a next-generation platform and that our customers will prefer and that they will all migrate in that direction.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Congratulations on the nice quarter here. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, maybe on the TAVR guidance, I know you've raised it to 20% to 25% for the year. I'm just curious, does it now assume your TAVR business is growing in line with the market rate of growth? Or if not, I'm just curious as to the reasoning.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. No, I think that's not bad. That's probably pretty consistent with the growth of the market. We think that the competitive dynamic is going to increase in the back half of the year. So for example, we have mentioned that a competitor has intermediate risk. So we might grow slightly slower than the growth of the U.S. market. But in the first half of the year, we probably have been very consistent with the market and in the back half, maybe been slightly slower.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thanks. And then maybe one follow-up for Scott. In Cardioband, I know, originally when you guys gave the guidance, we had sort of expected $10 million to $15 million contribution on the revenues and $0.10 of dilution. I mean, just given how that business has trended, are we to assume the dilution, the impact would be higher? Can you just give us some color, Scott?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. We think that the revenues are going to come in below the $10 million to $15 million than we thought originally for the year. And as a result, the dilution may be a little bit more. We feel pretty positive about the ramp, that by the time we get to Q4, we're expecting low single digits, $2 million or $3 million in revenue and over time, this should make positive contributions and work out of the dilutive position that is in here in the initial quarters.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good evening, gentlemen. Thanks a lot. I was hoping to ask on the international TAVR franchise in Europe specifically. With the TAVR, worldwide TAVR guidance bump, was the expectation for Europe's share to be stable throughout the year as it experience in the first half and is there any incremental competitive challenge from Symetis being over Boston Scientific's roof and in their sales force's hands in your view?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Josh. I think I heard you. You're coming through a little bit muffled, but right now, we don't expect much change in terms of the competitive dynamics in Europe in the second half of the year. Of course, we have a lot of respect for Boston, but we haven't modeled that there is a big change in terms of what the Symetis performance will be in the second half.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. And then just on the U.S. TAVR performance in Q2, were there any one-timers, either headwinds or tailwinds, either on clinical revenues or cap programs ending by from competitors? Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Okay. I'm not sure I understood. Can you say that one more time Vijay, or Josh, I'm sorry.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","No problem. In the 2Q performance in U.S. TAVR, were there any one-timers, either tailwinds or headwinds? I know some of the things we were thinking about where on clinical revenue with a low risk trial pace picking up where some of your competitors' cap programs I believe ended, Boston Scientific's, I think Medtronic's ended prior to the end of 2Q?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Clinical revenues weren't, I think, a big contributor. I think the kind of things we already talked about, the fact that the new centers contributed to growth. We probably didn't feel much competitive impact in the second quarter not as much as we anticipated. We think that will probably step up. International growth is probably a little bit better. But the other one that I always like to remind us of is just how difficult it is to predict this business precisely. With 550 hospitals and a TAVR device costing about $30,000, if you do one more or one less procedure in the quarter, that's a $16.5 million swing. So, just a reminder that we try and dial this in pretty closely, but it's difficult sometime to predict.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hello. Hi. Good afternoon, guys. My first question, Mike, U.S. market, U.S. TAVR market, very strong once again, and all our channel checks suggests that we're finally starting to see the pull-through on the intermediate risk patient population. So, my question, Mike, is, is there any way you can quantify how the intermediate risk indication is impacting U.S. volumes? Thanks. And then I had a follow-up on CardiAQ.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. A few things. One is, we think that the intermediate risk indication is going to be probably a slow developing trend, that it's going to take time for practice to really change over time. We think there was some encouragement to switch from surgery to TAVR, and we saw sort of some pretty good movement from surgery to TAVR during 2016. But I think that growth rate has slowed down in our minds in 2017. So, I think we're probably back on sort of this change ramp, if you will, of how long it takes for therapy change to really become part of practice. And that's why we think frankly TAVR growth is going to continue for some time to come.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So, in other words, most of the implants that you saw in 2Q, you believe were extreme risk and high risk and still not a lot of impact from intermediate risk. Is that fair?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","I don't know if that's fair. We've tried to move away from this purely a risk conversation because as we know age is a significant factor as well. So there is probably a lot of elderly patients that might even been characterized as intermediate risk that join that, but I think more and more, there is an acknowledgment that it's not just purely risk and we caution you not to just rely on that as a single factor.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just my follow-up on CardiAQ. Mike, you said earlier in the call that you're back to implanting patients. Are you implanting patients in your CE Mark trial or are these patients you're implanting in the U.S. feasibility study? And the reason I'm asking is obviously the CE Mark trial is key to getting the CardiAQ valve on the market in 2019. Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. And I think primarily, we're enrolling here right now where we started here with our EFS trial in the U.S. The CE Mark depends on some roll-in patients, and so ultimately, we expect that to pick up momentum, but that we're not trying to signal that that's off and running yet.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And the EU trial, you do assume it does start enrolling at some point later this year?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","I would think so. I think really the benchmark we put out there is that we'd like to think that we get this valve CE Marked by 2019 and so, we're on a path we think to do that.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. I think on the first quarter call, I asked you about gross margins because they had stepped up really nicely, and then they did so again in the second quarter. Before we all start modeling this as a go-forward rate, could you please give us an idea of, is this really a go-forward rate and how much of the benefit year-over-year came from things like FX versus mix, versus maybe something else?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","So yeah, in the second quarter for the first time in a while, FX had a negligible impact versus last year and really the THV growth was reflected in most of that 160 basis point improvement. It might have been about 10 basis points from mix. The other thing that's I think changed from years past is we had very little impact from investment in operations in the second quarter. Now, we do expect that that will ramp up a little bit in the second half, but most of the gross margin improvement you saw was due to THV mix.","Again, just in terms of going forward, the modeling assumption that we've been recommending is somewhere in the mid 70% range, call it 75%, which is right in the middle of this year's gross profit range. And we'll talk about how that may change as we continue to gain experience, making these investments in valve capacity around the world and continue to see how these new products come to market, what kind of gross margin performance they deliver as well.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. And as a follow-up, you raised your free cash flow guidance for 2017, which is really nice, but what do you plan on doing with all the cash? Thank you.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","So, our first call on cash is just to invest in internal R&D platforms. But when we get down to actual free cash flow, really we're going to look at continuing to fund external investments and look into things like investing in minority positions in earlier stage companies, making acquisitions as well, though you shouldn't expect that we're going to be doing any bet the ranch transformational kinds of acquisitions. After that, we really look to share repurchase as the means of delivering capital back to shareholders, and I think we feel good about our long-term performance including recently on being opportunistic about buying back stock in the open market.","And so, this higher cash flow isn't exactly a can of corn, but we feel pretty good about being able to generate good cash off of the income statement this year, and we're going to be very disciplined in making sure we're deploying it intelligently.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Gillings with JMP Securities. Please proceed.","John T. Gillings - JMP Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to get some additional color on the Ultra system. Given the on-balloon design, the attributes of the Axela sheath and with more TAVR devices coming and outcomes in TAVR generally being pretty good, could you just help us understand how these things will impact the user experience, as that may become more important to physicians' decisions going forward? Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks. We do think the Ultra will improve the physician experience. I think it should lend itself to a simpler procedure as we take stems out. It mistake-proofs it, allows it to be faster, so real improvements there. And then we'd like to think ultimately that leads to good patient results as well. Right?","John T. Gillings - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up to that, stroke rates are obviously already extremely low but there has been a recent FDA approval for cerebral protection device, so there is still some interest there. Would any of the attributes of the Axela sheath potentially reduce debris or is that already so low that that's not really on the radar screen right now?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. This is not really important factor in our mind. We think the sheath is primarily about vascular complication, is not a serious contributor to stroke. And in terms of embolic protection, I think we're already on the record saying that we're not sure that embolic protection really makes SAPIEN 3's performance improve. The matter of fact, even the data that was generated in that earlier trial did not demonstrate that to be true, so we have trouble thinking that there is going to be much impact.","John T. Gillings - JMP Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, guys, and congrats on the quarter.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Please proceed.","Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, gentlemen. Congrats on the quarter. So Mike, two questions. First of all most, I heard in your prepared remarks you talk about CardiAQ that these patients had few options. I guess what I'm trying to understand, Mike, is are you honing in on a subset of the patients, MR 4 plus (61:47), failed MitraClip, or just curious about your commentary about these patients having few options.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. I think we would acknowledge at this point that these patients are at high risk. In many cases physicians consider them non-operable. If they had other good choices for them, they would use conventional therapies. So you'd almost argue that we're in a compassionate group of patients at this point and that's where we started to try and have \u2013 really to help the patients that are in greatest need. Is that clear? Yeah.","Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.","That's fair enough.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thanks.","Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.","And Mike, the second one, in terms of your Cardioband mitral team, what specific skill sets are you looking for this dedicated Cardioband team and was this sort of decided upfront, when you all acquired Cardioband? I'm just trying to understand what changed on the ground that now you all feel. You know what, it's better to have a 50 men or 20 men sales team, just for Cardioband. Thank you for taking my questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. It's a small team. I think Cardioband had a contract to team, we've got a dedicated Edwards team that we're putting in place. These are clinical specialists that are in the procedures. They actually do training, they do proctoring, they actually try and help these clinicians in these very early procedures get outstanding clinical outcomes.","And so, it's not big hiring, because we're in targeted countries at this point, but we think that the potential for this procedure is and the opportunity is significant enough that we wanted a focused and dedicated team that could grow with the procedure.","Operator","Thank you.

These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today.","Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in our press release, our 2017 annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, all of which are available on our website at Edwards.com.","Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying, organic and adjusted, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release and our website.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thank you, David. We're pleased to report strong second quarter performance that delivered double digit organic sales growth driven by robust sales of our innovative therapies. Total adjusted sales of $972 million grew 10% on an underlying basis, consistent with our expectations and in line with our 10% to 11% underlying full year growth forecast.","We experienced broad-based growth across the Edwards portfolio. Bigger picture, structural heart disease is largely undertreated and underdiagnosed and we remain committed to increasing awareness and providing innovative life-saving therapies so even more patients can benefit.","In transcatheter heart valve therapies, second quarter global sales were $585 million. Underlying sales were up over 12% compared to the prior year, which reflects strong organic growth, partially offset by lower royalty revenues. Our global average selling price increased slightly as a result of favorable country mix.","We estimate global TAVR procedures continue to grow in the mid-teens while our growth globally was a bit lower due to share decline outside the U.S. In the U.S., total procedures for the second quarter grew in the mid-teens versus the prior year, and our growth was comparable. Strong therapy adoption continued to fuel procedure growth across a broad spectrum of TAVR centers in the network of approximately 600 hospitals.","As physicians presented at TVT last month, evidence continues to show a large number of diagnosed patients who are not being treated for aortic stenosis. We are introducing new capabilities to help U.S. hospitals properly identify patients and streamline the care pathway to enable an efficient patient management process.","We still expect the limited Continued Access Protocol, or CAP, for our U.S. PARTNER 3 Trial to begin in the third quarter, and we continue to anticipate data from the PARTNER 3 Trial to be presented at the ACC meeting in March of 2019, followed by the receipt of a low risk indication late that year.","Yesterday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services convened a panel to consider procedural volume requirements for TAVR programs. This panel listened to presentations from a wide range of stakeholders including Edwards. CMS will take the panel's comments along with other inputs into consideration as it shapes the updated National Coverage Determination, or NCD. We expect this to be finalized sometime over the next year. We have confidence in the thoughtful process, and our positive outlook on long-term TAVR opportunity is unchanged.","Outside the U.S., procedures showed continued impressive growth estimated to be in the mid-teens. We continue to see excellent long-term opportunities for growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR therapy is still relatively low. Our underlying sales growth this quarter was around 10%.","In Europe, we're impressed that TAVR procedures continue to grow in the double digits across nearly every country even after more than 10 years since the therapy introduction. With the advances of low profile systems, we've seen the expected decline in our TA platform which was significant this quarter. We have maintained price discipline and ceded share to competitors who have chosen to price aggressively in this region.","While our SAPIEN 3 valve continues to demonstrate best-in-class clinical performance, we look forward to reinforcing our leadership position with the introduction of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra and CENTERA valves later this year.","In Japan, our highest growth region, we continue to see strong TAVR therapy adoption with several new centers being added.","We continue to enroll patients in this small clinical trial of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra System to supplement our European regulatory submission and remain on track to receive a CE Mark later this year. This same valve system is also on track to gain U.S. regulatory approval in late 2018.","We have completed a minor modification to the delivery system of our self-expanding CENTERA valve. We plan to continue the commercial introduction and commence our U.S. pivotal trial late in the third quarter.","In summary, we continue to expect our 2018 THVT underlying sales growth rate to be at the higher end of 11% to 15%, aided by new TAVR and TMTT platforms in the fourth quarter. There are many patients who would benefit from TAVR who are not diagnosed or treated today, and we're encouraged that the TAVR opportunity remains robust. And we're confident in our ability to maintain a strong leadership position as this opportunity grows to over $5 billion by 2021.","In Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, adjusted sales for the second quarter of $219 million were up 3% on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of the consignment conversion. Once again, our new premium aortic valve products drove underlying sales growth faster than the total procedure growth.","We were pleased to see adoption of our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve accelerate during the second quarter. This valve is designed to be an attractive option for active patients, and we've observed a trend of physicians treating younger patients in our early experience. We continue to expect to introduce this new class of resilient tissue valves in Japan this year, pending reimbursement approval, and adoption of our INTUITY Elite valve system in the U.S. contributed to our growth again in the second quarter.","We are examining the root cause of the complications in specific Harpoon patients discovered last quarter and will update our introduction plans once completed. We do not expect that this will have a material impact on our 2018 surgical heart valve sales and remain optimistic about this novel therapy to treat degenerative mitral valve regurgitation.","In summary, in Surgical Heart Valve Therapy we continue to expect full year 2018 underlying sales growth of 2% to 4%. Even as TAVR adoption expands, we are excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and to extend our leadership in surgical heart valve technologies.","In Critical Care, sales for the quarter were $169 million and grew 12% on an underlying basis. This performance was driven by strong growth across our product lines, led primarily by HemoSphere. Additionally, sales in the U.S. were uniquely strong this quarter aided by new GPO contracts.","HemoSphere, our next generation all-in-one monitoring platform, continues to receive excellent feedback from clinicians and is expected to be an important growth driver in 2018 and beyond. As a reminder, HemoSphere offers clinicians an intuitive, simple-to-use touchscreen platform that provides a patient's hemodynamic status.","We continue to plan to introduce our Acumen Hypotension Prediction Index, or HPI, to a limited number of hospitals utilizing our current platform until it becomes available on HemoSphere later this year. Our HPI algorithm was recently acknowledged in the peer-reviewed journal, Anesthesiology. It concluded that in 84% of surgical cases, HPI predicted potential dangerously low blood pressure 15 minutes before it occurred.","In summary, we continue to expect full year 2018 underlying sales growth in Critical Care to be at the higher end of 6% to 8%, and we remain confident in our innovation strategy in this market-leading product line.","Turning to our transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies, or TMTT, we continue to invest aggressively in this portfolio and believe we are well positioned to address this opportunity as there are millions of patients without effective treatment options. We're encouraged by the progress on each of our programs, and today I will cover some select updates.","Beginning with the transcatheter mitral repair, patients are being treated commercially with Cardioband, and we're encouraged by the high level of interest from clinicians in its potential. We believe that this platform advances \u2013 we believe that as this platform advances the annular reduction provided by Cardioband can be an important first-line therapy for many mitral patients.","The ongoing integration into Edwards' supply chain is making good progress but continues to constrain supply in both the mitral and tricuspid programs which limited second quarter sales to approximately $1 million. We continue to target a ramp in TMTT sales in the second half to reach approximately $15 million for the full year of 2018.","Enrollment in the CLASP CE Mark trial for our PASCAL mitral repair therapy remains on track, and we still expect to launch this platform in 2019. And we continue to treat patients in our U.S. early feasibility study.","In mitral valve replacement, we're continuing to see good clinical progress with both of our transseptal programs, Edwards' CardiAQ and SAPIEN M3, and we're encouraged by the positive scientific presentations at TVT last month.","In transcatheter tricuspid repair, we're pleased to announce the receipt of a CE Mark for our Cardioband Tricuspid Valve Reconstruction System, and clinicians have begun treating patients. In the U.S., we're on track to begin the early feasibility study but may be limited by supply.","Overall, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities to treat patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid valve disease with our transcatheter therapies, and we continue to expect the global opportunity to be more than $3 billion by 2025. We're optimistic in achieving significant clinical milestones in 2018 and realizing our goal of launching at least one new therapy a year in each of the next several years. You can expect to hear incremental clinical updates at the upcoming PCR London Valve and PCT medical meetings.","And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thank you, Mike. We continued this year's strong performance with adjusted sales in the second quarter of $972 million. At the foreign exchange rates we used to provide guidance back in April, adjusted sales would have been approximately $10 million higher. Adjusted sales grew 10% on an underlying basis.","Adjusted sales exclude a $28 million sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for surgical valves in the U.S. As a reminder, we initiated this consignment model in the first quarter to complement the introduction of our new premium products and streamline inventory management at hospitals. We expect to complete the conversion by the end of 2018 and estimate the conversion will impact sales by $60 million to $75 million this year. We are excluding these conversions in our non-GAAP sales results and underlying growth rates.","In addition to our strong sales performance, adjusted earnings per share grew 14.8% to $1.24. GAAP earnings per share was $1.32, which includes several tax benefits and the surgical valve consignment conversion I just mentioned. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release, and I will provide further details on the tax benefits in a moment.","I'll now cover the details of our second quarter results and close with an update on guidance for 2018. For the quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 74.4%, compared to 75.3% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by a 120-basis point impact from foreign exchange and continued investments in our operations, partially offset by a more profitable product mix.","We continue to expect our 2018 adjusted gross profit margin, excluding special items, to be between 74% and 76%. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $275 million or 29.1% of sales, compared to $244 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by personnel-related expenses and the strengthening of the euro against the dollar. The ratio of SG&A as a percentage of sales would have been 80 basis points lower if you exclude the impact of the consignment conversion. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 28% and 29% of sales for the full 2018 year.","Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 15% over the prior year to $154 million. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter heart valve therapy programs, including spending on clinical trials. For the full year 2018, second half spending is expected to be higher than the first half, and we continue to expect R&D, excluding special items, to be between 16% and 17% of sales.","Turning to taxes, we now expect our 2018 full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be at the low end of our previous guidance range of 13% to 16%. This quarter's rate benefited from several items. Accounting for employee stock-based compensation benefited our tax rate nearly 7 percentage points and earnings per share by $0.08, which was in line with our guidance. Additionally, our reported tax rate benefited from special items this quarter that we excluded from adjusted earnings per share. Most significantly, during the quarter, we settled tax audits that resulted in a $36 million benefit to our tax provision. Additionally, we realized a year-to-date $9 million nonrecurring benefit stemming from updated U.S. tax reform planning. This quarter, total special tax items combined to benefit GAAP earnings per share by $0.24.","Foreign exchange rates increased second quarter sales by $19 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now estimate a $30 million lift, or about 1%, to full year 2018 sales compared to the prior year. This current estimate is about $50 million lower than our estimate last year. Compared to our April guidance, foreign exchange rates impacted earnings per share by less than $0.01 this quarter, reflecting the effective currency hedging program we have in place.","Free cash flow generated during the second quarter was $87 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $140 million, less capital spending of $53 million.","Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion. Total debt was $1.2 billion. During the quarter, we extended our credit facility and refinanced bonds to strengthen our capital structure. In June, we issued $600 million of 10-year bonds in advance of the maturity of our outstanding bonds this October and entered into a related swap agreement. As a result of our revised debt position and forecasted higher interest income for the year, we now expect our net interest expense for 2018 to be approximately $5 million.","In April, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for $400 million. Average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter declined to 214 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2018 to be between 213 million and 215 million. As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $850 million remaining of our share repurchase authorization.","Turning to our 2018 guidance, given our strong performance during the first half of the year, at current exchange rates we remain confident in achieving the higher end of each of the sales guidance ranges shared at our Investor Conference in December. Those ranges are $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion for transcatheter heart valve therapy, $810 million to $850 million for Surgical Heart Valve Therapy and $610 million to $650 million for Critical Care. And for total Edwards, $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion.","For full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share, we are raising our guidance range to $4.60 to $4.75, up from our previous guidance of $4.50 to $4.70. This improvement is driven by our strong first half performance and a lower projected tax rate.","Lastly, we will continue to expect full year 2018 free cash flow to be at the higher end of our original guidance range of $700 million to $775 million. For the third quarter of 2018, at current foreign exchange rates, we project total sales to be between $900 million and $950 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 to $1.03.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thanks, Scott. We remain confident in our outlook for continued strong sales growth, and we remain passionate about helping more patients around the world. We continue to focus on driving organic growth with leading innovative technologies while aggressively investing in our future. Our foundation of leadership coupled with a robust product pipeline positions us well for continued longer term success and greater shareholder value as we pursue multi-billion dollar market opportunities.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David K. Erickson - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thank you, Mike. Before we open it up for questions, I'd encourage you to mark your calendars for Tuesday and Wednesday, December 4 and 5, when we will host our 2018 Investor Conference here at our corporate headquarters in Irvine. This event will include updates on our latest technologies as well as our outlook for 2019. Look for more information in the next few months.","We're ready to take questions now. In order to allow broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue, and we'll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the call.","Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. And thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh. Great. Thank you very much, and thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask two TAVR related questions, if okay. First is a question on the TAVR pipeline, and the second is a question on TAVR numbers in Europe this quarter. So I'll start with the pipeline, and I apologize if is missed this. But can you just update us on when will CENTERA be back in full launch outside the United States? And also please update us on what your latest expectations are for Ultra, both outside the United States and in the United States. Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. So what we indicated, Bob, was that we had completed the minor modifications to the delivery system on CENTERA and that we planned the commercial introduction and our U.S. pivotal trial late in the third quarter. So we're going to start the pivotal in the U.S. and have a commercial introduction ready to go by the end of the third quarter.","As it relates to Ultra, we're continuing to enroll patients in the small clinical trial, and we are using that to supplement our European regulatory submission. So we're on track to receive the CE Mark later this year, and in the U.S., we expect to gain U.S. regulatory approval late in 2018.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So basically, no real changes there from what you were articulating previously.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Exactly right.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then one other question I wanted to ask is on the European TAVR growth. Last quarter, you said the market grew double digits and Edwards was slower due to competition. It sounds, maybe, like from your comments here today that the competitive pressures in Europe got a little worse in the second quarter. Is that the right read? Was that all pricing? Or was that volume? Just maybe a little more color on what's going on outside the United States this particular quarter.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. We felt like we saw some change in behavior from our competitors on pricing. We made a strategic decision. We've been operating this way for quite a while to maintain our pricing, and we're willing to cede share over the short term to competitors who have chose to price aggressively. We've observed some recent behavior, appears to be \u2013 it's kind of a more aggressive regional pricing and they don't \u2013 they're not \u2013 we kind of maintained this careful control on a global basis. So we don't see that same behavior all the time from our competitors.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. I'll leave others to follow-up a little on that. I'm sure there'll be more questions on pricing, but thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Good afternoon. Thank you. Just a follow-up on the same topic with regards to European share trend and pricing. Can you just talk a little about what you're assuming for the rest of this year to the extent that the change in competitive behavior was perhaps a bit of a surprise? Why are you confident that that dynamic doesn't get worse throughout the course of this year such that you're able to still hit the higher end of your range? And as part of that, can you talk a little about the importance of having CENTERA and Ultra available? Is that a big part of why you're confident? Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Well, thanks, Isaac. You put your finger on it. Yeah, one of the things that gives us comfort is the fact that we have SAPIEN 3 Ultra and CENTERA, two terrific valve systems, coming. We really believe that it's going to reinforce our leadership position. We're quite prepared for that Ultra launch in Europe, and we expect that to be a strong one. And then CENTERA's coming along as well. And so this is going to be a chance for us to touch many of our customers across Europe and, we think, change the dynamic in a time when, even though SAPIEN 3 is the best-in-class valve platform, it's been in place for a couple years now.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, Mike. And Scott, just a question on the EPS cadence for the rest of this year, your updated guidance does seem to call for a pretty big sequential pickup from 3Q into 4Q. Can you maybe give us a little more detail as to the key assumptions that underpin that? And to the extent that the new product launches are part of it, that'll be a helpful addition. Thank you.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. The EPS guidance increase midpoint is $0.07 or $0.08, and it reflects the beat in the second quarter, which resulted from a couple things. One was the \u2013 really the delay in recording some expenses that we expect to record now in the second half of the year. And so part of that beat in the second half is going to be contributing to EPS \u2013 or beat in the first half is going to be contributing to higher EPS in the second half and part of it is going to go to more investment in R&D and catching up on some spending.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Mike, let me ask you two big-picture questions. So the MEDCAC and the NCD, just could you give us your thoughts on the MEDCAC yesterday and if you think the reopening of the NCD will be a net positive for TAVR? And if so, why. And I had a follow-up question.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah, yeah. Thanks a lot, Larry. We saw, obviously, those mixed reactions that came out of the MEDCAC panel yesterday. There was a \u2013 we'd say, a lack of consensus. That was not surprising to us. We believe that CMS understands the key issues. They're going to take them into consideration, and they'll look at volume correlations but they'll also think deeply about quality. And they'll also think deeply about access and how that relates to the underserved. So ultimately, we believe that this is really not a change to our long-term thinking. We expect the adoption of TAVR therapy to continue to grow, and we're confident in the $5 billion plus opportunity by 2021.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. And then there's several ongoing mitral group (28:46) outcome studies, Mike, as you know that'll begin reading out in 2018, most notably MITRA.fr at ESC and COAPT which is expected to be at TCT in September. Can you talk about the potential impact to the field and your expectations? There's been obviously a lot of nervousness among clinicians, a lot of this reported in the medical press. If these studies only show quality of life benefits but no benefit to mortality and hospitalizations, for example, how will that impact the field? Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","We continue to believe that a successful COAPT will be very beneficial, but aside from that, we believe the TMTT opportunity is likely to reach more than $1 billion by 2021 regardless of the result. Negative COAPT could perhaps be an issue, but more likely people are going to point to the trial endpoint design.","So it's something that we think deeply. We work very closely with FDA when we design our own endpoints, but it's pretty rare \u2013 when have you a technology that's going to impact mortality, I think you're going to have some very successful products that have an impact on quality of life. If you were to actually get a mortality impact, I think that is probably above and beyond what people are anticipating today.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Scott, just a financial question for you, and then maybe a strategic one for Mike. Just on the three tier earnings guide, Scott, if I look at your historical cycling at the midpoint of your range, it kind of implies you do the upper end around $1.03 in the third quarter. So I'm just sort of curious, what gets to you the bottom end of the earnings range for the third quarter? Because that would put you sort of outside of your kind of historical cycling.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","That's probably, David, really tied to just sequencing and phasing of when we record expenses during the third quarter. That's probably what's going to influence most our earnings per share. We will get some contributions to EPS from the CENTERA introduction and from the CAP in the U.S., but those are really fourth quarter events, not third quarter events, to your question.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Mike, just two kind of strategic thoughts, clinical questions. The first would be embolic protection. Obviously one of your competitors sort of made a move to perhaps build that market. Have your views around embolic protection changed at all? And I appreciate your comments on PASCAL, it sounds like you're on track. We heard some things about detachment issues ex-U.S. Just want to sort of ask about those issues and why you still remain very confident in the outlook for PASCAL. Thanks so much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. Yeah. On the acquisition, the system that was studied, when it was used with Edwards valves it didn't show any benefit. And so recall with the SAPIEN 3 data that you've seen in the past, there's very low stroke rates at 1% at 30 days. So our belief is that adding another delivery system, another catheter, potentially adds as much risk as it erases. So for the additional cost, it's not worth it. So, we don't think it's going to be an important part of the therapy. As it relates to PASCAL \u2013 does that answer that question, David?","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Yes, sir.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Okay. So as it relates to PASCAL, we're pleased with the way that's going. Enrollment is on track, and we look forward to having the results presented at future medical meetings. We plan to complete the PASCAL CE Mark trial in 2018 and expect to launch the product in 2019.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Hi. This is Anthony in for Raj. Maybe just to go back to NCD, MEDCAC. Just \u2013 when you compare the public comments, they seem to be more notably positive than sort of the comments out of MEDCAC . I'm just wondering, how do you weight those two as you go into the final decision? And should we get a situation where the volume requirements are actually eased, do you see a situation where perhaps that possibly could bend the growth curve upward? And then a quick follow-up would just be on Cardioband into second half. I think the guide is still for $15 million full year. Just how should we think about the ramp into Q3, Q4? Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So, yeah, I mean if you watched that MEDCAC panel, there were a lot of different voices that came through. Our belief is that CMS understands those key issues pretty well and are going to take them into consideration the full range. It's not the MEDCAC panel that ultimately matters, its how that new NCD gets written. And that's probably going to happen sometime over the next year. We believe that the qualification shouldn't be based solely on volume requirements and our priority is to ensure equitable access. It's probably too early for us to comment on how it's going to go. The \u2013 I think all of their comments in total, whether it's the panel themselves or the public comments that have been coming in and continue to come in are all going to be considered by CMS.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","And on the Cardioband second half impact, I think you should expect that we're going to be ramping between now and year-end and so you should expect more sales in Q4 than in Q3.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","That's helpful. Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","So as we previously indicated, we're in the process of integrating the Cardioband supply chain into the Edwards quality system and the inventory might be constrained throughout 2018 as we continue that process. So we're still in position where we expect to ramp TMTT sales in the second half to reach approximately $15 million for the full year.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, Mike. Thanks for taking my question. Two TAVR related questions for you. More sort of 20,000-foot view, one of them. And then one specific to your business. So you exit the first half I believe somewhere around 11% underlying growth in that business and you've reiterated the expectation you'll be at the top end. So you're obviously looking to accelerate that in the second half.","And then I know you're not ready to give 2019 guidance but it certainly looks like the set-up is with low risk data coming in the first half of the year, CENTERA and Ultra launches as you've mentioned and then the approval for low risk in the second half of the next year, are we possibly about to embark on a calendarized next four or five quarters where the growth profile for your TAVR business, perhaps TAVR for everyone in the market, accelerates a little bit?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Let me see if I can answer. First, I believe that the first half sales was more in the 12%, 12.5% range and not 11% so it's not maybe quite as big a leap. But we do continue to expect to be at the higher end of 11% to 15%. What we've got going for us is the fact that we've got Ultra and CENTERA coming later in the year. The TMTT, the Cardioband, gets reported in that category. And we also have CAP which will be a contributor. Remember, that's a nonrandomized trial. So, all those help contribute to the growth rate in the fourth quarter if you will.","Looking forward, we're not ready to share any growth rates for next year. As you know, we feel like the CAGR is going to average in the mid-teens to reach this $5 billion plus opportunity by 2021 for the broad market and we expect and we're confident that we're going to prove non-inferiority with the positive clinical trial output.","We're not really \u2013 expecting superiority, Jason, if that's a bit of where you're going. So at this point, I think you're going to have to wait for the investor conference to get a projection for 2019, but we continue to feel that strategically, we're very well positioned. We have a rich pipeline and we're aggressive investors in this space and we continue to know that there's a large untreated group of patients that we can reach in the future.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful, Mike. And just following up on that. Your comment about the non-inferiority versus superiority. Do you think that there is a different market reaction if you do indeed get \u2013 show data that's either superior or trending towards that? And if you don't get it as you'd expected, do you still expect that the low risk data will have a positive impact on the market? And then lastly on that front, similarly, with respect to your market estimates, at even 10% growth the market would CAGR over the next two years, you're going to get to that $5 billion mark probably a year earlier than 2021. So I just wanted to make sure that I heard you right, that when you say by 2021 that...","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","You're not expecting slowing growth. Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","So I mean, on your first point, Jason, we think the market's pretty smart. They know that this trial is powered for non-inferiority, that it would take a much, much larger trial to drive superiority. So I don't think anybody is really seriously expecting superiority. So when we prove non-inferiority, we think that's a net positive because it's going to impact an FDA approval, which will be supported then by reimbursement, and it will give clinicians the opportunity to expand their treatment.","Separate from that though, I think you were talking about how we think that \u2013 we're continuing to see that this technology has a lot of legs. Length of stay is improving, quality of life. It's a preferred procedure by patients. And so when we said plus $5 billion by 2021, we realize that there's upside. So, of course, there's an upside in that number, that marker out there but I think I think when we made that prediction, it was out there four or five years, which always is a little bit dangerous. But we continue to feel confident in what we said.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please proceed.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe, Mike, now I want to start off on the last question on the back half guidance, right, the acceleration implied by the guidance. If you look at the Cardioband guidance, so that's going to contribute somewhere north of 100 bps of growth in the back half, right? So TAVR which has done about 12%, 12.5% in the first half, that's going to accelerate north of 13.5% in the back half, which still implies TAVR is going to improve by about another 100 bps, right, to get us close to that 15% in the back half or north of 15%. Now, I'm just curious because it seems like a lot of this optimism is being baked around Ultra and CENTERA launch in Europe and given that these are premium price product and the commentary we've heard on competition being \u2013 pricing aggressively in select regions for it, I'm just trying to match why CENTERA and Ultra, if they're going to be premium priced, why are they going to accelerate growth in the back half?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. So a couple of things. One is, we're not shaken by what happens in any given quarter on market share that it's some kind of fundamental change to the heart valve market. These are heart valves. People buy heart valves based on quality, based on proven outcomes with scientific studies, and we think that they'll continue to do that. When we have products like CENTERA and Ultra that are going to be introduced, those are some pretty terrific products, and we think they're really going to get people's attention and they're going to be interested in those. And those are going to give us some lift. But as you properly no doubt note, TMTT, what happens in Cardioband is also going to give us a lift and that CAP study that's going to coming shortly will also give us a lift. So that combination gives us a lot of confidence that we're going to be at the high end of the 11% to 15% range.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","That's helpful, Mike. I forgot about the CAP study. Maybe on that last comment on TMTT, that's implied fourth quarter Cardioband number, right? Is that a normalized run-rate number, Mike? Because is there some catch-up of this demand, right? Because right now we're supply constrained. Does that 4Q, if that's a north of a $12 million \u2013 let's call it high singles or $10 million number \u2013 should we annualize that for next year? Or is there \u2013 what's the normalized quarterly run-rate for that Cardioband number?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah, Vijay, in the field this soon I think it's a little early for us to be projecting how we end the year and how to plan 2019 and beyond. We do think there's a lot of demand there and that we'll be able to hit the numbers that we projected during the fourth quarter. But I'll ask that you have some patience and wait till the Investor Conference, and we'll try and lay out what our longer-term plans are at that time.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thank you, guys.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please proceed.","Christopher Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Mike, Abbott announced the start of their Tendyne U.S. trial earlier today. You mentioned you're making good progress with your own mitral replacement programs. Can you give us any more color on when you think you could be in a position to ramp up clinical activity there with one or both of those products? And is it still your plan to wait until you have a transseptal system fully ready to go before you start your own U.S. trial?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yes. Yeah, I think we reported on the call here that we continue to see good clinical progress with both of those platforms, and our strategy is unchanged. We are very focused on transseptal. We think that the transseptal solution is going to be necessary to drive the safety and the efficacy and the chance to really drive that opportunity. And so we're not deterred by the fact that there might be a transapical system that comes sooner. We just don't think that's going to be really meaningful in the long-term.","Christopher Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. And then I wanted to ask a rare Critical Care question here. That business has been a real standout performer in the first half of the year, and at this point you're running at about 10% underlying growth. You guided to 8%. Can you talk about the drivers there? And is there any reason we should necessarily expect that momentum to fall off and come down to that lower level?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Our Critical Care team is not used to having the spotlight here, but I'm sure they welcome it. We did see really strong growth, and one of the things that underpins it is the HemoSphere. But the other thing that I'll note is that we had some help in the U.S. by new GPO contracts. So we're not ready to say that you should count on this same growth rate throughout the year, but nonetheless, we're expecting this to be a strong year for Critical Care and to be at the high end of the 6% to 8% growth rate.","Christopher Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Can we revert back for a moment into Europe? Trying to better understand the dynamics there. How much of it is companies who have had products in the market for a long time compressing their pricing? And how much of it may be is some newer products or companies just coming on in now with lower prices?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. You know, it's actually a little bit of both. So we still have the longer term competitor that does some aggressive pricing, but we also see that the Symetis product that's now in the hands of a larger company, going to places that they haven't been before and also sort of continuing some of the aggressive pricing of the past.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And as a follow-up, just to sort of set the stage for next year because I think most investors assume you get low risk approval in 2019, what kind of ramp do you think we should expect? And similar to the intermediate risk level approval, do you think that you'll start to see some flow-through after the data presentation and before approval by the FDA?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. It's a good question, Joanne. We're going to spend some time really trying to lay that out in detail. Our history is that, yeah, the data itself does drive some level of performance, but the actual approval by FDA does also bring reimbursement along with it. So those both are factors.","In our experience, it kind of smoothes over time. It's not a step function, and we would expect that to be the case in 2019. But probably not prepared at this point to be able to get much deeper than that.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Mike, two questions on the U.S. market. So it sounds like the U.S. market was in line with your \u2013 the market and your sales were in line with your expectations, but in past quarters when the U.S. would come in better, Mike, you always called out new centers. And you always called out volumes coming in stronger at the new centers. So I'm wondering, can you give us some color as to how many centers you started up in the second quarter? And are you still getting the strong demand from these new centers? And then I had a follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. Yeah. We did get new centers. I don't know the number, but I think we're closing in to around 600 centers at this time in the U.S. And what my commentary was intended to do was not to say that we didn't get a lift from new centers, because we did, but we saw it very broad-based. We also saw a lift in the centers that had been around for \u2013 very large centers that have been around for a while. So it was particularly broad-based this quarter.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then just as a follow-up, the NCD that's going to be considered over the next 12 months. Do you think that has any impact near-term on more centers opening up? Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Well, I mean, I don't think in the near term there's going to be any change. When we actually see what's written in the NCD, it could have some impact. Now, what do we think is going to happen? It's a little difficult for us to predict the future, but if you were to ask us strategically if we changed our outlook, no. We haven't changed our outlook. We think the NCD is going to provide a favorable climate, and so that TAVR technology will continue to expand.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please proceed.","Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, Mike. How you doing? I know \u2013 turning to mitral, you've touched on it in various ways. It's hard to predict and you're not yet in the clinic with M3 or CardiAQ but just as I reflect on the next couple of years it would seem like there's going to be a couple of mitral replacement devices hanging in the clinic with very large trials. Do you worry at all? Should we be concerned at all that it's going to be difficult to enroll or something more challenging than usual? How are you thinking about that?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Well, this is one of the reasons why we're, frankly, attracted to TF as an option. We would imagine it might be difficult to enroll a TA trial. We know what the rate of surgery is today for mitral patients and its not attractive. And although TA might be incrementally better than open chest surgery, we don't think it's a big enough leap to really change treatment patterns and that's why we're convinced the transseptal offering is the right approach to take on a longer-term basis.","Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got you. And to follow up on Ultra, just wanted to make sure I understand your viewpoint. Is Ultra market share driving, price sustaining? Is it procedure expanding? Just help me understand how it might stem \u2013 or offset the EU tide of share loss that we've seen there if at all. Is that the right way to think about it? Maybe reframe the way I'm saying it.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah, we hadn't initially pegged it as a share gainer. We look at it as one that has greatly enhanced features and help us maintain our leadership. But having said that, it's an opportunity for us to go out there and spend time with each center. It's a chance for us to go through the training process and we think they're going to like what they see.","Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And just a last quick one on Japan. You said it was strong. Is it running as expected? Are you \u2013 now you that \u2013 every quarter that passes, do you have a greater sense of that market that there might be some upside there? Again, any color would be welcome. Thanks so much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah, we've always found Japan to be an incredible opportunity. We think the opportunity is still very significant. It's tracking just about what we expected but it's a lot to say. As fast as TAVR is growing, it is our fastest growing region again this quarter. We continue to see strong TAVR adoptions and several new centers were being added there. So, that's an encouraging sign.","Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, I unfortunately watched that MEDCAC yesterday and I was struck by the almost total lack of interest in the data that both you and Medtronic put forward regarding center variability and the fact that even if there's a little bit, it pales in comparison to non-treatment, which is your point. But my question is, you guys have a lot of experience with SAVR. There was no real discussion about what the volume to outcome relationship is for SAVR, which is a much more invasive procedure with probably greater chance for poor outcomes if things aren't done exactly properly. Could you comment on that and how that might fit into the ultimate decision CMS makes?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yes. Yeah, I wish you were on the panel yesterday because your observation is a good one. I think there are going to be a number of considerations that go into reconsidering the NCD. The panel was asked to focus on nine specific questions and that wasn't one of the questions that they were really asked to delve into. I think we think it's a fascinating one and it's a really important one.","We continue to believe that both TAVR and surgical valve replacement procedures should be expanded but they should be restricted to programs that deliver high quality outcomes. So, we are of that mind, and we think that CMS is going to take a broad perspective when they reconsider the NCD.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And a very brief follow-up. Just on the \u2013 when you mentioned 10% ex-U.S. underlying growth in TAVR, was that not counting the slight ASP uplift you're referring to procedures? I just want to be very clear about that.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","So the slight uplift in ASP \u2013 what we were talking about was on a global basis. And so on the global basis, you saw regions like Japan and U.S., which have stronger ASPs grow faster, and so that's what I was trying to indicate by the ASP, right?","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. So your TAVR revenue growth ex-U.S. was around 10%?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Correct. Yes.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you so much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping, Mike, to just get your view or just experience here over the last half of the year on surgeons' behavior, particularly whether or not they're defending their territory, or any last gasp efforts in front of low risk data next year. I mean, the MEDCAC meeting occurred. You had the consensus expert document that was run by surgical societies primarily, but just wanted to kind of hear what you're experiencing out there on the surgeons' side in terms of whether they're defending their turf more aggressively at some of these centers.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. I think we have a lot of common views with those that were involved with the consensus documents, but there's other places where we depart. And we can accuse the other side just as they accuse us of being self-interested, so I set that aside. I like to think that the evidence is going to prevail and that there's going to be good sense.","You have this remarkable procedure in TAVR that really addresses a very serious and debilitating disease with a procedure that's safe and very effective and can be performed around the world, actually, at a high level of proficiency, and we don't think that's going to be lost.","So ultimately I think it's going to come through. The practice of medicine always changes frustratingly slow, and so we're not totally surprised by that. But ultimately we think the technology will stand on its own merits.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for that. And I just wanted to follow up just with you calling out the CAP program as a modest tailwind in the second half year. Can we just \u2013 help us think through the clinical revenue headwinds that you guys were facing in the first half? I mean, low risk trial was enrolling at full pace is my understanding in the first half of last year, and the early TAVR and TAVR UNLOAD I believe are kind of slower enrolling trials. But any type of color in terms of the clinical revenue headwind you faced in the first half that's now going to be resolved by the CAP program coming on, it would be great. Thanks again.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. I don't know. I mean, it's possibly helpful to think about it this way. Our low risk finished up at the end of last year, but remember the low risk trial was a randomized trial, so half of the patients would have gotten SAPIEN 3, half of them no therapy.","When you implement a CAP program, it's not a randomized trial. So you can almost think of it as at twice the pace as you would have had in terms of clinical, because you don't have the half that would have gotten surgery.","Hello? Are you there?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Please proceed.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up \u2013 and I'm sorry. It keeps coming up on the call, but just as we look at the back half and the market share loss that you guys talked about in Europe, and I appreciate that Ultra's definitely an improvement, CENTERA as well. You'll be re-launching or restarting the launch of CENTERA. But how do you think about the receptivity of some of the European accounts to price uplift? I am hearing that Medtronic is getting a premium relative to their Evolut R for Evolut PRO, but I'm also hearing Portico is pricing it at a 50% discount. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how aggressive some of these other players are and what that's doing to the mindset of some of these centers as it relates to paying even more relative to SAPIEN 3.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. We think that heart valves are very important. We have a very long term history with surgical heart valves, and we choose not to really approach that as a market that should be buying on price. I mean, this is something that's expected to keep you alive for years, and we think that \u2013 we try and offer a lot of value. We back up our best technology and continue to try and push it and back it up with a lot of evidence.","And so we just \u2013 we don't compromise on pricing. It's not surprising to have competitors at a lower price, and so this is not unexpected. And it's always going to be a little bit lumpy. But on a long-term basis, we expect that the best technology is going to prevail and maintain a strong leadership position.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","And so, I guess, are you in essence sort of saying you highlighted some share loss the last two quarters ex-U.S.? These new products, even though you are expecting to price them at a premium, you think they help you regain share? Or do you think it just improves the mix for Edwards?","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Yeah. I think we're very proud to be the leader, and we expect to be able to maintain that leadership. It probably does help from a share perspective, Danielle.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And thanks for taking the question. Scott, I wanted to ask you a financial question here. With the tax guidance, the low end of 13% to 15% now, versus 19% to 21% at the Analyst Day before tax reform, can you help us understand how much of the EPS revision this year has come from financial leverage, like lower tax, debt pay-down, share buyback and how much of it has been from operational gains?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. So tax legislation probably contributed about 5%, 5 percentage points to the reduction in our effective tax rate. Before we got some benefit from some refined interpretation about the tax legislation. So it's probably a bit more than 5 percentage points. And then we got some benefit as well that was in excess of what we expected for the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. So those two together reduced the rate pretty significantly from the original guidance at the Investor Conference.","Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And how much of this tax rate is sustainable? How do we think about what it should be on an ongoing basis in 2019 and beyond?","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. So this year, think low end of that 13% to 16% range. Longer term, we're still processing how we're going to true-up and realize the benefits of the tax legislation, and so we'll give you more guidance at the Investor Conference. But I think directionally the guidance we would provide would probably be mid-teens at this point, and we'll give you some more definition around that as we get to the Investor Conference.","Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And maybe just one quick follow-up. Capital allocation, you did the ASR earlier this year, but cash continues to build. How should we think about future uses of that cash? Do you look to build out or supplement the mitral \u2013 transcatheter mitral and tricuspid pipeline? Or is share repurchase going to be the focus? Thanks.","Scott B. Ullem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Sure. So, our capital allocation priorities haven't really changed. The first call on cash is continuing to invest in our internal growth programs and programs especially that would generate higher returns over the long-term. Second is supplementing those internal programs with external investments, whether it's minority investments or acquisitions of companies on the smaller size. And then we get to financial engineering and using our balance sheet, like share repurchase, which we'll continue to do over time. As a reminder, we've got $850 million of share repurchase authorization left.","Michael A. Mussallem - Edwards Lifesciences Corp.","Okay. Well, thanks, all.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Erickson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Erickson, you may begin.","David Erickson","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our second quarter 2013 financial results.","During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and the accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Abate, CFO.","Before I turn the call over to Mike, I'd like to remind you that during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, our expectations regarding sales and sales growth, gross profit margin, earnings per share, SG&A, R&D, taxes, free cash flow, diluted shares outstanding and foreign currency impacts. These statements also include our current expectations for the timing, status and expected outcomes of our clinical milestones and trials, regulatory approvals, regulatory compliance and reimbursement, as well as expectations regarding market opportunities, the U.S. launch of SAPIEN, new product introductions, competitive conditions, and the impact of patent litigation. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Although, we believe them to be reasonable, these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or experiences to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","Information concerning factors that could cause these differences may be found in our press release, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and our other SEC filings, which are available on our website at edwards.com.","Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying, excluding the impact of foreign exchange constant currency, and excluding special items, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem","Thank you, David. We're pleased to report solid second quarter results, driven by strong sales of transcatheter and surgical heart valves in both the U.S. and Europe. Our SAPIEN in the U.S. continues to be highlighted by the very high procedural success rates and we are gratified to see this therapy changing the lives of so many patients. The growing body of positive clinical data reinforces our conviction that transcatheter valve technology offers a compelling treatment option for a large and growing patient population.","During the quarter, we received the approval of SAPIEN XT in Japan, setting the stage for our launch there next year. And more recently, a German court found the competitor infringes our intellectual property and issues an injunction order against them.","Now turning to our quarterly results. Reported sales grew 7% to $517 million. Sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange was 10%. Strong transcatheter and surgical heart valves helped drive 16% sales growth in the United States. THV and surgical valves were also strong contributors to growth in Europe.","In transcatheter heart valve, second quarter sales of $182 million were driven by the ongoing U.S. SAPIEN launch and improved growth in Europe.","In the U.S., THV sales were $90 million for the quarter, which included clinical sales of $10 million. Reorder sales this quarter more than doubled from a year ago. Clinical sales were a bit higher sequentially, lifted by enrollment on our expanded nested registries. We anticipate registry enrollment to continue in the third quarter, which will facilitate efforts to expand SAPIEN XT's indication to include these important patient subgroups. This quarter's results also included $1 million of net stocking sales.","As we previously indicated, as more sites move through the consignment conversion process, the impact of consignment should exceed stocking sales in the second half of 2013.","We continue to expect reported sales in 2014 to more closely track procedures performed.","At June 30, approximately 250 sites in the U.S. offered SAPIEN to their patients. Almost 220 sites met our qualifications and were trained to begin transapical delivery.","Importantly, as the number of sites has increased and the TA approach has become more broadly adopted, clinicians have continued to maintain very high procedural success rates.","Overall, we continue to believe that TAVR economics and hospital capacities are not yet optimized at most sites, and there remains significant opportunity for improvement. Our U.S. team is now focused on educating sites on appropriate TAVR reimbursement and improving lengths of stay. The nearly 12,000 patients in the U.S., whose lives have been transformed by SAPIEN in the past 2 years, are a constant reminder of the impact and benefits of this therapy.","Outside the U.S., THV sales grew 9% in the quarter or 10%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Unit sales grew approximately 11%, and pricing declined slightly.","Sales in Southern Europe grew for the first time in over a year. Transfemoral units grew approximately 20% and represented approximately 70% of sales consistent with last quarter. We estimate new companies entering the TAVR space sold less than 10% of commercial units in the quarter, mostly concentrated in Germany. We expect this rate to increase with anticipated fourth quarter competitive approvals.","At the recent EuroPCR and TBT meetings, our SAPIEN platform was featured prominently in numerous live cases and data presentations. A particular note was 1 year data from SOURCE XT registry that studied our lower profile SAPIEN XT valve. These data, which showed a 1-year survival estimate of 85% for TF patients and low incidence of procedural complications in stroke, confirming the positive real-world TAVR, provides patients a quality of life and heart function that's improved.","At both meetings, clinician interest in our newest technologies was very strong. And while there are new competitive offerings in development, we remain confident that the strength and breadth of our pipeline will enable us to solidify our leadership position.","Now updating our clinical and product development milestones. As we indicated in our last quarterly call, we submitted our PMA for Cohort B of PARTNER II in late April. While we are working with the FDA to expedite approval, we still project a mid-2014 approval, followed by a rapid introduction.","We are nearing completion of enrollment of Cohort A, the surgical arm of PARTNER II, designed to expand the indication into more moderate patients. Enrollment in other valve trials, including our own nested registries, has impacted the pace of enrollment in Cohort A, and we now expect to finish in October.","In Europe, we remain on track to receive a CE Mark and to launch our advanced SAPIEN 3 valve by the end of the year. We believe that SAPIEN 3, which is delivered through a 14-french eSheath and designed to reduce paravalvular leak, will quickly become the best-in-class transcatheter valve in Europe. We are also continuing to enroll our self-expanding CENTERA valve trial.","During the quarter, as expected, we received regulatory approval for SAPIEN XT in Japan, which makes us the first commercially available transcatheter valve in that country. We continue to expect reimbursement to be established by year-end, and we believe the transcatheter technology will be particularly attractive to Japanese patients and its introduction should represent meaningful sales growth beginning next year.","Our lead micro-transcatheter program is a valve replacement, and we continue to believe a first in human experience is likely in 2013. Treating micro-disease with transcatheter technology is a very large opportunity, and as one of the pioneers of microvalve therapies, we believe Edwards is well-positioned to be successful in this area. We're continuing to invest broadly in structural heart disease solutions and have dedicated teams working on additional approaches.","Since last quarter, there have been 2 developments in our IP litigation in Germany against Medtronic. In the first case, which asserted infringement of one of our Crebier patents, the German court found that Medtronic did not infringe and we are appealing that decision. A hearing in Germany pertaining to the infringement of a second Crebier patent is scheduled for December. Earlier this month, the German court found that Medtronic infringes our Spenser patent, which describes multiple TAVR designs, including a goblet-shaped device sized to minimize extension of the device into the left ventricle. The court granted an injunction prohibiting the sales of CoreValve and Evolut in that country, as well as the recall of these products, and accounting for past damages. We are in the process of posting a bond, which is required before we can enforce the injunction in Germany. The validity of the Spenser patent is being contested in Europe in a separate action. The patent, which expires in 2022, is also in place in numerous other European countries, including France, Italy and Spain.","Spenser patents have also been issued in the United States. The first was filed in 2001 and they expire in 2021. Our sales in Germany for the first half of 2013 were approximately $25 million, and we estimate -- I'm sorry, were approximately $65 million, our sales in the first half of 2013 were approximately $65 million and we estimate total TAVR sales for all companies in Germany to be between $200 million and $240 million this year. We're still developing plans to implement the German injunction. As this process unfolds, most importantly, we will be proactively working to ensure that all patients have access to the necessary therapy. In the event that Edwards products is not suitable, we will encourage use of alternative product.","In our U.S. case involving the Andersen patent, after the appellate court affirmed the judgment of willful infringement late last year, the Delaware trial court was instructed to reconsider Edwards' motion for permanent injunction. We have also asked for damages since early 2010. We are waiting the decision of the judge and no timing has yet been established. In parallel, Medtronic has filed a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, which we have opposed. This fall, we expect a decision as to whether it will hear the case.","In summary, we are reiterating our guidance for 2013 transcatheter heart valve sales, which excludes any favorable impact from the German injunction. We continue to expect global sales to grow 25% to 30% on an underlying basis. This would result in sales of $670 million to $750 million, which includes $350 million to $400 million of sales in the U.S. As a reminder, there was a pronounced seasonality in the third quarter of last year.","Now turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy group. Reported sales increased 2% over last year to $204 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales grew 5% compared to last year. This quarter's growth rate reflected strong global performance, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Our global ASP declined slightly, primarily due to geographic mix.","Valve pricing was stable in the U.S., and was lifted in Europe due to the growing contribution to sales of our INTUITY valve.","In the U.S., sales grew 4.4%. We believe there was an uptick in the heart valve procedures performed in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, and we also believe we gained share.","The recall of minimally invasive cannula produced in the Draper facility detracted from the surgical valve product line's growth rate. In the quarter, new long-term PERIMOUNT data was presented at meetings demonstrating unprecedented durability results for tissue valves. For aortic valves, the data demonstrated an expected durability of 17 years in patients aged 60 or younger, which represents the longest follow-up series in younger patients. For microvalves, the average patient age was 68 and the data demonstrated expect a durability of more than 16 years, which represents the longest follow-up series for a micro tissue valve.","During the quarter, INTUITY sales in Europe added approximately 1% to our overall growth rate, and we continue to make progress on our key milestones with this innovative valve system. We continue to expect to CE Mark in the near future for INTUITY Elite, our next generation platform with a lower profile designed to further enable small incisions.","In the U.S., enrollment of our TRANSFORM IDE trial remains on track and we are in the process of upgrading all sites to INTUITY Elite.","Also, in the U.S., we are continuing to enroll patients in our COMMENCE IDE trial. This trial, which includes both our market-leading aortic and micro valves, is studying the GL-X tissue on our Magna Ease platform.","As we disclosed in May, we received a warning letter from the FDA, whose observations focused on our Cardiac Surgery Systems manufacturings operations in Draper, Utah. We've made this matter a top priority and are focused on resolving it as quickly as possible. We have promptly responded to each of the specific issues addressed in the letter and are implementing the necessary actions. We do not expect this matter to have a material impact on our 2013 financial guidance.","We continue to expect underlying sales growth in Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group to be between 2% and 5% in 2013 aided by the commercialization of INTUITY.","Turning to the Critical Care product group. Total sales of $131 million for the quarter declined 4% over last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales increased 2%, driven by strong growth of advanced monitoring products tempered again this quarter by a reduction of distributor inventories in China and the ongoing exit of our ACCESS product line. The integration of our noninvasive monitoring technology is on track to be Incorporated into our EV1000 platform next year.","Sales this quarter were encouraging, but will remain moderate until 2014 when we plan to introduce the integrated platform. We remain enthusiastic about the significant opportunity represented by our GlucoClear system and are encouraged by the progress on our 2013 goals. We continue to expect 2013 to be pivotal as we complete enrollment in our ICU accuracy study in Europe by the end of the year, and gain further insight on the pathway toward U.S. approval. We continue to expect full year 2013 underlying sales growth of 2% to 4% in the Critical Care product group, driven by continued growth in our advanced monitoring products and as distributor inventories in China reach target levels.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to provide a brief update on our search for his replacement. As you know, Tom recently announced his decision to retire from Edwards later this year. Since the announcement, we've received interest from a number of highly-qualified candidates, which are -- and we are presently conducting interviews. We're making good progress and expect to identify his successor in the next several months.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Abate","Thank you, Mike. I'd like to add to what Mike shared by saying it's truly been a pleasure to work with the team here at Edwards for many years. While I'm looking forward to retirement, I will remain with the company until my successor is on board and I'm committed to a smooth transition.","Turning to the financials. This quarter, our solid sales results, combined with strong leverage, allowed us to achieve diluted EPS of $0.82. Excluding special items from the prior year, our diluted EPS grew 22%. During the quarter, we approved a new $750 million share repurchase program, and we substantially completed our existing repurchase authorization of $500 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares and now project fully diluted shares outstanding in the second half of 2013 to be approximately $114 million.","For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 75.8% compared to 73.1% in the same period last year. Last year's rate was 74.8%, excluding the impact of special charge. The improvement was driven by more profitable product mix and a favorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies. Excluding special items for the second half of 2013, our gross profit margin should be between 74% and 75%, driven primarily by a reduced benefit from FX and near-term inefficiencies as we prepare for multiple THV product introductions in 2014.","Second quarter SG&A expenses were $189 million, or 36.6% of sales, an increase of 4% over the prior year. This increase was driven primarily by the U.S. Medical Device Tax and U.S. transcatheter valve expenses, partially offset by FX and lower incentive compensation expenses. As a percentage of sales, SG&A should trend up in the third quarter due to seasonality and then decrease in the fourth quarter.","For the full year, we expect SG&A to be between 36% and 37% of sales.","We continue to aggressively invest in R&D and spending in the quarter grew 9% to $81 million, or 15.6% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of additional investments in a number of heart valve clinical studies and new transcatheter valve development efforts. We expect R&D to increase in the third quarter as we continue our investments in clinical studies. For the full year, we expect R&D to be approximately 16% of sales.","Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 22.7%, down from 24.6% in the prior year, due primarily to the absence of the federal R&D tax credit last year, and a favorable reserve adjustment this year. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be at the low end of our 23% to 24% range. FX negatively impacted second quarter sales by $14 million compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the yen.","Compared to our recent guidance, FX rates negatively impacted EPS by $0.01. Looking forward, we now expect a $55 million negative impact to full year sales.","Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $99 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $127 million, less capital spending of $28 million.","For 2013, excluding special items, we continue to expect free cash flow to be between $270 million and $310 million.","Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $575 million. Total debt was $227 million. Our DSO at the end of the quarter was 58 days, a 2-day increase from the prior quarter. Inventory turns were 1.7, consistent with the prior quarter.","Turning to our sales and earnings guidance. Since we are still estimating the potential impact of the injunction in Germany, we are not including it in our 2013 guidance at this time. Given multiple variables, we assume that the injunction isn't likely to have much impact on our third quarter results. We plan to provide an estimate in the injunction's future impact when we release our third quarter results in October.","We are maintaining our sales guidance, even though the dollar has recently strengthened moderately. At current exchange rates for the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy Product group, we continue to expect sales of $770 million to $810 million. In transcatheter heart valves, we continue to expect sales of $670 million to $750 million. And the Critical Care product group, we continue to expect sales of $530 million to $570 million. We continue to expect full year sales of $2 billion to $2.1 billion, and earnings per diluted share, excluding special items, of $3 to $3.10 resulting in a growth rate of approximately 14%.","For the third quarter of 2013, which is typically our seasonally lowest quarter, we project total sales of $475 million to $505 million, and third quarter diluted EPS, excluding special items, to be between $0.63 and $0.67.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks, Tom. Our second quarter results have increased our confidence in achieving our sales and earnings guidance and we remain enthusiastic about 2014 as we prepare for important transcatheter product launches next year in the U.S., Europe and Japan. We plan to continue investing substantially in the development of novel heart valves and other structural heart disease therapies, as well as in Critical Care technologies. We believe that our steadfast commitment to innovation will enable us to broaden our leadership position and create value for patients, clinicians and our shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David Erickson","Thank you, Mike. Before we open up for questions, I would encourage you to mark your calendars for Monday, December 9, when we will be hosting our 2013 Investor Conference in New York. This event will include updates on our new technologies, as well as our outlook for 2014. More information will be available in the next couple of months.","[Operator Instructions].","Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to go back to the U.S. transcatheter business and try to better understand the commercial stocking clinical breakout. Can you maybe just help us understand what's going on with net stocking with the $1 million number you reported this quarter, was that a reflection of fewer centers trained than expected? Or faster conversion to consignment? Can you maybe just help us think about how that progresses through the balance of the year?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, we trained approximately 25 centers in the quarter, which is very consistent with our expectation. As I think we indicated right along here, consignment is on the rise. And so what you're seeing is that, that's starting to equalize, where stocking and consignment are nearly the same.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And do you still see that net-net stocking number, did that turn negative in Q3 going forward? And any change in your thinking on how the balance of the year looks?","Michael A. Mussallem","No. I think the balance of the year is going to looking much like we signaled right along. So we expect that the consignment should exceed stocking sales in the second half of the year, and that that's going to sort of -- that will end in 2014, where in '14, the actual results will track closely with the procedures performed.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe lastly, just to understand the earnings progression here and, Tom, your comments around the gross margin. It looks like for the third quarter, based on your revenue guidance versus your earnings guidance, you're taking a pretty big margin hit. And understandably, SG&A ticks up on a ratio basis, given seasonality, but in the gross margin line, how long does that ramp up take and those manufacturing inefficiency take place? Is that something that snaps back in 2014? Or is something that might take longer to get back to that sort of 75% to 76% gross margin level?","Thomas M. Abate","David, the difference that is little bit of phasing. This quarter, Q2, was a bit stronger than I would have thought. And I think we gave a piece of that back or some of that back in the third quarter. The difference between Q2 and going forward, Q3 and Q4, is we lose some of the benefit on the year-over-year comparison due to FX. First half, I had 100, 150 of help. That pretty much dissipates in the back half. We still get benefit but not in comparison to last year. In terms of the manufacturing inefficiencies, if we can see that it'll probably affect Q3, and potentially we think of them as near term, I can't predict the exact phase out the way that would work. But remember, it's somewhat related to all of the products that are coming in the beginning of '14. So we're trying to get ready for XT launches in the U.S., you've got S3 Europe and those things. So production right now, we're balancing a lot of things at the same time. And we also had a big adjustment we took to China in the first half, which affected the volumes in Critical Care. And that's probably run through the system by the end of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So I wanted to start on Germany. Can you guys talk about when you're going to post the bond and when CoreValve will be off the market there? And when do you expect a ruling on the validity of the Spenser patent? And then I have a follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, Larry. The first thing that has to happen is the court has to issue their formal judgment. And once that formal judgment is in place, it puts us in a position to post the bond, and we're going to be in a position to do it very quickly once that's done. So we're expecting that's quite eminent. There's a whole -- there's a number of factors in terms of when the injunction might exactly go into place. I'm not sure the second part of your question?","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So a ruling on the validity of the Spenser patent, that separate ongoing litigation?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Our estimate that it could be somewhere -- anywhere in the 2- to 6-month range before we get that decision.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And I wanted to ask a question, Mike, on SAPIEN 3. Should we -- so basically, I'd be interested to hear your view on that product because the checks we're doing on that suggest a very high level of enthusiasm for the product. And given the low rate of paravalvular leaks and the 14-french delivery system. So a couple of questions on SAPIEN 3. One, should we expect any stocking effect when you -- when that's approved? Do you think you can actually take back some share with that product? And lastly, the CE Mark trial has 100 intermediate risk patients. How do you expect that data to help you? Could you actually get an indication and reimbursement for intermediate risk patients?","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure. We're very enthusiastic about SAPIEN 3. It really looks great, we're excited about it, we think it's got the potential to be the leading product very quickly. In terms of what it might do to -- I think one of your question was, what it might do to product shares, it's a little bit hard to predict. I guess, your first question was stocking. Most of the product that we have in Europe is already on a consignment basis. And so I don't expect stocking to have a significant impact as we roll that out and it's going to be difficult to predict exactly the impact that it has on competition at this point. We think that it's going to open up the indication. But right now, it's likely to have the same indication as we have today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","With respect to your guidance you reiterated in the U.S., I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color, quantifiably speaking, with respect to the polar ends of that guidance. Clearly, center's utilization are important contributors to that guidance, as are the stocking and trial revenue. Could you give us a sense specifically, on number of centers and utilization rates that you're sort of using on both ends of that guidance, to give us a little bit of a sense for probability of either one?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Well, in terms of adding centers, we're going to continue to add centers during the course of the year. I don't know if we'll have as many centers added in the second half, as we do in the first half of the year. In the third quarter, normally, the training of centers goes slightly slower. But overall, you've got the same kind of trends probably continuing throughout the course of the year, Jason. I don't expect a dramatic change from what you've seen earlier. Sites are continuing to clear their capacity, they're continuing to make some improvements on economics. And so, there's a gradual, but I don't expect sort of an abrupt change, and much change in the overall trajectory until we get to an XT introduction next year.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. So just asked a different way. Does a lower part of your U.S. guidance assume that utilization trends decelerate a bit? And the higher end assumes, perhaps, that they accelerate? Is that the way to think about it?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, that's fair. I'd say based on what we've already done, it's not clear. We could actually fall a little bit below the mid-part of the guidance for the rest of the year. For the close of the year, it's not clear. So it's hard to tell at this point, Jason, but if everything stayed the same, that's about where it would be. But we're generally expecting a mild pick up.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Last question for me. Japan. I know it's a little early to get guidance from you for 2014, but could you talk about what you're expecting preliminarily in terms of the ramp, maybe relative to what it was when you launched SAPIEN XT in Germany or Europe more broadly?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. It's going to be a little different animal than when we launched in Europe or when we launched in the U.S. So the upside in Japan is that reimbursement will be in place. The downside in Japan is that there's very few centers that have been trained at the start of launch because there were only, remember, 3 centers in our clinical trial. So it's going to be probably a more deliberate ramp as it comes up. We think there's going to be steady demand and we think the ramp is going to be a good one, but it's going to be moderate at the beginning and picking up speed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Mike, I wanted to test you a little bit on how you're seeing volumes in the U.S. to large versus small centers. If you've seen any change in that since last quarter, even? And then, have you -- as a follow-up to that, do you have any thoughts on what might be the ultimate number of U.S. SAPIEN sites? And then, I've got a follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. In terms of -- do I think things have changed? I think it's been pretty moderate change. There hasn't really been anything that's noteworthy, Brooks, to say that, gee, the large centers or the small centers have really changed in terms of their contribution to the mix. There probably tends to be more favorable economics in the larger centers. So I think they're continuing to do well. So you'd probably surmise that, that continues to be a driver. But that's probably that. In terms of total sites, we'll try and give you an update when we get to the Investor Conference. I think, last time around, we indicated that we would get to 400 centers over a 2-year period, meaning by the end of '14. Just based on the way the NCD is being interpreted, we're guessing it might be a little bit lower than that. But we're still working on that.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then, a follow-up for Tom. A follow-up for Tom just on the injunction in Germany. Maybe assuming that, that injunction comes through, call it, late Q3 or early Q4, $50 million to $60 million of potential TAVR revenue up for grabs. What's your comfort level in the street, adding some revenue to our models for that in '13 and '14? And what's kind of appropriate thinking there?","Thomas M. Abate","Well, Brooks, there's a number of variables, mostly, that relate to the start. There's questions about timing in terms of inventory in the field and how that's actually going to work through and what's actually going to happen. So we -- purposely, we gave it a lot of thought, and we decided that we probably, at this point, we'll be in a much better position to give you a good look at it when we come to next quarter's earnings. By that time, we'll have gotten through the start-up phase. We'll have a better idea of what's in place in the field and what we can do. So if you don't mind, I'd like to hold that one off to next quarter. And I think what we're trying to do though is give you a couple of key numbers for Germany to give you an idea what is available. And that is the full markets out there and our sales, and I think most of you guys can back into that pretty closely, and then it comes down to share assumptions and things like that.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then, maybe I could sneak 1 more, I apologize. Any thoughts on the injunction and, really, the whole IP portfolio as it relates to other players that are entering the market?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. We really don't discuss our litigation strategy in advance, Brooks. So we really don't have anything to add at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Imron Zafar with Jefferies.","Imron Zafar - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Sorry to beat a dead horse on Germany, but can you talk about the comment on these reports that there was bulk selling and channel stuffing from CoreValve in the second quarter and to what extent that might eat into future revenues in the third quarter?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. It's a good point. We've also heard that there's been some stocking, maybe, up to a hundreds of valves into the German market. And we're still in the process of understanding what are the implications and the options associated with that. Just to give you a little bit more color, just to get the sense for what Germany looks like, probably a good 80% of the centers -- actually, more than 80% of the centers in Germany already utilize Edwards as a product, so either exclusively or shared with CoreValve today.","Imron Zafar - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, in terms of the U.S. market, the 20 centers that put off their training in the first quarter, how many of those were actually trained in the second quarter?","Michael A. Mussallem","I believe that pretty much all of those -- there might be 1 or 2 or 3 that haven't -- but for the most part, those have all been trained. So the people that haven't been trained at this point are people that haven't already been qualified on transfemoral. We really have them go through a process where they do transfemoral first.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, I'm going to violate the rules and ask 3. First, in terms of ramp in the United States, is it finding patients or is it capacity and reimbursement? Second, given the validity hearing coming up and the disruption to clinicians, does it make sense to enforce an injunction only after you've heard the validity? And third is, could you just comment about what you believe the scale of mitral is? And might we something at TCT?","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure. First, in the U.S., economics, capacity, patients, those are all somewhat related. So it's difficult to say exactly what it is, and it's quite account-specific and even region-specific. And you might imagine, as economics improve, then more energy goes into increasing capacity and finding patients. So there really is a relation, and we have redirected our teams to really help accounts with their economics. We think they have huge opportunities for improvements, and we think that that's a linchpin. At the same time, there is some pretty steady efforts to improve capacity, but it's quite account-specific. And same thing with their ability to drive into their referral networks. They're all making some progress, but some moving faster than others. In terms of your second question, we believe that the patent is valid, and we're going to move forward with all the steps toward injunction independent of what's going to go on in terms of the judgment of validity. So we don't see that as a pivotal issue. Your final point on mitrals -- as we've pointed out, we're -- we continue to feel like it's likely that we're going to have our first in man mitral series. We're not going to talk about exactly when that is. There's a number of milestones for us still to clear before we get there, but we think it's likely. We're excited about it. It's a very large opportunity. But it's difficult to size the opportunity until you actually have the product manifestation. We do know that's a very large group of patients, and we think that a mitral replacement actually is one of those that gets after a substantial component of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe, Mike or Tom, could you help us think through the sequential flow on the U.S. TAVR commercial line? We've come at it several ways. And, Mike, I think I just heard you say it might fall, sort of, slightly below the middle end of your guidance range, not surprisingly. But can -- you had nice 2Q versus 1Q sequential increase by 12%. Given the expanded number of hospitals, can you be flat commercially or sequentially into the third quarter? Because it just seems you just need a huge step-up into the fourth quarter to get into the middle of the range, and that's where I'm sort of going. Theoretically, why should the fourth quarter be so big beyond it's not including a vacation period?","Michael A. Mussallem","Well, I mean, I'll just point out that we're in a launch and we're in a ramp, and we are adding centers. Just the first half of the year, we added 50 centers, and the other centers are becoming more mature. And as they become more mature, they're building their capacity in the process of doing that and improving their operations. So I think it's very likely to expect that there's momentum in the back half, such as the back half would be bigger than the first. As we pointed out, there has been -- there's pretty profound seasonality that we experienced last third quarter. So we're mindful of that. We really don't know what's going to happen this third quarter. And so, we hesitate to provide estimates by quarter. But you have our full year estimate, and we already have half of the year under our belt. So we have a pretty good sense of confidence that we're going to fall within the range.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe, Tom, for you. You mentioned you completed your share repurchase. I think you said you ran through the authorization. Any perspective from you or Mike on whether you're going to re-up and whether the board will consider reinitiating?","Thomas M. Abate","To be clear, what we finished was the prior authorization for $500 million. So we put about $150 million in the quarter. So we just received the new approval for a fresh $750 million. So obviously, we like the stock where it's at right now in terms of value. So the intention, as always in the past, we've used these relatively quickly in 18 to 24 months. So the thought was that, yes, we're interested in repurchasing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Swann.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Mike, I just wanted to follow up on the comment you made about hospitals not yet being optimized and you guys are working hard to help with that on reimbursement front, et cetera. What other areas can hospitals improve on? For example, is it possible for hospitals to reduce the number of resources required to do one of these procedures as they get more experience? Can you talk about that? Because it seems like, obviously, they're limited by the NCD, but the Europeans are doing something that the U.S. guys aren't doing yet. And I'm just wondering what that is as far as number of procedures per day.","Thomas M. Abate","Yes. There are a number of opportunities for improvement. Probably, the most substantial are length of stay. This length of stay are still quite large and the length of stay in the ICU is still quite long, and there are already a number of good examples of accounts -- leading accounts that are able to get their length of stays in the 4- to 5-day range. And so, being able -- for those that aren't there yet, to be able to have them see what best practices look like is great education for them, and we think that will have impact. The point you make about less resources during the procedure is also a very real one, and that has opportunity. There's also an opportunity in coding and classification. We had a chance to look back at the MEDPAR data and see real opportunities there for accounts to improve. And then, as the new technology comes out, we think that also is an opportunity. Right now, they're still dealing with the 24-French system. And as those systems get smaller, we think that it's going to mean that their economics improved, and there's real opportunities associated with that.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And is -- are you seeing progress already at centers here, or is it still too early days to tell? And what's the sort of timeline in getting these centers to a point where the structural issues aren't a factor anymore?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. It's just starting to improve. We don't think that there's very many centers that really are at optimal levels at this point. If you look back at the MEDPAR data -- and again, this is the data that was concluded in October of '12. And it looked at the prior 12 months. So really, the first 11 months of TAVR in the U.S., you even saw length of stay by quarter coming down slightly a little bit. And so, you already started from the first days of TAVR. And we think there'll be a steady progression there. And one of the things that we have an opportunity to do is to help try and share some of those best practices.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe to start, Tom. Just to clarify, on the gross margin this quarter, what was the FX contribution? You said $100 million to $150 million, but I thought you were talking about the full first half?","Thomas M. Abate","Yes -- no, I was giving -- the $150 million is probably closer to Q1 and the $100 million is closer to Q2.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. I just want to make sure I'm understanding your thought process relative to the back half of the year and maybe give you an opportunity as well [indiscernible] last year because of the seasonality and some of the reimbursement issues, the market really slowed from 2Q to 3Q, and you ended up stubbing your toe on third quarter numbers. With that in mind, do you want to just give us a little bit more thought on how we should think about particularly the TAVI performance from second quarter to the third quarter to fourth quarter? Are you expecting a similar play out in 2013, as we saw in 2012?","Michael A. Mussallem","No. It's hard to estimate. I think we've looked from time to time on what is already being estimated externally, and I'm not sure that the external estimates are necessarily that far off. But frankly, we don't know what they are, and we hesitate to actually give specific U.S. TAVI numbers by quarter.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And you are -- we are -- we should assume that the consignment headwind -- let me just make sure -- go back to your original guidance on this, but should we assume that your net stocking headwind in the second half is basically about equivalent to what the benefit was in the first half of the year?","Thomas M. Abate","Yes. We find it difficult to accurately predict net stocking. We -- as you recall, if you go back to the Investor Conference, we predicted for some time here that there was going to be this gradual change, where it was going to be. The net stocking would be a contributor to our growth early in 2013 and be -- to start detracting from growth in the back half of '13 and then pretty much wash out by '14. We think it's basically planned out that way. But we're not able to be accurate enough to call what that looks like in each individual quarter. There are too many factors there.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, last question on SAPIEN XT. The doctors seem to be anticipating approval later this year, but you guys keep talking about not until mid-2014. Can you maybe just share with us why you think it will take that long? And second, if it does come early later this year, will you need to write down SAPIEN inventory?","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure. We're real believers in XT. It's been in Europe since 2010. We think there's compelling evidence for why it should be in the U.S. And you can believe that we're making all the arguments that we know how to make with FDA to say that we should accelerate that. But just to be realistic, we made our submission of Cohort B in late April of this year. We're simply using the math to, say, add 365 days to that and there's your approval -- about that time in 2014, knowing that PMAs typically take longer than that. And we haven't necessarily been right when we've had our 1 year out there in the past. So that's what's really driving our estimates. So we're hoping that it will be better than that, but I don't think it should be something that anybody counts on.","Thomas M. Abate","Based on our experience with XT introduction in Europe, we did take a write-down of inventory because we thought the product was that much better than the SAPIEN, that it made sense. And overall, that was the right thing to do. And I wouldn't know anywhere else to go with the SAPIEN valves since the U.S. will be our last approval. So it would likely if it came earlier depending on how early, would likely result in some inventory write-off.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just following up, I guess, on SAPIEN XT. Mike, what is your, I guess, intended label indication that you're seeking for that? Are you just going according to what the Cohort B was in the inoperable patient population, or will you also seek a high-risk indication? Because I'm just curious on how that plays out with the CMS reimbursement that specifies an improved indication for an approved device, if you could potentially be in the situation with the SAPIEN XT only for inoperable and then SAPIEN for high-risk?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. That's a good question, Kristen. The trial, very clearly, was for inoperable patients. So SAPIEN -- or the PARTNER IIB trial was for inoperable, and that's the one that we're counting on. Yes, it would be nice if we would get a broader indications than that, but we really aren't anticipating that, that's going to be the case. We hope that FDA would give some consideration to have the same approval that already exists for SAPIEN. But again, that's one yet to be discussed.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, given your understanding of CMS and the reimbursement with the NCD, is it -- would that be correct in saying that the products for Medicare would then only be reimbursable SAPIEN XT in inoperable?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, that's -- our interpretation of the NCD is it's written in such a way that reimbursement occurs as there is an approved label indication. So if it was outside label, it would not be approved unless there was a protocol, in which it was being studied under.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you could have the SAPIEN for high risk and then SAPIEN XT for only in-operables until you get the expanded with SAPIEN II -- or PARTNER II data?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, yes, that's possible.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, just lastly, on the enrollment in PARTNER II, can you maybe just go back and discuss why it's taking a little bit longer? I think you mentioned some of the nested registries. Is that just simply capacity at some of the centers, I would imagine? Or -- just give me some color on that.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Yes, I'd -- we think it is. We mentioned both the nested registries and also competitive trials. And so, we believe, at some point, that that's consumed some capacity and probably slowed us down a couple of months here. In addition to the transcatheter trials that are going on, Edwards' own trials probably compete. We would imagine that some of the patients that are going into the INTUITY and GLX trials are also competing. So when you add those together with our registries in TAVI [ph] and the continued access in CoreValve, you'll end up with a fair amount of competition for these kind of patients.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mike, a question on Europe TAVI. You mentioned in the prepared comments that you have performed better than expected for that 11% unit growth. Was that all due to Southern Europe? Are there other dynamics that picked up or changed in Europe that made you make that comment?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. We were pleased with what's going on in Europe. We wonder and we watch, obviously, the overall economy in Europe, but we think the fact that the economy picking up certainly helped. But the -- we thought the single largest factor is that Southern Europe turned from being a drag on growth to being a contributor again. For example, you saw a particular pickup in Spain. So we really didn't see the pricing impact in Europe quite as much this quarter, as we've seen in the past. Outcomes continue to be strong, so it turned out to be a pretty solid quarter. And we look at it, it was pretty broad-based. We saw in the big well reimbursed countries, we mentioned already Southern Europe, we even see it in some of the extension countries of Eastern Europe. So it was pretty broad-based.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, Mike, as a follow-up on the last question. The sites in the U.S. -- the sites base is competing with trials and nested registries, how do you take that into account for the underlying commercial demand that you're expecting for TAVI in the back half of the year? How is it factored in?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. It's a good question. These are sick patients out there that really desperately need to be treated, and some of these patients are treated in clinical trials and other ones qualify for commercial. But I think that the combined number gives you a good sense for the underlying demand in the people that are making it through the system and really are expecting the procedure to be done. So it probably gives -- at least, gives us some insight as to the underlying demand out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, Mike, the Spenser patents in Europe, you kind of alluded to that these patents may also be enforced in other countries. So can you walk us through the process and the timing of Spenser being enforced in France and the U.K., as an example?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. So the Spenser patent is indeed in place, and it's got a good long life on it. And it's true in these other countries. We really -- as a matter fact, I think it's in over 20 countries. We just don't comment on future litigation. We've got a lot of decisions in front of us, Glenn, in terms of what we do. And we still haven't determined that at this point.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Would you be able to say, at least -- would Spenser and decisions in other countries, is that a 2014 event that we should expect at some point?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. I'd really not to -- want to commit any specifics at this point, Glenn.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just a real quick one. Number of selling days -- or any extra selling days in the quarter?","Thomas M. Abate","The only place we saw extra days was in Europe. Both U.S. and Japan were flat, but it was enough to maybe 1% of growth in total raw sales.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. So if you compare it to the first quarter, the first quarter actually is -- you probably heard us maybe 1% or 2% -- 2% to 3%, where we got maybe, 1% help in...","Thomas M. Abate","That's likely the way we could expect it for the remainder of the year, Glenn, is that each quarter will probably get some of what we gave up in the first quarter. So it all evens out.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So 1 or 2 points in the back end of the year?","Thomas M. Abate","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Nam with Janney.","Spencer Nam - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. The first one is -- so with Germany the competitive landscape potentially changing in the next few months. I was curious if you guys have spent any sort of pricing changes or pressure, if you will, particularly from the entrants potentially lowering the price in the market to grab some of the available share?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. In general, Spencer, we don't anticipate changing our pricing policies. Obviously, we're going to work very closely with customers to meet -- to reach mutual agreements, but we're pretty consistent in terms of the way we do that. And we do give discounts based on volume, but that's pretty much it.","Spencer Nam - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And you don't expect your competitors to be coming at you with a discounted pricing in Germany, for example?","Michael A. Mussallem","You know what? We wouldn't be surprised, in general, if competitors come in at lower pricing than we do. We find that. That's common. We don't think it's going to be dramatically lower, but we think it will be lower.","Spencer Nam - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up. In U.S., I was curious whether you guys have made a concerted effort to reach out to CoreValve sites for training? And what kind of reception\/experience you've had so far working with those centers?","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure. We have started to reach out to people. And actually, overall, the reception has been very gratifying. There aren't really -- I tried to indicate that a little earlier that over 80% of the centers already have experience with Edwards products. Oh, I'm sorry, did I misunderstand? I thought you're talking about Germany? Or you're talking about the U.S.?","Spencer Nam - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I'm talking about U.S., actually.","Michael A. Mussallem","Okay. Then I misunderstood the question. I'm sorry. Could you repeat it again, Spencer?","Spencer Nam - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Yes. So just within the U.S., while the CoreValve trial initiated, those centers were excluded from access to SAPIEN. I'm curious whether you -- over the last several months, you guys had approached these centers...","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I understand now.","Spencer Nam - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","What kind of reception you received?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. As a matter of fact, we have talked to those centers, and we probably have trained most of the CoreValve sites at this point. So those folks that are involved in implanting the CoreValve in the clinical. And I would say most of them have some experience in implanting the SAPIEN valve and are doing it today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mike, so just a question on the U.S. launch and the trajectory of the U.S. launch, looking at numbers in Q2 versus what you're able to do in Q1. And obviously, you guys kindly break out commercial versus stocking. But really, I think what most of us are looking for is trends in implants. And so, I know in commercial revenues, you had a 12% or 13% sequential uptick. But can you give us a sense in terms of what the implant rate was or the increase in implants in Q2 versus Q1?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. I think -- I guess, we feel, overall, that reorders tracks implants pretty good. There's -- when you -- I'm -- I guess I'm searching to some extent exactly how to do that. Bob, are you meaning by site or -- maybe you can...","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","[indiscernible] I would guess the cleanest way to think about your U.S. launch is how many SAPIENs did you implant -- how many were implanted in Q1 versus implanted in Q2?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. I would say take out net stocking, and the combination of clinical plus commercial is pretty close to implants. That's probably the cleanest way to look at it. Our pricing is very consistent. The pricing is slightly lower on clinical units, but you should think of something in the 30-plus-thousand dollar range for the commercial units and around $25,000 for the clinical units. And I think you can get very close to implants.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then, on mitral, I appreciate all that you've had to say here, but I'm just wondering if you could just give a little more color on -- not initially when, because you've outlined that, but exactly what will we hear -- like, how many first in man implants will there be? And is there sort of follow-up that you'll be giving? Just a little more color on exactly what we'll be hearing from you when we do ultimately hear it?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. I hesitate to be able to predict that, Bob, because a lot of this is just going to depend on how it goes. So we're going to go out there, and we're going to start implants. And if things go great, then maybe there's more. And after we've learned something that causes us to go slower, then we'll slow down. So it will depend on what we learn. We're going out with the idea that first in man is not a single implant, but a series. And that's the way we look at it, and we're just going to have to play this out one at a time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Tom, maybe just a quick question following up on Mike's comments about Germany, where 80% of CoreValve centers are -- have some cyclical [ph] nature in terms of the sales and service infrastructure. So I wondered, to the extent that revenue begins to flow potentially in the fourth quarter, how do you think about the contribution margins on that business? Do you have the reps to service those accounts? Do you have to add more reps to the extent that revenue seems to have dropped down at a high contribution margin? Do you let that drop through, or do you reinvest that money? And then, I have a quick follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem","Wow. All right. Yes. I think we're thinking of it more as a big advantage the fact that they're trained. So what we would normally anticipate is where there's going to be a lag due to training and so forth. So that doesn't seem to be the issue. So we don't need -- it doesn't seem to require extra resources there. The accounts are already covered by existing reps. So maybe -- but I don't think initially we're going to see anything. Maybe we'll tell you a little bit more, as we get into it in '14. So initially, I'd say not a big incremental spending number there that goes with that, if that's what you're asking.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Perfect. And then, Mike, just to come back to TVT for a second. Their length of stay with the fancy 3 letters of that conference. And you did mention their length of stay has come down in the last 12 months, maybe 9.5 days or 7.5 days. What's Interesting is you have certain centers seem to be breaking through a certain length of stay and still seem to be achieving a higher profitability. Do you kind of have a sense, working with centers, what you think that breakthrough number is on length of stay? And any sense of how long it could take for the U.S. to get to that number?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. In our experience, it's all about their focus. If they decide that they're really going to get focused on doing it, and they have a tight team, they have an opportunity to really drive it down. We're finding that there are more -- there are several centers that seem to be able to get into the 4- to 5-day range today. And so, we look at that and say that that's one that's been replicated in multiple accounts. And the economics certainly improve substantially when you get into that range.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And, Mike, this 4 to 5 length of stay centers, have you seen an increase in utilization at these centers once they break through, let's say, 5 days?","Michael A. Mussallem","In general, those tend to be successful TAVR sites and because they are -- the same people that are investing in driving down their length of stay, they're also investing in driving their referral networks and they tend to have successful programs. And we're optimistic there's some things going on and outside the U.S. to really evaluate how good this can get. And again, we think the opportunity for improvement is substantial with the existing systems, let alone what you get when you get into next-generation products.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Erickson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Erickson, you may begin.","David Erickson","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release with our third quarter 2013 financial results. On today's call, we will discuss those results and follow our prepared remarks -- and following our prepared remarks, we'll open up for questions. Our presenters today are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Abate, CFO.","Before I turn the call over to Mike, I'd like to remind you that during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, our expectations regarding sales and sales growth, gross profit margin, earnings per share, SG&A, R&D, taxes, free cash flow, diluted shares outstanding, interest expense and foreign currency impacts. These statements also include our current expectations for the timing, status and expected outcomes of our clinical milestones and trials, regulatory approvals, regulatory compliance and reimbursement, as well as expectations regarding market growth and opportunities, the U.S. and Japan launches of SAPIEN products and associated economics, new product introductions, impacts of competition and the timing and impact of patent litigation. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Although we believe them to be reasonable, these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or experiences to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","Information concerning factors that could cause these differences may be found in our press release, our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and our other SEC filings, which are available on our website at edwards.com.","Also as a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and excluding special items, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael A. Mussallem","Thank you, David. This quarter, we're pleased to report strong sales growth driven by transcatheter and surgical heart valves, as well as solid bottom line results. A number of important transcatheter valve developments were among this quarter's highlights, including the approval to begin the U.S. clinical study of our most advanced valve, SAPIEN 3, expanded approval to include alternate delivery approaches for SAPIEN in the U.S., a favorable patent infringement ruling in Germany and the receipt of reimbursement in Japan. This approval means Edwards is the first to offer this novel technology to patients in Japan, which brings our lifesaving therapy to over 60 countries.","Now turning to the quarterly results. Reported sales grew 11% to $496 million. Sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was 13%, driven by transcatheter and surgical heart valves, with a strong contribution from Europe. In transcatheter heart valves, third quarter sales grew 39% to $172 million, driven by the ongoing U.S. SAPIEN launch and strong growth in Europe. In the U.S., THV sales for the quarter grew 56% to $86 million, which included $12 million of clinical sales, but was reduced by $2 million of net stocking.","As we previously projected, activities slowed sequentially due to seasonality, and the impact of consignment conversions exceeded stocking sales.","Clinical sales were driven by enrollment in our PARTNER IIa trial and the ongoing nested registries. We estimate commercial procedures grew 80% over last year. As a reminder, in third quarter last year, net stocking had a favorable $8 million impact to sales. At the end of September, 265 sites in the U.S. offered SAPIEN to their patients.","Overall, we continue to believe that TAVR economics and hospital capacity are not yet optimized at most sites, and there remains significant opportunity for improvement. Our U.S. team is strengthening its capability to educate sites on TAVR economics and share best demonstrated practices from some of the leading U.S. programs. Importantly, nearly 15,000 patients in the U.S. have been treated with our transcatheter heart valves over the past 2 years and clinicians continue to maintain very high procedural success rates.","In September, the FDA approved revised labeling for our SAPIEN valve to include alternate access points in addition to the transfemoral and transapical approaches. This change enables U.S. reimbursement for patients regardless of which implantation approach a physician uses.","Outside the U.S., THV sales grew 25% over last year or 20% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Growth was driven primarily by transfemoral units. We estimate the favorable patent infringement ruling in Germany had negligible impact on sales in the quarter, as affected customers continue to work down inventory of the competitor's product. While more recent competitors had a small impact on this quarter's results, we expect it to be greater in the fourth quarter due to new product approvals.","Now updating our clinical and product development milestones. We're actively working with FDA and continue to expect a mid-2014 U.S. approval for SAPIEN XT with a NovaFlex delivery system and anticipate a rapid introduction will follow. We're proud to announce that we've completed enrollment in Cohort A, the surgical arm of the PARTNER II trial. This is the first randomized study -- first randomized trial to study transcatheter heart valves in moderate risk patients, which has the potential to significantly expand patient access to transcatheter valve technology.","In August, we received FDA approval to expand our PARTNER II clinical trial to include a 500-patient cohort to study 1-year outcomes of our SAPIEN 3 system in high-risk and inoperable patients. Recently, we started enrollment and are excited to bring our most advanced valve delivered through a 14-French eSheath and designed to reduce paravalvular leak to patients in the U.S.","In Europe, we remain on track to receive a CE Mark to launch our SAPIEN 3 valve by year end. We completed an initial clinical experience with our CENTERA valve and expect to begin another clinical series with an enhanced delivery system in the next several months.","During the quarter, we received reimbursement for SAPIEN XT in Japan, which became effective October 1. We've completed our first commercial cases. And since sites are required to undergo a rigorous certification process, we anticipate sales will ramp slowly. We believe transcatheter valve technology will be particularly attractive to Japanese patients, and the introduction of our SAPIEN XT valve in that market should contribute meaningfully to sales beginning next year.","And finally, we received approval in the quarter for SAPIEN in Australia and SAPIEN XT in Canada.","Treating mitral disease with transcatheter technology continues to be one of our primary development efforts, and we still believe a first in human experience with a transcatheter mitral valve is likely in 2013. We expect to provide an update at our December Investor Conference. We are continuing to invest broadly in structural heart disease solutions and have dedicated teams working on multiple therapies.","In our patent litigation with Medtronic, we had 2 significant recent developments: First, in Germany, the court found that Medtronic infringes our Spenser patent. The validity of this patent is still being contested. We posted the necessary bond, putting into effect the court's injunction and recall. Contrary to our interpretation of the court's decision, Medtronic has not instructed hospitals to return product. We've requested further enforcement action by the court, and we anticipate more clarity in the next few weeks.","Second, in our U.S. case involving the Andersen patent, the U.S. Supreme Court has denied Medtronic's request for further review of the case. Edwards' request for a permanent injunction and additional damages are pending before the Delaware trial court, and no timing for these decisions has been established.","In summary, we continue to expect global transcatheter heart valve underlying sales growth of 25% to 30% and are tightening our 2013 sales guidance range to $700 million to $730 million. Included in our assumptions are U.S. sales at the low end of our previous guidance range of $350 million to $400 million and stronger o U.S. performance. In the fourth quarter, we expect minimal impact from the German injunction and the Japan launch.","Now turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy group. Reported sales increased 3% over last year to $192 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales grew 6% compared to the prior year, driven by unit growth. This quarter's growth was led primarily by strong performance in the U.S. and Europe and tempered somewhat by a competitor's launch in Japan. INTUITY contributed approximately 2% to total sales growth.","Globally, our pricing remains steady. ASPs were stable in the U.S. and higher in Europe, due to INTUITY, but offset by geographic mix. In the U.S., sales grew 6.7%. We estimate that we regained share in the quarter and that the market grew in low single digits. We also believe we are beginning to benefit from our recently published long-term durability data.","In Europe, we're making good progress on our key INTUITY milestones. We continue to expect a CE Mark in the near future for INTUITY Elite, our next-generation platform, which has been well received by clinicians for its lower profile. In the U.S., enrollment in our TRANSFORM Trial remains on track, and we now have upgraded all sites to INTUITY Elite. Also in the U.S., we continue to enroll patients in our COMMENCE IDE trial, studying the GLX tissue on our aortic and mitral Magna Ease platforms.","Based on current trends, we are raising the bottom end of our sales growth range in Surgical Heart Valve therapy and now project 3% to 5% underlying growth in 2013.","Turning to the Critical Care product group, total sales of $132 million for the quarter declined 5% over last year. The primary driver of the decline was a foreign exchange impact in Japan. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales increased 1%, as double-digit growth of FloTrac was nearly offset by the continued reduction of distributor inventories in China and the ongoing exit of our Access product line. The incorporation of our noninvasive monitoring technology into our EV1000 platform is continuing, and the integrated product remains on track to be introduced in 2014. This quarter, noninvasive products once again contribute modestly to sales.","We remain enthusiastic about the significant opportunity represented by our GlucoClear system and are encouraged by the progress on our 2013 goals. We completed enrollment in our ICU accuracy study in Europe and expect it to demonstrate compelling results in the hospital setting. We expect to receive further insight on the pathway toward U.S. approval in the fourth quarter.","Based on our year-to-date results, we now expect full year 2013 underlying sales growth for Critical Care product group to be at the bottom of our previously stated 2% to 4% range.","And now I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. Abate","Thanks, Mike. Turning to the financials. This quarter, our strong sales performance in valves allowed us to achieve diluted EPS of $0.68, representing growth of 17% over the prior year. At the same time, we increased our R&D investments by 14%. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares for $250 million and now project fully diluted shares outstanding to be between $111 million and $112 million at year end.","Just after the end of the quarter, we issued $600 million of 5-year notes at 2 7\/8% and fully paid down the $532 million balance on our revolving credit facility.","For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 73.8% compared to 75.1% in the same period last year. The reduction was driven by higher manufacturing costs as we prepare for the SAPIEN XT launch in the U.S. and SAPIEN 3 launch in Europe, as well as the reduced benefit from foreign exchange of 40 basis points. These items were partially offset by a more profitable product mix of 180 basis points. Excluding special items for the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect our gross profit margin to remain at approximately 74%.","Third quarter SG&A expenses were 36.4% of sales or $180 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year. This increase was driven primarily by U.S. and Japan transcatheter valve launch-related expenses and U.S. Medical Device Tax, partially offset by lower incentive compensation and FX. As a percentage of sales, SG&A should decrease in the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect SG&A to be between 36% and 37% of sales for the full year.","We continue to aggressively invest in R&D, and spending in the quarter grew 14% to $84 million or 17% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of additional investments in multiple heart valve clinical studies. For the full year, we continue to expect R&D to be approximately 16% of sales.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $1 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect net interest expense will increase to approximately $4 million to $5 million as a result of the $600 million debt issuance earlier this month. We estimate our recent share repurchases will largely offset the EPS impact of the higher interest expense and, therefore, have a neutral effect on our fourth quarter EPS.","Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 23%, down from 25.9% in the prior year, due primarily to the absence of the federal R&D tax credit last year and favorable reserve adjustments this year. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be at the low end of our 23% to 24% range.","FX rates negatively impacted third quarter sales by $9 million compared to the prior year, driven by the weakening of the yen. Compared to our recent guidance, FX rates negatively impacted EPS by $0.01. At current FX rates, we now expect a $45 million negative impact to full year 2013 sales.","Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $110 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $147 million, less capital spending of $37 million. For 2013, excluding special items, we continue to expect free cash flow to be between $270 million and $310 million.","Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $758 million. Total debt increased to $532 million as a result of our share repurchases during the quarter. Our DSO at the end of the quarter was 58 days and our inventory turns were 1.7, both consistent with the prior quarter.","Turning to our sales and earnings guidance. At current exchange rates, for the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group, we are raising the bottom end of our range now expect -- and now expect sales of $780 million to $810 million. In transcatheter heart valves, we have tightened the range to $700 million to $730 million, which reflects U.S. sales at the low end of our $350 million to $400 million range and stronger o U.S. performance. In the Critical Care product group, we now expect sales at the low end of our previous $530 million to $570 million range.","In summary, we are reiterating our full year guidance, with sales of $2 billion to $2.1 billion and earnings per diluted share excluding special items of $3 to $3.10. For the quarter -- for the fourth quarter of 2013, we project total sales of $520 million to $550 million; and diluted EPS, excluding special items, to be between $0.81 and $0.85.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks, Tom. We continue to project double-digit underlying sales growth in 2013 and believe that our many clinical and commercial accomplishments this year have strengthened our leadership. This positions us well for continued success, and we remain committed to developing innovative technologies in structural heart disease and critical care that provide clinicians with transformational therapies to treat their patients.","Before we open it up with the questions, I'd like to remind you about our 2013 Investor Conference on Monday, December 9, in New York, where we'll provide an update on our new technologies, as well as our outlook for 2014.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David Erickson","Thank you, Mike. If you haven't yet RSVP-ed for our December Investor Conference, you can do so on our website. And as a reminder to those of you who are here in San Francisco for the TCT conference this week, Edwards is hosting an informal breakfast meeting on Thursday morning at the Intercontinental Hotel. Please RSVP for the breakfast by contacting a member of our Investor Relations team.","[Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Mike, maybe if we could spend a minute on the Q4 guidance and how you're thinking about that. If I'm doing the math correctly, I think this quarter, TAVI sales were up 39%. The midpoint of the guidance for Q4 implies about 19%, 20%. The U.S. in particular implies a pretty significant deceleration in growth from what you reported this quarter. So maybe you can talk a little bit about that. And I know there was a lot of stocking in Q4 2012. So maybe if you can talk about just the commercial growth that's implied in kind of the -- in the U.S. guidance.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Larry. Yes, the -- we actually -- we expect a good quarter in the fourth quarter, and I think there's enough guidance out there, with 3 quarters under our belt and you now have our full year expectation. You have a pretty good feel of what we think is going to happen. But yes, if you're just looking at growth rates on a reported basis, you have to take into account what you mentioned, which is the fact that we had a positive net stocking in the fourth quarter of last year that was pretty substantial. Remember, that was the quarter when the Cohort A was approved and transapical came into being. And so that was a boost for the quarter as much in stocking. As you see this quarter, actually, we had negative net stocking and we wouldn't be surprised if it would stay -- it certainly is not going to be the positive driver that it was in the fourth quarter of last year.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just one on mitral, obviously, encouraging commentary from you earlier that you still think the first-in-man is likely this year, only 2 months left in the year. Is there any additional color that you can give us, Mike, on what gives you the confidence that you'll be able to do a first-in-man in 2013? And I'll drop.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, Larry. Yes, as you can imagine, it's quite a process for us to move forward with a first-in-man experience. And I think the good news that you should take away from our continued statement that it's likely this year is that we continue to make progress and to achieve milestones along that way. And we really don't have much more to share. Just wanted to let you know that we're going to provide an update at the Investor Conference in December. And so I'd say, really stay tuned for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mike, just on fourth quarter and Germany. Can you talk just a little bit about the impact there? You said you're not expecting much from Germany and you expect Medtronic to remove its products. How does that balance against the compassionate use that's still allowed and why is there not just greater contribution into the fourth quarter guidance from Germany?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, it's a good point. So just to keep in mind what's going on there, recall that in anticipation of the injunction that Medtronic provided some excess sales, it appears, to their accounts, and I think they acknowledged that. And so there's some inventory that still remains and we believe that, that was being worked off to some extent in the third quarter. There's a difference of opinion on the court's interpretation. We feel that the court expected customers to return product, Medtronic has not ask their customers to do that. And so we've gone back to court to provide clarity in that regard. And further, as you know, we proactively provided for compassionate cases and have a specific set of valves that we thought were appropriate that wouldn't be appropriately treated with an Edwards system. I think Medtronic may have a different interpretation or broader interpretation of that. We're also asking the court for clarity on that point.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And, Mike, just a second question just on U.S. demand. Yesterday at the conference, under the discussion of the TVT Registry in which the speaker said the U.S. market is plateauing at about 250 sites and 800 U.S. procedures per month. Do you have a comment on the U.S. market saturating or plateauing?","Michael A. Mussallem","No, we don't believe that the U.S. market is plateauing. I think the TVT Registry has a substantial look back there. I'm not sure that you're able to really draw conclusions from the collection of that data. And our experience is that there's still a growing market in the U.S., and I think that the results this quarter that we believe that procedures versus third quarter a year ago grew approximately 80% is a pretty good indication that this is not a flat market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","With so much scrutiny on just one aspect of one division of your business, U.S. TAVI, wondering if you could comment about the U.S. business commercial and also including clinical. If -- correct me if I'm wrong, but you -- last year, I think you had somewhere in the mid-single digits from a clinical perspective in terms of contribution to U.S. TAVI. And this year, it was significantly bigger than that. In our research, some of your bigger clinical centers, in some cases, prefer to enroll patients than to implant with the a -- in commercial setting, given the different innovations, the different products that they have access to. So how would you have us look at your U.S. business? I know you gave commercial sales growth, but should we include clinical in that, given the phenomenon of clinical centers, perhaps in some cases, preferring to enroll than to implant in commercial?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, Jason. Yes, as you pointed out, there were significant clinical sales this quarter, larger than they've been in the past, particularly because there was pretty stout enrollment of the PARTNER II trial with SAPIEN XT. And if you just step back, I think a reasonable way to think about this is those cases that are being done clinically could very well have been done commercially. And I like to look at the total number of procedures that are happening and think that clinical volume should be sort of added to the commercial volume when you consider what is the demand that's in the marketplace. So I think that's a correct observation. We expect the clinical demand to stay pretty robust here in the future. And you have to remember that there's also competitive clinical demand as well. So I think that's worth taking into account when you think about just how big the market is or how fast it's growing.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","That's helpful. And my follow-up would stay with U.S. TAVI. I know you're not ready at this point to give your 2014 expectations. But perhaps you could give us a sense for how you're building that up and what variables you see as the biggest drivers to growth in your U.S. business next year in terms of how you're building up the number of synergy think [ph] will contribute to that number. And then utilization rates just juxtaposed to your experience in Europe in your 3 there versus what you may expect here in terms of utilization, how that might trend next year.","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure. Well, I think one of the things that we indicated is over time, the impact of stocking and consignment will diminish. And so we think that'll be a less pronounced effect in 2014 than it is in 2013. You're right, we're not going to give specific guidance about 2014. But the high procedural success rate gives us confidence that we've got a very robust and growing procedure base, and that will continue. And one of the biggest headwinds, I think, to growth so far has been some of the economic concerns, and those just continue to improve over time. We still have a young procedure. And that is, we believe, getting considerably better on a consistent basis. And so we think that's really what will provide the underlying lift for continued growth next year. And as you point out, in Europe, here we are -- this is the sixth year after introduction, and Europe just had a growth quarter of about 20%. So pretty remarkable. I know it's maybe the comparison last year was at the depth of some problems in Europe. But nonetheless, it's pretty encouraging to see how that's going.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 2 quick clarifications first. So one, I wasn't sure what the fourth quarter full year U.S. TAVI guidance is now if that had changed. And second, Mike, will we not hear anything on mitral side until the Analyst Meeting? If you could clarify that.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. So yes, on the mitral question, I don't think you should anticipate that you're going to hear things from us until the investor conference. We don't have any plans to report anything at this point. And then, in particular, you're asking about what the guidance is for the remainder of the year?","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, in the U.S -- I know you had the $350 million to $400 million range. But did you change that today?","Michael A. Mussallem","We -- what we said is that you should...","Thomas M. Abate","At the low end.","Michael A. Mussallem","Expect it to be at the low end of that range. Correct. We kept the overall global range the same because of the stronger o U.S. performance.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. And then just one question. I don't know if you caught Datreek's [ph] comments yesterday on the TVT Registry. I felt like he let a little something slip out of the bag ahead of the publication. But he said that 25% of the implants to date, and this is in the first 50 to 700 cases, had STS scores below 5. Is that possible? That just didn't seem right to me, but I was hoping you would know the data better than we would.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I don't know about that, Mike, we understand that they are struggling to enroll that trial. And I think that probably as a result, that there's a...","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, I'm not talking about SURTAVI. Mike, I'm not talking about SURTAVI. I'm talking about the TVT Registry.","Michael A. Mussallem","Oh, the Registry, oh the TVT. Are you talking about the U.S. or European data?","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, no. U.S. TVT Registry.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, that doesn't sound likely to us. We're not sure that STS captures all the factors. Sometimes what confounds that is the frailty or porcelain aorta. So maybe that's confounding the statistics. But broadly, we think people are pretty disciplined about the way that they utilize the valves.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to come back to the surgical valve business, which you kind of glossed over a little bit in your prepared remarks though you did see somewhat of a turn in that business. So I'm hoping you could walk us through in a little bit more detail what's happening with that franchise. To what extent, if any, are centers seeing a pull-through effect from having TAVI programs in the U.S.? And then how shall we think about the surgical valve business going forward from a cannibalization standpoint?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Thanks very much. The -- we're -- we still believe that there will be a halo, although we just haven't seen substantial impact on our results so far. The growth this quarter was unit growth. And so we believe that the market was probably growing in low single digits, and that we also had share increase, I think, as we're regaining share in the U.S. is part of that. We saw growth both in THV accounts and non-THV accounts this quarter. So both sort of lifted. So we're pretty optimistic about our surgical heart valve franchise in terms of where it is right now. Does that answer your question?","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Now -- and then I guess your -- the corollary question to that would be if you're not seeing much of a halo effect or pull-through effect, why wouldn't this business see increased pressure over time as the sort of PARTNER A group starts to pick up as a percentage of total units?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, it's a good question. And we'll get deeper into that at the Investor Conference. But big picture is yes, there will be some pressure and some cannibalization, of course. But we think that the awareness of aortic stenosis is going to increase. It's a largely untreated population, and that there are likely to be more people that flow into the system. And so we'll get a boost from that. And so we're not sure that it's just purely a subtractive effect.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right, got it. And maybe just for Tom on the P&L, just a clarification around the moving parts in the gross margin line, could you maybe first give us some perspective, what was sort of the underlying or sort of real gross margin this quarter? And then how long do we see this headwind from inventory build?","Thomas M. Abate","Yes, that's a good question. I think we're going to see the inventory effects throughout the launch. It's going to continue into 2014. When exactly? I don't have a date. But there's a number of things that are involved with the training and inventory and so forth. So I think that's likely to continue into the future. I'd say this -- the benefit -- we're still seeing some benefit in this quarter from FX, if you just isolate the current quarter. But that's pretty much gone by next quarter. So we had a strong first half. Remember, we were getting help, 150 to 100 basis points. We also had a real strong benefit last year, second half. So -- but that's tapering down. Now, of course, as you wrap around rates, whenever you have a big movement, that's pretty normal until the next movement. So predicting FX, we'll take another shot at it in December but it's always a variable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray.","Misha Dinerman","This is actually Misha Dinerman for Brooks. I was just wondering, Mike, if you could give us an update on TA training and how the rollout there is going, how many of the sites have been now set up with training? And...","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks. I think at this point, great, great majority. I don't know the exact number. But my estimate would be 95% or more of sites in the U.S. are trained on transapical approach.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, one of the consternations about the stock is the view that the U.S. market, given the constraints of the NCD, can't really grow that fast until there's indication expansion. And that given the emergence of competitors and just trialing efforts that are going on in clinicals, that it's going to be difficult for Edwards to grow the U.S. TAVI business reliably in '14 and '15. And just kind of schematically, how do you respond to that? And is there anything we should be thinking about that we're maybe missing?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. We continue to be optimistic about the U.S. market. I think the improving economics will be gradual, but I think they will be deliberate, and we'll see that. And we think as economics improve, that it will stimulate hospitals to increase their capacity and to further develop their referral networks. So that's just the -- it would be an underlying boost. Remember, we expect a SAPIEN XT approval next year, which we think is also very helpful and that [ph] comes along with additional sizes. So we think that also helps increase the number of patients that you might touch in the United States compared to just the SAPIEN technology that's there today.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Mike, my follow-up is about the kind of hospital profitability situation. And just to put a clarifying point on it, if a patient is mapped to the correct MS-DRG and you can reduce length of stay with kind of discharge to home, that in your mind really will allow the hospital to kind of pocket more of the profit and there won't be some recoupment on the part of CMS?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I think that's right. Overall, we believe that profitability is not only improving, we think that most hospitals today are profitable on a per procedure basis. And as they improve their economics, for example, improve their length of stay and have proper discharge planning, yes, the benefit comes to the hospitals.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Swann.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Mike, I was hoping I could follow up on the mitral program. Sorry to harp on this, but can you give us any color on sort of what are the milestones that still need to be hit before we can go first-in-man? And then secondly, to follow up on that, how quickly can this go from first-in-man into a pivotal CE Mark trial.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. We really haven't gone to the point where we lay out the specific milestones. I think as we mentioned, we go through quite a process. Our -- all of our in vitro tests, as well as the early preclinical tests that we would do, both on acute animals and chronic animals, it's quite a process. And I don't know that it's appropriate to get into that in a deliberate way. I -- we think there's a lot to learn in a first-in-man. There are no great models for really doing this in the mitral position. And so I think getting in front of ourselves would be inappropriate. We're going to try and bring this more to life when we're with you at the Investor Conference. And so we'll try and get much deeper. But I think at this point, we'll hesitate to make any projections beyond that we think it's likely that we're going to get in the first-in-man, and we look forward to that experience.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And I was hoping you could comment on your Q4 guidance and for o U.S. THV sales and how you're factoring in. Just this -- earlier this morning, a competitor got a next-gen valve, a CE Mark approval. So how are you thinking about the competitive ramping up in Q4, particularly since you don't expect a benefit from Medtronic and Germany quite yet?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks. We've been really pleased with both the -- what the market's been doing in Europe and also our performance compared to competitors. And that's gone very well. And we felt like we leave the third quarter with a lot of momentum. I think what was just approved this morning is no surprise to us. This is fully what we expected, and that's fully anticipated in our guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions here. Mike, just on XT, maybe a couple of questions. First, the timing you're giving for mid-next year seems a little longer than maybe some more optimistic expectations, considering that it's not a novel valve. Maybe just give us a sense of could that estimate actually prove conservative and what your thoughts are there. And then secondarily, I'd love to know kind of how you think about XT in the U.S. in terms of being able -- as a key growth driver next year, can it really drive increased growth? Or do you see XT as a valve that likely cannibalizes a lot of TA procedures? So those 2 points, both the FDA process and how you see XT play on next year as a growth catalyst.","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks, David. I think we need to bring you with us to the next FDA meeting, so you can explain to them that XT is not a novel valve and that they should rapidly move to approve this. We try to make similar arguments but they're pretty convinced that it is a unique and novel valve. And we're pretty pleased. We think that profile change is going to be substantial. I'm not sure everybody really thinks about the difference of moving from a 24-French system to an 18-French eSheath. That's a big change that customers are going to go through, and I think it's going to have a big impact on patients. In addition, I also mentioned that we have -- we'll have a range of sizes that are significant, and that will make a difference as well. There are patients that are being excluded today because we can't serve them with a 23 and 26 millimeter size.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, Tom, just maybe a quick follow-up on gross margins. Obviously, this year, there's a significant series of launches in multiple markets, which are pressuring GMs. Next year, you start to anniversary some of those launches, but we kind of gear up for the U.S. push of XT. I mean, is XT in the U.S. is going to have the same type of inventory pressure that we're seeing here in '13, or can we sort of expect the broader mix of your business with the multiple countries driving per valve to maybe take those GMs higher? So I'm just trying to get a sense of whether the pressures we're seeing in the back half of '13, are we going to see them again in '14 because of XT? Or the net benefit should be GMs heading higher?","Thomas M. Abate","Yes, it's difficult to predict. We need to get the actual approval dates behind us and see how these launches are actually going to work, how aggressively, we'll look at inventory in both cases. But our goal is to get everything that we can outside the U.S. to XT, including the U.S. So it will give us some efficiencies. Obviously, S3 will be the leader. But next year, it's probably mainly Europe that we're looking at. So being able to drop SAPIEN should help. I don't know how quickly we would see that benefit, probably a little bit of time before we get that work through the system because we do still have some -- we'd still have SAPIEN in some indications in the U.S.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, maybe I'll just to add to Tom's answer that although we do pick up efficiency when we'd leave SAPIEN and go to XT, we will be producing a more expensive SAPIEN 3 valve as we move forward, so...","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just as a follow-up to that last one, just in terms of the SAPIEN XT label. Have you changed your view on -- or expectation that it will be not only approved for the inoperable patient population but also for high risk? So I'm just confused as to how you would then be able to transition everything over to SAPIEN XT without that label also specifying high risk.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. No, we haven't changed our view. Of course, we would love to have the label be not only inoperable but high risk. But at this point, we don't have any reason to be able to really provide any guidance on that, Kristen. It -- the trial provide -- you're familiar with where -- what the trial tested.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And so I guess, if it doesn't change, then, I guess, we could continue to see some of this inventory pressure in gross margins because you'll have to have both product lines continue in the U.S. until presumably PARTNER IIa results and approval.","Michael A. Mussallem","I think that your broad assumption is correct. If that were to persist, then we would have to keep SAPIEN going as well as XT, as well as SAPIEN 3. That would sort of hurt our efficiencies, and we'd feel that in the margin.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit more on just the Japanese market. I know you had mentioned that you expect the ramp to be a little bit slower. Can you maybe just help us get a little bit more perspective just on the number of centers you're looking at there; what, in particular, is causing the slower ramp, what centers need to be credentialed for or anything in that regard?","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure. So the -- we've already begun training centers. But there -- in addition to what Edwards typically does, there's an additional criteria that was established by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Japan and medical societies for there actually to be a certification that would be done by local physician societies. And that is an additional gating item and would need to be done along the way. So what we're concerned is it will make the launch actually even more deliberate. So it will be -- provide a slower ramp than if we had -- if we didn't have that requirement in there. Now having said that, we think this is going to be a very popular procedure in Japan, and ultimately, it's going to grow very nicely. But I think this additional requirement is going to mean that it's going to go slower. So even though we've trained some centers, for example, I'll doubt that we'll have an additional 10 centers trained in the fourth quarter.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I missed in the beginning, but how many centers are in the U.S. right now?","Michael A. Mussallem","265 at the end of the third quarter.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And do you still feel good about the targets that you had set? It seems like it's tracking a little bit lighter.","Michael A. Mussallem","I'm sorry, Kristen, what was that?","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Do you feel still positive about the number of centers that you expect to add? That number seems to be tracking a little bit lower?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Given where we are right now, it's probably less likely that we reach 300 by the end of the year. But we think, typically, the third quarter is slow. So it's not surprising that it's a little less this quarter than we have experienced in the past. I think we need to let some others ask questions now, Kristen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on Germany and a follow-up on Japan. In Germany, I believe Medtronic's CoreValve was doing somewhere about $15 million to $20 million per quarter. And I guess, what I'm hearing is you're saying in 4Q, they have enough product in the channel that you're not going to be able to really benefit. But how should we think about the benefit in 2014? Can you capture at least 50% to 75% of CoreValve? And then I have a follow-up on Japan.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, it's a really good question, Glenn. When we said there was minimal impact this quarter, actually our local team actually thinks there might have been even slightly negative impact, as they're still working off quite a bit of this competitive inventory. Before we can make a call on how things might go in the future, I think we're going to need these decisions from the courts. Because the courts will tell us a couple of things: One is whether there is going to be a recall of the products that are still on the shelf; and two, just how rigorous this definition of compassionate is. We think it's quite rigorous. And again, we've tried to be generous with the idea that we're really going to do the very best for patients and their physicians, but that's not clear. So we would expect over the next several weeks to have some decisions there that help clarify that, but it's not perfectly clear right now, Glenn.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And I would assume we'll get the update at the Analyst Day, correct?","Michael A. Mussallem","Certainly.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then in just Japan, can you remind me, I believe in the past you've said no stock in Japan, just consignment. Is that correct?","Michael A. Mussallem","That is correct. We're going to go directly to consignment model in Japan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just a couple of quick follow-ups. First of all, on the U.S. side, can you give us a sense as to what you expect in terms of Q4 revenue from the -- from clinical trials for U.S. TAVI? And then to follow-up on the question on number of centers in the U.S., I was wondering if you could comment on are you still comfortable longer term that you can have, really, 400 centers up and running, ultimately. Or is that number now lower? Because that certainly was what some of the commentary was yesterday in a few of the sessions.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. So -- the -- so let me -- I'm trying to...","Thomas M. Abate","Q4 clinical...","Michael A. Mussallem","Oh, yes. So Q4 clinicals, we hesitate to make predictions about what clinical cases will be in the quarter. We think that there will continue to be some pretty good clinical volume, with SAPIEN 3 beginning in the PARTNER II trial. We think that will be pretty popular. So that could drive some pretty rapid uptake, but it's difficult for us to predict exactly where that comes out. In terms of the number of sites, yes, you're right. Given that we're at 265, it does call into question on whether we'd get to 400 by the end of next year. We're going through that analysis now. We'll try and give maybe a sharper picture of that when we get to the Investor Conference. But your observation is a good one.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So -- and then just as a follow-up, on the clinical trial revenue, I know you don't want to give an exact number for Q4, but should we assume it's roughly the same as what that is right now? And then my last follow-up is simply, do you have any update for us in terms of your expectations for a decision from the European Patent Office on validity?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Bob. Well, I admire your persistence on trying to get a clinical number out of us in the fourth quarter, but I think we're going to hesitate to offer that up. I think I pretty much offered the best insight that I can. In terms of the Spenser patent, we would expect the European Patent Office to make a decision in the first half of '14 on the validity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So just wanted to ask a question about SAPIEN 3. You've got -- your launch expected here early next year and you're also due some additional clinical work in the U.S. So first question is you mentioned the clinical trial, I guess, drain on commercial volumes in the U.S. And I'm curious as to how you see that evolving sequentially. Meaning, you got a lot of clinical stuff going on, but you mentioned before there's more competitive clinical trials going on at the same time. So do you think that you'll actually see more clinical sales for Edwards or less because of that dynamic?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Well, I guess, I'd say that we're really excited about SAPIEN 3. We think it's a terrific valve. We think clinicians are super excited about it. And the opportunity for them to implant in the U.S., especially in these leading centers that are in the PARTNER II trial, is going to be exciting to them, and we expect them to move along at a pretty rapid pace. I don't know how fast that's going to go. Naturally, they need to go back through their IRBs, which they do for any of these changes. I don't expect that to be onerous, but it's still a requirement. So it's tough to make the call exactly how fast that is. But we'd expect it to enroll pretty fast, and that would drive the clinical sales number up. Having said that, whether it's clinical sales or commercial sales, we're relatively indifferent. This is -- as long as we're making progress here in terms of moving the best system forward and that the therapy is continuing to grow and be popular and help patients, we're very pleased with that.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then just a follow-up on the centers. There's been some speculation about the total number, ultimately. Can you comment on the centers that you've trained so far? Have you retained all those centers, is your batting average pretty high there? And have any centers dropped off because of one reason or another?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. I don't know any exact numbers in terms of exactly what's going on. We don't tend to have centers that so-call drop off that I'm aware of at any serious numbers. I'm sure there are exceptions here and there. But for the most part, I think people try and meet their minimum requirements to stay within the NCD.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities.","Suraj Kalia - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","So Mike, if I may piggyback on the question about Germany and inventory for CoreValve? I think sort of this why do you expect it that you're going to follow the same pattern in some the other countries, whether it's Italy, U.K., so on and so forth? Can you give us some perspective of if you will try to preempt any of the inventory issues with CoreValve, assuming in some of the other countries you'll go for litigation with the Spenser patents? And would the German court set a precedent in some of the other countries, also the interpretation?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. I think the other countries do pay attention to what the German courts do. But I hesitate to do any projection. We just don't comment on future litigation, Suraj. And so we really have nothing to share at this point.","Suraj Kalia - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Fair enough. One more question, Mike, and forgive me if this is a too forward-looking question. Obviously, a lot of the centers in the U.S. complain about profitability about TAVI. I think a lot of the centers that we talked to have consistently started giving feedback that the perioperative and immediate post op outcomes have improved substantially, but that the cost effectiveness is just killing them. Do you think given all the competitive clinical trials coming on board, do you -- what does your internal analysis suggest in the price elasticity of demand on the commercial side for your products? Do you think it's a viable strategy at this time in terms of causing a step-change in the demand curve?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Just broadly, we think -- although everybody's not there at this point, we think more than half of the centers are profitable just on a per procedure basis today, and that, that is improving. And we've seen that results in the early data that we've had a chance to look back, the MEDPAR data. And we are feeling that in our own experiences. In terms of our pricing and the role in that, we think our pricing is fair and we think it does a good job of reflecting the value of the procedures. Even if you go back to The PARTNER Trial and Cohort B and remember that cost effectiveness versus other cardiovascular procedures, it was pretty comparable. And when you consider that it's a young procedure and that there's a large opportunity for improvement, we think we're pretty well positioned for that to continue to get better over time, especially as we're able to bring better systems that are going to be easier for patients and their physicians.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Mike, 2 things. First, briefly, I hate to ask or even think about Mike's departure but -- Tom's departure, but any update on timing of the CFO search?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. The CFO search is going really well, Rick. We're going to be sorry to say goodbye to Tom as well. He's been a fantastic partner. He's continued to be highly engaged, and so we expect a very smooth transition. I think that we'll have something announced certainly before year end, hopefully even sooner than that. So just stay tuned, but that's all going well.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Good. CENTERA, a couple of questions to finish for me. You said you're starting a second trial. Maybe a couple of things around CENTERA, Mike, and you could just take it at whatever order you want. What does this all imply for a new trial, a second trial applied for EU approval? Do you think you can still come to market in 2014? You talked about a new delivery system. I think you said it went by sort of quickly. And maybe any larger reflections as the repositionable era grows closer?","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure, Rick. So yes, we're really excited about the CENTERA valve. We think it has the potential to be by far the best-in-class, self-expanding system. We decided to make a pretty significant change to the delivery system, and so we're going to start the trial with a new delivery system here in the next several months. And that will pick up the clinical cases. I -- we don't have any timing to project. Maybe we'll have some things that we can talk about at the Investor Conference, but we're pleased with the direction that this is going in, and we're really looking forward to starting this next series of patients.","Okay.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Erickson, Vice President and Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Erickson, you may begin.","David Erickson","Welcome and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading we released our second quarter 2012 financial results. During today\u2019s call we\u2019ll discuss the results included in the press release and the accompanying financial schedules and then use remaining time for Q&A.","Our presenters on today\u2019s call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO and Tom Abate, CFO.","Before I turn the call over to Mike, I\u2019d like to remind you that during today\u2019s call we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions, and projections. These statements include, but aren\u2019t limited to, our expectations regarding sales and sales growth, gross profit margin, net income growth, earnings per share, SG&A, R&D, taxes, free cash flow, diluted share outstanding and foreign currency impacts. These statements also include our current expectations for the timing, status and expected outcomes of our clinical trials, regulatory submissions and approvals and new product introductions as well as expectations regarding market growth and potential impacts of supply interruptions, economic conditions and competitive products.","These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Although we believe them to be reasonable these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to or experiences to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","Information concerning factors that could cause these differences may be found in our press release, our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and our other SEC filings which are available on our website at Edwards.com.","Also a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and excluding special items, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise we are referring to our GAAP results. Information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s press release.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?","Michael Mussallem","Thank you, David. Even in a challenging economic environment this quarter we reported strong growth in sales driven by the continued success of our US transcatheter heart valve launch. As the number of US safety and procedures grows rapidly we\u2019re extremely pleased with the continued high procedural success rate being achieved.","During the quarter we also cleared two significant milestones, the favorable FDA panel evaluating safety and for high risk surgical patients and the issuance of the final NCD defining US reimbursement.","Turning to quarterly results, reported sales grew 12% to $482 million driven by the US launch of SAPIEN. Sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange was 16%. With the THV launch, US sales grew 37% and represent a growing proportion of our total sales. In the second quarter surgical heart valve therapy products group sales were $201 million which includes $29 million from Cardiac Surgery Systems.","Surgical heart valve sales of $172 million where down 3% or 1% on an underlying basis. The sales trend in the US was comparable to last quarter while sales growth outside the US declined. Globally our pricing remains solid. In the US a competitor\u2019s product introduction last year continued to impact sales growth this quarter. We expect this impact to diminish in the second half of 2012 as we pass the anniversary of that product\u2019s introduction.","In Europe the ongoing economic conditions in Southern Europe weighed more heavily on our results. In Japan, the ongoing conversion of customers to our newly approved Magna Mitral EASE valve was tempered by the recent approval of a competitor\u2019s aortic valve. We expect these somewhat offsetting impacts to continue in Japan for the remainder of the year.","During the quarter we initiated a voluntary recall outside the US of specific lots of heart valves due to a problem with the package equipment in our European manufacturing facility. The majority of the effective products were still in our possession. We promptly communicated with customers and regulators and supply was not interrupted. And most importantly we are confident this did not impact patient safety. The disposition of the effective inventory resulted in a special charge to cost of goods this quarter. We do not anticipate any additional financial impact.","Turning to our cadence and foundation post approval studies of INTUITY, we are currently training centers and expect all of the centers to be enrolling in the fourth quarter. These studies are focused on generating data supporting the patient benefits and health economics of this new procedure compared to traditional open heart surgery. We are very pleased with the pace of enrollment of our TRITON trial, a CE Mark study of our next generation INTUITY system in Europe which features enhancements to both the delivery system and the valve. We continue to expect to complete enrollment this year.","We received a CE Mark in May for Magna EASE with GLX, our next generation tissue platform, and are continuing to gain clinical experience. GLX is a proprietary technology designed to provide additional protection for Bovine pericardial tissue by enhancing anti-calcification for improved durability, and ultimately could be applied to our surgical and transcatheter heart valve platforms.","We are very excited about our US surgical valve pipeline and pleased to have recently received two conditional IDE approvals from the FDA. First we received clearance to initiate the TRANSFORM trial, a prospective, multi-center study that will evaluate the INTUITY valve system. The transform trial, which is expected to begin enrolling in the third quarter, will be a single arm study that will follow standard heart valve guidance and historical controls. We expect to enroll approximately 650 patients.","In June, we received approval to begin an IDE study in the US of our Magna EASE surgical valve using GLX. Like the INTUITY study, the GLX study will also follow standard heart valve guidance and control, and we expect to begin enrollment later this year.","Cardiac Surgery Systems sales for the quarter were $29 million, up 6% or 8% on an underlying basis. This quarter\u2019s growth was driven by strong sales of our MIS product line aided by the US and European launch of our IntraClude aortic occlusion device. We spent much of the quarter upgrading existing customers to this new MIS technology.","As expected, late last month we received regulatory approval in the US and Europe for our ProPlege retrograde cardioplegia device designed to protect the heart during aortic and mitral valve MIS procedures. Early clinician feedback from the limited launch has been positive and we plan to broaden the launch in the third quarter.","In summary, given our first half performance in the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group we now expect to achieve underlying sales growth for the full-year at the low end of our previous 3% to 5% range. Second half growth rates are expected to approve as prior-year comparisons moderate.","Turning to transcatheter heart valves, second quarter sales were $146 million, 71% growth or 83% underlying growth over last year driven by the US launch of SAPIEN. Transfemoral systems which represent more than 75% of our global THV sales continue to be lifted by the US commercial ramp which is entirely TF and the launch of our 29mm system in Europe. Outside the US our sales grew 6%. On an underlying basis sales grew 15% which we estimate was also the approximate growth rate of the market. Continued strong growth in Germany was tempered by negative growth in Southern Europe and a sharp decline in procedures in the Netherlands.","Product pricing remains stable and we now expect this years market growth in Europe to be 15% to 20%. We received a CE Mark mid-quarter and off to a strong start with our 29mm SAPIEN XT valve with NovaFlex plus transfemoral delivery system. Sales were more than $7 million including approximately $2 million of stocking. Late in the quarter we received a CE Mark for our Ascendra Plus delivery system for both the Transapical and a new transaortic approach. These approvals will provide heart teams in Europe with a even broader array of patient options that are expected to drive stronger growth in the second half.","Turning to the US, we\u2019re very pleased to report robust US sales of $61 million for the quarter. Commercial sales were $53 million with about 25% coming from net stocking units which represents stocking sales less consignment. As we broaden consignment net stocking units are expected to contribute less to sales. So this interest in our SAPIEN program remains very high and with the final NCD release in May, hospitals now have a better understanding of the requirement for becoming a TAVR center. From launch to the end of the second quarter we have trained more than 110 centers and are confident we\u2019ll train 150 to 250 commercial sites by the end of the first year of launch.","In June we were very pleased to receive a strong endorsement by the FDA advisory panel recommending approval of our SAPIEN Heart Valve via transfemoral and Transapical delivery for high risk patients. While we hope for a more rapid approval our financial guidance assumes an approval time line for Cohort A that is comparable to the approval time line for Cohort B last year. Upon approval we will use some of our training capacity to rapidly train our existing customers on the Transapical approach.","Turning to our US PARTNER II clinical study, which is evaluating our SAPIEN XT technology, we\u2019re continuing to enroll patients in Cohort A, the surgical arm. We remain on track to complete enrollment by mid-2013. Enrollment in two of the four nested registries of PARTNER II was completed this quarter which contributed to the clinical sales we reported.","In Europe we\u2019re making significant strides with our two important new lower profile transcatheter valve platforms that we believe will enable us to reach more patients and further extend our leadership position. Promising first in human data for CENTERA and SAPIEN 3 were presented at two major meetings during the quarter, and clinician interest is very high. Of note were the results for SAPIEN 3 which demonstrated very high procedural success and an extremely low incidence of paravalvular leak.","Turning to our CE Mark trials, enrollment in our clinical study for our repositionable and self-expanding CENTERA valve began in June and we continue to expect trial enrollment for our next generation balloon expandable SAPIEN 3 to begin by year end. In Japan, we remain on track to receive regulatory approval and reimbursement for SAPIEN XP in 2013.","In May, we initiated the PROTAVI trial in Europe to study the costs of stroke and evaluate our Embrella device. The initial results of this study should become available by the end of this year. In our THV litigation we continue to expect a decision any time now on Medtronic\u2019s appeal of the willful infringement verdict against them in 2010. Given the strong second quarter performance we now expect $240 million to $260 million of full-year THV sales in the US. Additionally, we now expect global THV sales in the range of $550 million to $600 million with an underlying growth rate of 80% to 90%.","Turning to Critical Care product group, total sales for the quarter were $136 million which included $13 million from vascular products. Within this product group, Critical Care sales were $123 million for the quarter, down 4% or 1% on an underlying basis. Growth of our Advanced Technology Disposable products were offset by both lower sales of hardware in the US and a reduction of distributor inventory in China. Additionally, sales were impacted by approximately $1 million due to a voluntary recall in May of certain lots of Swan-Ganz catheters. These catheters had a lumen that impeded guide wire usage which led to clinician inconvenience but not a patient safety concern.","We\u2019re pleased to announce that we launched globally our next generation EV1000 monitor at the end of the quarter. This marked the full introduction of this platform in Japan where we expected to have a significant impact. With respect to our glucose program we are completing product validations on our enhanced GlucoClear system and remain on track to receive a CE Mark before the end of the year. Total reported vascular sales which is comprised of our Fogarty products were at $13 million this quarter down slightly from the prior quarter. Given the first half performance we are lowering our full year 2012 underlying sales growth rate in the critical care product group to 2% to 5%. We expect improved performance from advanced monitoring in the second half of the year lifted by the launch of our newest EV1000 platform.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Abate","Thank you, Mike. This quarter our strong gross profit rate combined with a favorable tax rate allowed us to achieve diluted EPS of $0.57 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.67. A 37% increase over the prior year. At the same time we increased our R&D investments by 14%. For the quarter our gross profit margin was 73.1% and included an $8 million charge to reflect the estimated cost of our voluntary recalls of Heart Valves and critical care catheters. Excluding the impact of the charge our gross profit margin was 74.8% compared to 70.4% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven by the impact of foreign exchange and favorable product mix primarily driven by the US launch of SAPIEN.","For 2012 the continuation of these factors is expected to further strengthen our gross profit margin. For full year 2012 excluding special items we now expect a gross profit margin between 74% and 75%. Second quarter SG&A expenses were $182 million or 37.8% of sales, an increase of 12% over the prior year. This increase was driven primarily by US transcatheter launch related investments. As a percentage of sales SG&A should trend up in the third quarter due to seasonality and decrease to approximately 37% in the fourth quarter. For the full year we are now narrowing the range of expected SG&A to be between 37% and 38% of sales.","R&D investments in the quarter grew 14% to $74 million or 15.4% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of investments in PARTNER II, and new product development efforts in our transcatheter valve programs. For full year 2012 with the investments in further clinical studies we now expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be between 15% and 16%.","During the quarter we recorded a $7 million in process R&D charge related to licensing agreements for two development stage technologies. Combined with an $8 million charge impacting our gross profit margin special items this quarter reduced diluted EPS by $0.10. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%. While the rate is significantly higher than last year, it is lower than expected as a result of a more favorable regional mix than anticipated. Excluding special items, we expect our rate to be approximately 26% next quarter and drop to approximately 20% in the fourth quarter assuming renewal of the federal R&D tax credit.","FX rates negatively impacted second quarter sales by $14 million. Relative to our prior guidance, FX did not have a material impact on earnings in the quarter. Looking forward at current rates, foreign exchange will have an approximate $60 million negative impact to full-year sales compared to last year.","Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $126 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $147 million, less capital spending of $21 million. For full-year 2012 excluding special items, we continue to expect free cash flow to be between $240 million and $260 million. During the quarter we spent approximately $53 million on share repurchases. For modeling purposes we now project fully diluted shares outstanding to approximately $119 million in 2012.","Turning to our balance sheet, we had total cash and cash equivalence and short term investments of $506 million and total debt of $185 million. Short term investments were $202 million representing highly liquid bank timed deposits. Our DSO at the end of the quarter was 59 days, a five day improvement from the prior quarter as a result of significant payments received in Spain. Inventory turns were 2.0 compared to the first \u2013 were comparable to the first quarter.","Turning to our 2012 sales guidance, at current exchange rates for surgical heart valve therapy we now expect sales to be between $775 million and $805 million which includes approximately $115 million of cardiac surgery system sales. In transcatheter hearth valves we now expect sales of $550 million to $600 million. Lastly in critical care we now expect sales of $550 million to $580 million which includes approximately $50 million of vascular sales. Given our updated projections and the recent movement in foreign exchange rates we now expect full year sales of $1.9 billion to $1.97 billion which represents an underlying growth rate of approximately 20%. Excluding special items we now expect diluted EPS of $2.60 to $2.68 and continue to expect full year 2012 net income growth of approximately 30%. For the third quarter we project total sales of $465 million to $485 million and diluted EPS excluding special items to be between $0.57 and $0.61.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mike.","Michael Mussallem","Thanks, Tom. We remain on track to deliver strong sales growth and bottom line performance this year even with a challenging global economy. We expect our transcatheter technologies to continue to drive our growth well into the future. Also, we remain enthusiastic about the potential of our robust product pipeline to benefit even more patients and strengthen our leadership position. Before we open it up to questions I want to encourage you to mark your calendars for Tuesday, December 4th where we will be hosting our 2012 Investor Conference at our corporate headquarters here in Irvine, California. This event will include updates on our new technologies as well as our outlook for 2013. More information will be available in the next couple of months.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to David.","David Erickson","Thank you, Mike. In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions please re-enter the queue and we\u2019ll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the hour.","Operator, we\u2019re ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen at this time we will begin a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jason Mills from Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Mills \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Thanks, Mike, for taking the question. Congrats on the good quarter in TAVI. Let\u2019s start there if you don\u2019t mind. Perhaps you could give us a bit more color on the differences in utilization early on between the partner sites and the sites you\u2019ve been adding. And then reiterating your guidance for number of centers this year \u2013 new center adds \u2013 as you think about over the next couple of years perhaps refresh our memory as to what you expect in terms of TAVI sites in the next couple of years.","Michael Mussallem","Okay. Thanks, Jason. Yeah. One of the things to keep in mind \u2013 I know it\u2019s a tough thing to deal with averages and I will make some generalizations but there\u2019s a fairly large disparity between accounts, whether it\u2019s partner sites or the new sites. And so there are some of those that tend to get quite large and others that are smaller. But having said that \u2013 it\u2019s kind of interesting. We\u2019ve got quite a bit of balance. There\u2019s still growth in the partner sites. They are strong and growing. And having said that, we got a similar amount of growth probably from our new sites. They\u2019re ramping up and we\u2019re getting a significant contribution from them as well. Remember, there\u2019s quite a few of those. So we\u2019re seeing usage ramp on both.","In terms of the number of sites, yeah, right now we believe that there are 300 to 400 sites that probably qualify within the NCD. There are others that are interested and are working through the requirements to get there, but that\u2019s where we think we are at this point in time and so we\u2019re pleased on the way the ramp is going.","Jason Mills \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Okay. And then my follow up is in Europe. Obviously you\u2019re being impacted by the macro there as well as the currency movements. What do you see as underlying growth in Europe for TAVI for the second half of the year? And with new competition, are you willing to sort of target a bogey for growth in 2013 with the addition of Japan coming at some point next year presumably as well?","Michael Mussallem","Yeah. Well let\u2019s break it into pieces. First of all, in terms of what we think Europe is going to do, we think Europe might be slightly faster in the second half than it was in the first half. We were estimating overall growth for the year will be somewhere in the 15% to 20% range. And what that is, it\u2019s lifted by companies like Germany where the growth is strong and pulled down by Southern Europe by comparison. In a place like France we know there are some new sites that have been turned on right on the first of July so that will help lift the growth rate to some extent.","Now switching to our performance. We\u2019re really not going to give projections at this point in 2013, Jason. You\u2019re correct that there will be new competition but at the same time we\u2019ve got a robust pipeline, so you\u2019re going to have to wait until we get toward the end of the year and we work through our planning process to give estimates.","Jason Mills \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Thanks, Mike. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Michael Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Let me just start with the gross margin which was obviously very strong in the quarter. Tom, 74% to 75% for full year 2012 and I think you said expanding through the year. Where do you expect to exit in the fourth quarter and how much of that can carry through to 2013?","Thomas Abate","Well you know, Larry, that\u2019s a great question. I\u2019d say there\u2019s a couple of factors that we pointed to both factors continue into the second quarter. So we\u2019ll continue to see an improvement sequentially on product mix. It\u2019s almost 50\/50 between product mix and foreign exchange is actually going to lift the rate in the second half. In the second quarter it was neutral to the rate but as the rates have worsened and the hedge contracts kick in it\u2019s actually going to lift. So it\u2019s partially responsible for the improvement for the full year. And so that portion would be coming and going with hedges. The rest based on product mix is something that we would fully expect to carry into next year.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","Do you expect the gross margin to be higher in 2013 obviously?","Thomas Abate","Than the full year of 2012?","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yes.","Thomas Abate","Yes.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","And second, Mike, would you be willing to tell us a little bit more about the timing in Japan on the first have of 2013, second half of 2013? And any color around the approval and reimbursement process there? And then I\u2019ll drop. Thanks.","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, thanks, Larry. Yeah, as you know, in our view sales don\u2019t pick up appreciably until reimbursement is in place. And reimbursement tends to trail the regulatory approval by up to six months. So a significant amount of time. So I think maybe for modeling purposes if you assume that reimbursement is not in place until the end of 2013 that\u2019s probably a fair assumption.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to just go back and clarify Larry\u2019s question on gross margins. Tom, I think you had said that the FX was neutral in the second quarter. Was that relative to your expectations set from back in April or are you talking year-over-year?","Thomas Abate","Okay. That\u2019s a great clarification point. It\u2019s always going to be in reference to something so FX there\u2019s so many different ways to look at it. What I was trying to reflect there is on the quarter rate, the rate in the quarter, there\u2019s very little impact. On a year-over-year basis it\u2019s a very big difference. But it was primary because last year was suppressed. So as close as the quarter we\u2019re going to see is probably the quarter we just reported in terms of unaffected by foreign exchange. Does that help?","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Can you maybe just quantify what the year to year impact was just for FX relative to product mix? Was that the 50\/50 you were talking about? Or","Thomas Abate","No. I\u2019m sorry. Relative to product mix, you\u2019d probably say \u2013 I think the total was 440 and it\u2019s probably 60\/40, actually leaning, favoring foreign exchange. There was a big difference. There was a big negative hedge impact","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, almost 300 basis points in all of our metrics, yeah.","Thomas Abate","But mix was strong, also.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Perfect. And then just kind of walking through the US sites. I think you mentioned it earlier in the prepared remarks \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, I missed it \u2013 but how many centers did you say you had up and running as of today? And I think you still reaffirmed the 150 to 250 for the first full-year out?","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, Kristen. We didn\u2019t give an update of where we are today; we gave an update at the end of the second quarter and we said at the end of the second quarter, we had trained 110 sites since the approval in November. And we said based on that trend we felt very comfortable with the 150 to 250 being trained by the one-year anniversary.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And that would be in addition to those that were already up and running as a part of PARTNER I and PARTNER II, correct?","Michael Mussallem","That\u2019s correct.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just last question just on ASPs, I think you had mentioned that they\u2019re holding up in Europe. Is that true if you look at just pure price and take away the kind of FX component?","Michael Mussallem","Yes. If you take currency out of it our pricing is very stable, very steady in Europe.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla from Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup","I wanted to start with just a question on Europe. Can you clarify the Netherlands \u2013 you said there was a sharp fall-off there in valves \u2013 and secondly on U.K. \u2013 can you give us an update on how the U.K. is ramping with TAVI given the nice approval?","Michael Mussallem","Okay. Yeah. Let me break it into pieces. First of all in the Netherlands. The Netherlands has not had formal reimbursement. We were expecting, and as a matter of fact the clinicians in the Netherlands were expecting that formal approval would occur at the end of Q1. That didn\u2019t happen and it looks like it could be substantially postponed. And so we\u2019re not expecting it this year. As a result, what happened is rather than seeing a lift in the number of procedures in the Netherlands we actually saw a sharp decline. And so that\u2019s what happened in the Netherlands, and at the same time, the U.K. is growing significantly. The U.K. I think is growing in the neighborhood of \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 close to 40%, but remember we\u2019re coming off a small base there.","Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Thanks, Mike. And just, I can\u2019t imagine Netherland being a big market but can you just give us a rough idea of how big the Netherlands has been for TAVI? And just my quick follow up would be on the 29mm valve. It looks like in the quarter it made up about 10% of your OUS sales. I know it\u2019s ramping. Where do you think this 29mm valve ends up? Thank you.","Michael Mussallem","Okay. So the Netherlands probably down something like $1.5 million year-over-year if that helps calibrate you in terms of dollars.","Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup","Yeah. That\u2019s helpful.","Michael Mussallem","Okay. And the other question, could you say it again please?","Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup","Yeah. The 29mm valve, you said $7 million in revenue in the quarter. Overseas TAVI is about $85 million total so that would be about 9%, 10% of overseas revenue. Where do you think the 29mm valve goes as a percentage of total?","Michael Mussallem","Yeah. We\u2019re not sure, is the short answer. Remember we only had the 29mm in the TA position and so we know some of the volume moved over from TA to TF. We wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s in the 15% range of total as an estimate.","Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Thanks, Mike.","Michael Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan","Thank you. So you have this really strong quarter in SAPIEN sales in the US in particular, and globally it\u2019s a strong SAPIEN performance, and again you raised your guidance in different elements. But your third quarter guidance is a little bit below consensus and so I was hoping maybe you could spend just a little bit more time on the FX impact as we go into the back half of the year down the P&L. And then second, on the R&D spend, because you are increasing your planned spending on R&D for the year to a higher percentage of sales. Can you just talk about where those dollars are going and how we think about returns on those investments? Thanks.","Michael Mussallem","Yeah. Perfect, Mike. Be happy to get into it. First of all, the Street is high on Q3 and I think it\u2019s understandable. If you go back to the slides that we presented at our Investor Conference we sort of \u2013 we try and show you what normal seasonality is and we showed Q3 trending higher than Q2 and that probably was a good signal to the Street. In fact, when the Cohort A approval got delayed approximately a quarter it really took the Q3 numbers down. And then we adjusted those last quarter but we didn\u2019t give specific quarterly guidance and so that\u2019s really what happened in Q3.","In terms of foreign exchange, I think Tom mentioned we think it\u2019s going to have about a $60 million impact, so a growing impact based particularly on how much the euro was moved for the year. Because of what you think a pretty effective hedging program we think it will have minimal impact on our bottom line. It\u2019ll be small but not significant. To get into R&D a little bit, what you\u2019re really seeing ramp up, Mike, are clinical trials. At this point the most substantial of those is the PARTNER II trial and the PARTNER II trial clearly is the most expensive trial that we\u2019ve won. We still have the post approval studies associated with PARTNER and then we\u2019ve got trials like PROTAVI going and starting CENTERA and SAPIEN 3. So the accumulation of those certainly takes spending off and that comes up and then starts peaking sort of in Q4, Q1. If that\u2019s helpful.","Michael Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan","That is helpful. So, Tom, we were debating whether you said $60 million or not for full year FX. So that equates to 5.5% FX headwind in the second half of the year. But you\u2019re indicating that you\u2019ve got that managed for the second half which means that the benefit to your gross margin line will be greater in the second half than what we saw in the second quarter. Is that right?","Thomas Abate","That\u2019s exactly correct.","Michael Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. Any other thoughts...","Thomas Abate","60 is the full year, Mike. Not just the back half. Okay?","Michael Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan","Yes, I know. Understood. But the math I was doing, Mike, was I was netting out with the impact of the first half of the year to get to the second half and basically it ends up being like 5.5%. Okay?","Thomas Abate","Right.","Michael Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. And then we look at Europe and the macro issues in Europe. Are there particular countries, outside of the event that you talked about in the Netherlands, where you have incremental concerns? Either about TAVI reimbursement or about the health of your underlying business recognizing that you called out southern Europe, is as it impacted the full business for Edwards?","Michael Mussallem","Yeah. Thanks, Mike, and probably we need to let other people get in line, but overall as we said, Southern Europe is the biggest drag. With Spain not growing and Italy, which is a pretty substantial country, going slightly negative that certainly is a drag on growth rates. And those we believe are prosperity driven. In terms of countries that don\u2019t have solid reimbursement in place I think the Netherlands and Belgium sort of stand out at this point in time. We expect them to approve it but what they\u2019ve done is sort of make the barriers a little higher here and we\u2019ll work through them. But they\u2019re going slow.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Bruce Nudell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you for taking the question. Mike, terrific launch, clearly. The range of sales in Europe is extraordinarily large. I think you commented 310 to 340. With FX that\u2019s like for Edwards somewhere in between 4% and 24% constant currency. Really just based on your commentary it really doesn\u2019t sound like the low end of that range is even plausible. Could you just give some color around that?","Michael Mussallem","Well, you went through some numbers that we didn\u2019t use exactly. You obviously calculated those, Bruce. We tried to give guidance that we think is pretty realistic. And you\u2019re right, Europe is a mixed bag. You\u2019ve got portions through Europe that just aren\u2019t growing and other portions that are really growing fast like Germany. I don\u2019t know, can you maybe give a more specific question I can answer more clearly, Bruce?","Bruce Nudell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah. I guess I\u2019m just saying that if you take the US guidance of 240 to 260, subtract it from 510 to 600, or 550 to 600, you wind up with 310 and 340. And that results at the very low end of $310 million. A pretty puny growth rate for Edwards which just doesn\u2019t sound very plausible.","Michael Mussallem","Yeah. Well, again, I think our believe here is that we should do even better in the second half of the year than we do in the first half of the year. So depending on how you\u2019re using those ranges whether you take the top one range and apply it to the bottom of the other, I don\u2019t know. You can decide how you want to spread the ranges and the risk around. But overall in Europe we think the second half will be better than the first half because of the introductions of the 29mm TF and the Ascendra Plus system.","Bruce Nudell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Perfect. And just the other question. As we looked at the market again, and if you could just comment on this, is that the issue of bicuspid valves is something we really didn\u2019t consider very much. I know it\u2019s not an absolute contraindication but there\u2019s some evidence that\u2019s it\u2019s a reasonably prevalent condition among people let\u2019s say under 75 who get aortic stenosis surgery. What\u2019s your view on where TAVI is with regards to these bicuspid valves?","Michael Mussallem","Whether it\u2019s applicable for bicuspid valves? Yeah, it\u2019s a congenital condition. So it\u2019s not a big one. It\u2019s also, I would say, not a true contraindication. We have a limited amount of experience there so we probably can\u2019t say anything meaningful about how well TAVI works in bicuspid valve. So that\u2019s probably where we are right now. It\u2019s probably not a big driver of numbers in our future. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll collect data on that and we\u2019ll get a view through things like the TVT registry and some of the registries in Europe. So It\u2019ll be helpful. Ultimately I think there\u2019s no reason to believe we shouldn\u2019t be able to treat those. We just lack data today.","Bruce Nudell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks so much.","Michael Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Glenn Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","Michael Mussallem","Hiya, Glenn.","Glenn Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hey. I had a question on the surgical valve business particularly in the US. It looks like the US came in a little bit lighter again, and Mike, I know you cited competition. But I was wondering, has there been any benefit yet from the SAPIEN pull-through? In other words, patients coming in for SAPIEN not eligible and then going off to surgery? And if there hasn\u2019t been a benefit yet, when should we expect to see it? And then just a quick question on some of these early development stage products that you acquired in the quarter. Anything material, anything you can share with us? That would be great. Thanks.","Michael Mussallem","Okay. Thanks, Glenn. Yeah. In the quarter, probably the US might have been ever so slightly better a trend than it was in the first quarter but we\u2019re still suffering from the fact that we haven\u2019t anniversaried on the competitor\u2019s valve. We\u2019d like to think that we ultimately get a lift out of the transcatheter sites but it\u2019s still early, I think is the short answer to the question.","Remember we said we\u2019d trained 110 new sites and the surgical valve business treats \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 we probably sell to 1,100 sites. So you can picture that there\u2019s more people that certainly that we are selling to that don\u2019t have transcatheters than do. So we\u2019re going to look for that in the future. One thing for sure, we think that Edwards benefits. The combination of transcatheter heart valves plus our surgical heart valves certainly lift.","In terms of the deals that we talked about, we\u2019re not going into extraordinary detail but a couple of things; one relates to some tissue technology, particularly intellectual property we acquired, and the other is of some pretty interesting accessories for MIS for minimally invasive surgery.","Glenn Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thanks for answering my question.","Michael Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you and good evening. Mike, I was hoping you\u2019d talk in a little bit more detail about the impact the NCD\u2019s issuance in early May might have had on your ability to open centers and how that potentially accelerated centers? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re willing to offer any more color. I think at the end of last quarter you had said that you had trained 60 centers on the April 24th call. As of the end of Q1, I think the number you quoted today was 110. So of those 50, how much did the NCD help? And then maybe if you could characterize what that\u2019s done to your training backlog or your pull-through rate and how that influences the balance of the year?","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, thanks. I\u2019ll see if I can provide a little bit of color. Although we said it certainly provided clarity and probably gave some people confidence it also would have probably placed the hurdle out there for other people that became an obstacle. So, overall we probably could have trained a few more sites than we did. We have the capability of probably training more than 20 in a month and you can \u2013 I think your math is correct that we did around 50 in the quarter. So the NCD helped existing sites. It took a lot of uncertainty out and it\u2019s clarified things a lot. But it also for others it gave them a clear target that they have to achieve.","The one portion of the NCD that people are probably most targeted at trying to achieve is the structural heart requirements. That\u2019s a little confusing because to some sites. We still don\u2019t believe the big picture. There\u2019s 300 to 400 sites that probably meet these requirements.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then one of the things that you referenced in your prepared remarks was I think you said something like extraordinarily low rates of procedure complications or can you maybe just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of complication rates and obviously your training program being fairly extensive. How successful has that been in keeping the complication rates to a minimum relative to your expectations?","Michael Mussallem","Yeah. You know we\u2019re able to measure is the procedural success rate and we\u2019re actually able to be at all these early procedures our self and so we feel just great that the training is very effective. You\u2019ll remember us talking in the past about the fact we actually incent our sales force on procedural success rate, so it\u2019s really paying off. All that investment that we put up front to make sure that we have great training and a great team that was well trained was great. And so rather than trying and quoting exact numbers, David, I\u2019ll just say that it\u2019s going as well if not better than any of our prior experience.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then, lastly for Tom, on the tax rate. I was a little bit surprised given the US starting to comprise a larger and larger percentage of revenue, the tax rate actually would be going up. Can you maybe just talk about the dynamics that are driving the tax rate in fact lower and then how we should think about that on a sustainable basis particularly assuming that the US over time is going to become a larger and larger piece of your business?","Thomas Abate","Yeah, you\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s somewhat counterintuitive, but we try to be clear here, David, that the rate is actually higher than last year. All right? And the projection is that it\u2019s going to be a couple hundred, 250 basis points probably higher than last year. So it\u2019s clearly being impacted by the US profitability it just wasn\u2019t has high. Our model was probably conservative a little bit on where the sourcing was happening.","So keep in mind that when I have to make an adjustment in midyear what we\u2019re doing is the adjustment looks bigger than it actually is because it has to be a retroactive effect. So I\u2019m adjusting two quarters within one. So you pretty much cut the difference in half and it\u2019s not that big of a difference and I would attribute it to the model, difference in the model that I was using.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Thomas Abate","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gunderson from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Gunderson \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Hi. Good afternoon. Say, Mike, last quarter on European TAVI growth for the year you were expecting 20% to 25% now it\u2019s 15% to 20%. Other than the Netherlands and the euro is there anything else contributing to the slight adjustment there?","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, Tom. Good question. Yeah, really the euro wasn\u2019t in there. When we try and get those growth rates we try and do what on constant currency so we really do \u2013 we did change what we bought. We thought Europe was growing 20% to 25% or we thought that would be the growth rate for 2012 and now we think 15% to 20%. We think there\u2019s two pieces of that, that are somewhat similar. One is this sharp drop in the Netherlands. And part of it was the drop in the Netherlands and also that we thought it was going to rise. We thought that you actually might see an extra 100 procedures per quarter that happened in the Netherlands and that\u2019s obviously not going to happen. Instead, we saw the decline.","But the other part of this \u2013 we probably saw a little further softening in Southern Europe. A little more. We thought it would probably, it would have bottomed, but there still looks like there is a bit more further softening, Tom.","Tom Gunderson \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thanks. And then, Tom, on guidance for Q3 the revenues are almost the same with a little slack there as Q2 but earnings a little bit lower. Other than just the revenue delta can you break out what contributes to the difference between similar revenues with different earnings sequentially?","Thomas Abate","Yeah. I\u2019d say I don\u2019t see \u2013 you know, in our models and looking back to check in the revenue I have a bit less revenue on the one hand than you may have. I think they see the rates looking pretty similar. What typically happens is the SG&A is a percentage in that quarter because of the lower sales, but you\u2019re saying you\u2019re not getting that. But obviously in a higher SG&A percentage and the rest is pretty even.","Tom Gunderson \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Tax rate. And is SG&A a little higher in total dollars sequentially?","Thomas Abate","Percentage we usually refer to. And tax rate, tax rate a little bit higher. Remember, Thomas, that I had took a full half year of quarter adjustment in the quarter so we\u2019re trying to get to a full year rate. So if you look at the first half rate, it\u2019ll give a better estimate of what we\u2019re running at in the third quarter.","Tom Gunderson \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Thomas Abate","Okay.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies & Co. Please proceed with you question.","Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies & Co","Oh hi, good afternoon, guys.","Michael Mussallem","Hi, Raj.","Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies & Co","What if I could ask about some of the information that\u2019s come out over the several months on perivalvular leakage and some of the data out of Europe suggesting that balloon expandable valves might have a lower rate of leakage than self expanding. I\u2019m curious what your thoughts are around that and whether you think ultimately, that could prove to be a competitive advantage for you, particularly in Europe.","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, you know the fact that there was a correlation between perivalvular leak, I think we all found interesting and we, being a surgical valve company, we\u2019ve always been focused on trying to get zero leaks with transcatheter heart valves. There probably the most fortunate thing for us is the approach that we had all previously taken on SAPIEN 3, which was really designed to have a dramatic improvement on perivalvular leak. We still know that it correlates. We don\u2019t know that it\u2019s causal and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s good data that\u2019s out there, Raj, that really gives you detailed information on self expanding valves versus balloon expandable. We like to think so, but we don\u2019t have the comparable data on the self expanding to be able to make that comparison cleanly.","Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies & Co","So I guess, net, you don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be much impact in terms of market shares in Europe, for instance?","Michael Mussallem","Well, I think ultimately there\u2019ll be data that\u2019ll be out there. There\u2019s much more 3D imaging that\u2019s going on. I think there\u2019s much better sizing going on than ever before, and much more use of CT scan. So I think ultimately the story will be told, but I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything that\u2019s really playing out in the present that\u2019s going to be that stark in comparison.","Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies & Co","Okay, and then if I could ask about physician reimbursement here in the United States. I guess the CBT code is still being worked on for next year. Do you have any current thoughts around what that updated code could mean for you? And also really how physician reimbursement is being worked right now in the United States. How are you seeing centers deal with splitting various reimbursements among various clinicians right now?","Michael Mussallem","Yeah, I\u2019ll give you my best estimate, Raj. And again, we need to give other people a chance. Right now what\u2019s going on is highly variable, depending on the center. Many centers sort of work in teams. They take the income and they split it up amongst the clinicians. I can\u2019t tell you that every center is doing that. We believe that the direction the CBT codes are going in is that they should be fair. There\u2019s a process that goes on and we think that recommendation which we understand as a pretty fair one has gone to CMS.","They often adopt those recommendations. Not every time, but they often and generally do. So if it goes the way that it\u2019s been teed up, we think it should be a fair reimbursement. And we think that would be welcome.There is variability out there in terms of how some of the regions are paying on CBT codes. There are some that fully pay and others that we even know one or two places where they actually don\u2019t pay and they\u2019re in arrears and they have to catch up at some point in time. So it\u2019s still messy in that regard.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good afternoon.","Michael Mussallem","Hi, David.","Thomas Abate","Hi, David.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey, Mike, I had a strategic question for you. As Edwards sort of transitions from more of the clinical milestones where you\u2019ve been successful into more execution, I wonder if you could sort of help us understand how you\u2019re thinking about the top line growth versus leverage. And specifically it\u2019s hard to argue with the gross margins in the quarter. And obviously with better mix those margins probably trend higher. But R&D was obviously the highest we\u2019ve seen in the company. And I wonder if you can just sort of talk about when do you think that leverage inflection occurs in the business. And based on the R&D programs you\u2019d be sort of comfortable at this point saying that something around 15% probably does represent a peak for R&D spending at the company.","Michael Mussallem","Thanks, David. I think I know where you\u2019re going, but let\u2019s talk about it strategically. We\u2019re not sure there\u2019s any substitute for driving great sales growth. Although we, like you, want to see real leverage come through the P&L, we wouldn\u2019t want to do that at the expense of sales growth. And so we always try and strike that balance where we think we can have really bright innovations that change the way medicines practice so we can get rewarded for it. We obviously opt for that. What \u2013 your point specifically, when are you going to see leverage, we think you\u2019re already seeing some of that leverage. And I think that starts continuing. We\u2019ve made a large investment in launching in the US. And although we\u2019ll make continuous investments in the US, particularly on the SG&A line, the sales are going to grow faster than the SG&A expenses, which is the largest proportion of our expense base. It should\u2019ve caused our operating margin to rise.","As you correctly see here with this quarter here is that the R&D rate has risen. And I think this is just the byproduct of what it takes to really make future sales a reality. It requires clinical studies and that\u2019s not cheap. In terms of the high watermark, I actually think that this rate that we gave for full year to be between 15% and 16%, I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s going to continue next year or not. It may be the high watermark. I hope so. With the way we expect to grow sales it should be that. But we\u2019re not going to hesitate to make the clinical investments that we need to, David, to drive the top line.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great sir, very clear, just the second really quick question. We talked a lot about European pressure but you talked about a little bit of critical care pressure in the US in the release but not so much on the call. Was there any second quarter capital pressure in your critical business and could we see that potentially rebound in the back half of the year if, when a lot of companies have reported in the second quarter was really more of a delayed capital purchasing. I wonder if you think that will come back in the back half.","Michael Mussallem","Yeah. We did see our growth rate in capital decline in Critical Care. It\u2019s not as though the environment really dried up; part of it is the prior-year comparison. We had just launched EV1000 and we were in the middle of that and so we did quite well in Q2 2011. So some of that was the decline, it\u2019s just a tough comparison, David. I like to think that the climate is good enough for us to be able to do better in terms of growth rate on hardware going forward, especially with our new EV1000. Again, we\u2019re not exactly the same as some of the big box guys because our hardware is not nearly as expensive as a robot or an MRI, but we still get affected by some of the similar trends.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you very much.","Michael Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America","Hi. Thanks. Can you hear me okay?","Michael Mussallem","Sure, Bob.","Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America","Great. Good afternoon. Just two quick questions, one a little bit in the weeds and then one a little bit bigger picture. Last quarter as it related to your US TAVI sales you were kind enough to break down the $41 million and I think you said in terms of commercial revenues it was roughly $24 million and stocking revenues $10 million and then trial revenue about $7 million and I was wondering if you\u2019d be willing to do the same thing here for Q2.","Michael Mussallem","Okay. Well, let\u2019s see. We said overall \u2013 you\u2019re talking about US in particular?","Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America","Yeah. So again, the US breakdown of that $61.4 million.","Michael Mussallem","We said $61 million in the quarter. Commercial was $53 million. So that pretty much, that gets you to what the clinical was; that\u2019s $8 million. And then we said of the $53 million, 25% were net stocking units. And net stocking units get pretty easy this quarter because consignment was pretty much negligible. Okay? One, it was about a million dollars. Okay? So you can pretty much get yourself there, huh?","Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America","Yep. And then you trained 50 centers. Is that roughly the pace we should expect for Q3, Q4?","Michael Mussallem","I think so. The one thing that changes there is the fact that when we get the approval for Cohort A we\u2019re going to need to train all the existing centers again and that\u2019s going to be a formal training. We\u2019ll actually bring people into our training center. It won\u2019t take two days like it does today. It\u2019s more like a one-day training, but it will consume some of that training capacity. So that\u2019s the one thing we wanted to alert you to.","Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America","Great. And then lastly on gross margins, just a little bit bigger picture, cause right now currency and product mix, but as we think longer term about gross margin, now that you\u2019re kind of into the US launch and obviously annualizing at a really nice rate right now. In your view would it be a mistake to suggest that Edwards thinking out longer term? And I\u2019m not talking about 2013, I\u2019m just thinking about longer term, that this can\u2019t be a 78% to 80% gross margin company?","Michael Mussallem","I hesitate to get out in front of ourselves. The Valve business by itself is profitable, and it does have a chance to certainly lift our gross margins, but I think it\u2019s premature to talk about those numbers at this point.","Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. And then on the Analyst Day, are you going to be giving longer-term? How long-term guidance are you going to be providing?","Michael Mussallem","That\u2019s a good question. What do you think we should do?","Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America","The next five years.","Michael Mussallem","Okay. Thanks for your input, Bob.","Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America","Thanks, guys.","Michael Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","We have time for one last question. Our last question comes from the line of Spencer Nam from ThinkEquity. Please proceed with your question.","Spencer Nam \u2013 ThinkEquity","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just have one question. There were a lot of discussions at the beginning of the year based on some data points that myself and peers, my peer analysts have gathered suggesting that the adoption, particularly just with Cohort B, maybe a lot slower than you guys had outlined. But it seems like you are actually blowing numbers away, at least the first couple of quarters.","And also just based on the way you guys are guiding, you guys also are adjusting some of those numbers yourselves, or the parameters yourselves. We\u2019re just curious what things that you are learning as you launch the product, what are some of the things that you are learning that you had not seen prior to this year? And then what are some of the things that we should be thinking about as we try to model this more properly?","Michael Mussallem","Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. The one big question that was out there, Spencer, that\u2019s always hard to understand is how many patients are on the sideline that were not being treated? And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve really learned. We had some experience in Europe, but we didn\u2019t \u2013 when we started Europe we didn\u2019t have this kind of experience. We didn\u2019t have a randomized trial under our belt. We didn\u2019t have this full reimbursement that was pretty well defined.","So to have all those pieces in place, what we\u2019re seeing here are these untreated patients are coming in. They\u2019re coming in a big way and because procedure results are so good, they\u2019re getting pretty dramatic results, which gets physicians excited. And so it\u2019s driving real enthusiasm, which I think does help with the referral network. So what we\u2019re \u2013 what we\u2019ve basically saw is probably patients that either were just too sick or wouldn\u2019t even think about surgery in the past are coming and getting treated. And that\u2019s probably the biggest learning.","Spencer Nam \u2013 ThinkEquity","Thank you.","Michael Mussallem","All right. Thanks very much, all, for your continued interest in Edwards.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. David Erickson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Erickson. You may now begin.","David K. Erickson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our fourth quarter 2015 financial results. During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules, and then use remaining time for Q&A.

Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, David. We're very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to another successful year both in financial performance and progress on important new therapies. We exited the year with total global sales of $2.5 billion, representing an underlying growth rate of 17%, which is higher than we predicted a year ago. And just recently, we were pleased to receive FDA approval of our PARTNER 3 Trial to study patients determined to be at low surgical risk, which may eventually enable heart teams to offer choice of therapies to a broader group of patients.","For the quarter, total underlying sales grew to $267 million, an increase of 15%. Results were driven by robust demand for TAVR therapy and the strong performance of all product lines this quarter.","In Transcatheter Heart Valves, full-year global sales were $1.2 billion, up 38% over the prior year on an underlying basis. We exceeded our original estimate of 15% to 25% provided a year ago, primarily due to the early approval of SAPIEN 3 in the U.S. and the more rapid than expected therapy adoption in Europe.","For the fourth quarter, underlying global sales were up 32% over last year, led by the impact of SAPIEN 3 in the U.S. and double-digit underlying sales growth across all regions. Globally, average selling prices remain stable.","In the U.S., underlying THV sales for the quarter grew 50% versus the prior year to $189 million. Our performance was driven by procedure growth, which was unexpectedly strong during the holiday season, and has not been our typical experience. We estimate that Edwards' growth was similar to the overall procedure growth. Nearly, all of our existing accounts are now using our SAPIEN 3 valve. Growth was primarily driven by large hospitals and new site training continued during the fourth quarter, finishing the year with approximately 400 active centers.","Our recently introduced 20 millimeter SAPIEN 3 valve was also a contributor. We believe the strong growth and adoption of TAVR in the U.S. was driven by the growing body of clinical evidence, increased physician experience, and high procedural success. Many hospitals are responding to the increased demand by modifying their schedules to perform more procedures each week. We see this trend continuing as TAVR provides an attractive therapy option for a large number of untreated elderly patients. We expect these patients will be encouraged to seek treatment as indications expand, which is the primary driver behind our belief that the global TAVR opportunity will exceed $5 billion in 2021.","Outside the U.S., underlying THV sales grew double-digits in all regions aided by the continued rollout of SAPIEN XT in Japan. We estimate our OUS growth was roughly in line with overall therapy adoption.","In Europe, we estimate that therapy adoption grew more than 20% and our sales growth was somewhat lower. Our sales growth was primarily lifted by the continued adoption of SAPIEN 3. We estimate that more recent competitors continue to account for approximately 15% of total procedures. We saw strong growth across most countries and total procedures are becoming more dispersed throughout the region, with other countries growing faster than Germany for the past couple of quarters. Generally, reimbursement trends remain stable allowing for continued growth and adoption. In 2016, expanding the indication to treat intermediate risk patients remains a key focus. We expect data from the intermediate risk cohorts in two studies to be presented at the American College of Cardiology Meeting in April, a randomized study of SAPIEN XT versus surgery and a study of SAPIEN 3.","As we indicated at our Investor Conference, assuming positive results and an expedited FDA review, we're planning for a late 2016 U.S. approval and a minimal contribution to sales this year. We expect our Continued Access Program for intermediate risk patients in the U.S. to continue until commercial approval. We plan to use the U.S data in a CE Mark submission in Europe. And as I mentioned earlier, we received FDA approval to study an expanded indication for the SAPIEN 3 valve. The IDE study will enroll elderly patients at least 65 years of age with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who've been determined by a heart team to be at low risk for mortality if they were to undergo surgical aortic valve replacement.","The PARTNER 3 Trial will enroll approximately 1,300 patients at up to 50 sites and we're working now to secure IRB and contract approvals at those hospitals. Enrollment is expected to continue into 2017, and while we believe this procedure will be attractive to low risk patients, randomized trials typically take longer to enroll. The SAPIEN 3 trial will also include a 400 patient sub study using advanced imaging to evaluate leaflet motion in surgical and transcatheter tissue valves.","We're looking forward to introducing our SAPIEN 3 Ultra System, which is on track for CE Mark in the fourth quarter of this year. This new system, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, is expected to enhance ease of use, further reduce possible complications, and shorten procedure time.","We also remain on track with our efforts to add the Pulmonic indication to our SAPIEN family of valves. During the first quarter, we expect to receive approval and launch SAPIEN XT for this indication and then begin enrolling patients in a clinical trial for the SAPIEN 3 in Q2.","In summary, based on our momentum, and the expectation of continued therapy adoption, we are increasing our 2016 THV global sales estimate by $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We now expect our underlying sales growth in 2016 to be in the range of 15% to 25%.","Turning to the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group, full-year 2015 global sales were $785 million, up 2.5% on an underlying basis over the prior year and consistent with our original guidance of 1% to 3%. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $196 million, up slightly over last year on an underlying basis. Globally, sales growth was lifted by higher surgical heart valve units, but was lowered by the planned exit of non-strategic products.","Sales of our premium products contributed to solid heart valve performance across all major regions led by procedural volume and share gains. Surgical Heart Valve units grew approximately 5% and global average selling pricing declined slightly due to country mix. During the fourth quarter, we submitted the PMA in support of the FDA approval of our rapid deployment INTUITY Elite valve. We still expect to launch in the U.S. mid-2016.","In Germany, adopters (10:16) of our INTUITY Elite valve will now benefit from a new higher DRG for combined procedures. We believe this will support greater adoption of our rapid deployment valve for patients who suffer from the combination of aortic stenosis and coronary disease, a common occurrence.","Notably, a recent paper published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery concluded that our PERIMOUNT Magna Ease family of valves demonstrated excellent long-term durability and hydrodynamic performance after accelerated in vitro testing equivalent to 25 years of heart beats. All valve studies successfully endured 1 billion cycles, which is five times longer than the standard testing requirement for a tissue valve.","In summary, we're pleased with the continued strength of our premium surgical valve products and are preparing for new product launches in 2016. We continue to focus on improving therapy options for younger patients, streamlining complex surgeries, and enabling minimally invasive procedures. We are reiterating our 2016 underlying sales growth expectation for the total product group of 3% to 6%.","In the Critical Care product group, total sales for the quarter were $141 million and grew 4% on an underlying basis. Total sales for 2015 were $528 million, up 3% over the prior year on an underlying basis consistent with our original guidance of 2% to 4%.","Global growth for the quarter was driven primarily by core hemodynamic monitoring products in the U.S. and our Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, which recorded double-digits underlying growth across most regions. We are focused on strengthening our core offerings by strengthening our gold standard products including a next-generation monitor. We are expanding our sales force in the U.S. to broaden the adoption of our market-leading products. And, in Japan, we're expecting a contribution to growth from the launch of ClearSight, our non-invasive monitoring technology.","Overall, we're pleased with the continuing adoption of Enhanced Surgical Recovery and the strengthening of our core products. We continue to expect Critical Care underlying sales growth of 2% to 4% in 2016.","As we highlighted at our Investor Conference, we're investing in a number of structural heart initiatives. We continue to make progress on our CardiAQ-Edwards, transcatheter mitral valve program, or TMVR, and our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation.","Early U.S. feasibility studies with both of these technologies are currently underway. Additionally, we're continuing to closely follow our investments in the Harpoon chordal repair and the CardioKinetix heart failure therapies as they gain clinical experience. While all of these technologies are substantial opportunities, they do involve significant challenges and are in their early stages.","Providing some more detail on our TMVR program, we've begun treating patients in our U.S. early feasibility study planned for seven sites. Our learnings from these cases will inform our CE Mark trial, which is expected to begin in mid-2016.","Our mitral team is currently working on enhancements to the CardiAQ-Edwards valve platform, including additional sizes, delivery system refinements, and the addition of Edwards' clinically proven bovine pericardial tissue. We're also currently developing additional next-generation TMVR products that leverage our experience.","We're optimistic about the future of TMVR technology. And although commercialization timelines are still unclear, we continue to believe that TMVR will ultimately benefit patients with mitral valve disease who aren't well-served today. And, finally, in regards to the recently implemented two year suspension of the U.S. medical device excise tax, we're evaluating a number of meaningful opportunities to accelerate existing growth programs or initiate new ones. And, as such, we expect a minimal positive impact to 2016 earnings.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott B. Ullem - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Mike. I'm pleased to report that with our strong finish to the year, we achieved our 2015 key financial targets. For the full-year, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.29. Sales increased nearly 17% on an underlying basis to $2.5 billion. Our gross profit margin was 75.2% and free cash flow was $447 million.","In the fourth quarter, another strong sales performance in transcatheter valves drove our top line to an overall 15% underlying sales growth rate, unusually strong U.S. THV sales during the holiday season lifted performance above our expectations. The strong U.S. dollar continued to have a significant negative impact on reported sales, which grew 9%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.63, representing 19% growth over the prior-year. Total underlying sales in the fourth quarter were $667 million. This excludes the $4 million benefit of the THV sales return reserve, as we substantially completed the SAPIEN 3 product exchange in the United States.","I'll now cover the details behind our results and then share guidance for 2016. For the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 73.8%, compared to 74.0% in the same period of 2014. We expected fourth quarter gross profit to be approximately 75%, based on a more profitable product mix and a positive impact from foreign exchange hedge contracts. Our actual result was below our expectation, because we elected to realign some critical care manufacturing operations to improve our cost structure. We continue to expect our gross profit margin, excluding special items, to be between 74% and 75% in 2016.","Turning to SG&A, fourth quarter expenses were $222 million or 33.1% of sales, compared to $223 million in the prior year. The modest decrease was driven by the favorable foreign exchange impact on our expenses outside the United States, largely offsetting higher sales and marketing expenses related to transcatheter valves. Given our increased THV sales estimate, we now expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year 2016, which is an improvement over our Investor Conference guidance.","Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 17% to $98 million or 14.6% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral valve and aortic valve programs, including spending on clinical trials. For the full-year 2016, we continue to expect research and development as a percentage of sales to be approximately 16%. We are evaluating the opportunities to reinvest the savings from the two-year suspension of the U.S. medical device excise tax. We're deploying a disciplined process to explore value-creating opportunities to accelerate existing programs or initiate new ones.","Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 16%, which benefited from the renewal of the federal research and development tax credit. Given the expected stronger sales of THV in the U.S., we now expect our full year 2016 tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. And in light of recent legislation making the R&D tax credit permanent, we expect our rate to be relatively consistent across quarters.","Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted fourth quarter sales by $35 million compared to the prior year, driven by the weakening of the euro and yen. Compared to our October guidance, foreign exchange rates positively impacted earnings per share by $0.01. At current rates, we continue to estimate a $55 million negative impact to full year 2016 sales.","Cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter was $104 million and included a $33 million tax payment related to a previously reported litigation settlement. After capital spending of $37.5 million, free cash flow was $66.3 million.","Turning to our balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.2 billion. Total debt was $600 million. During the full year 2015, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million split-adjusted shares for $280 million.","Now, turning to our 2016 guidance, all of which assumes current foreign exchange rates. For Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, due to our strong momentum and expectation of continued therapy adoption, we are raising our 2016 guidance provided at our December Investor Conference to be between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We continue to expect sales for Surgical Heart Valve Therapy of $780 million to $820 million, for Critical Care of $510 million to $550 million, and now expect total sales of $2.6 billion to $2.85 billion.","Primarily as the result of increased expectations for sales, we are raising adjusted earnings per share guidance to be between $2.57 and $2.67, free cash flow to $475 million to $525 million. The suspension of the medical device tax is expected to have minimal impact on 2016 earnings per share. We continue to expect shares outstanding in the range of 216 million to 220 million, which reflects our plan to repurchase shares during 2016.","As we explained at our Investor Conference, adjusted earnings per share now excludes intangible amortization expense and prior period comparisons are available on our website. For the first quarter 2016, at current FX rates, we project total sales to be between $640 million and $680 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.70.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Scott. In conclusion, we're pleased to achieve healthy financial performance and substantial progress on important new therapies in 2015. Our focused innovation strategy can transform patient care and drive value to the healthcare system and to shareholders. We're enthusiastic about the continued expansion of transcatheter based therapies for the many structural heart patients still in need, which positions us for a bright future.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to David.","David K. Erickson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Mike. At the upcoming American College of Cardiology Conference in April, we are planning to host an Investor Meeting to discuss the latest presentations. Additional details will be provided once the late breaker schedule becomes available. In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and we'll answer as many as we can during the remainder of the hour.","Operator, we're ready for questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from David Roman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you and good afternoon, everybody. I want to just start with your disclosure around the transcatheter valve centers and specifically the 400 number that you referenced. I think, at the time of the NCD when that was originally issued, there were some concerns that that specifications and qualifications that actually limit that number to being somewhat lower. Can you maybe just sort of talk about what you're seeing in the landscape? Are centers doing things to make themselves more TAVR already? Are you seeing an expansion of the addressable market relative to your initial expectations?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks, David. You're right. When we originally talked about this, I think we estimated that this might take us to the 350 to 400 range and here we are right at about 400 active centers today. And there are more centers that are interested in getting within the NCD qualification. So, they are doing the things that they need to do to have the staff and capabilities in place, so that they can be added. And that's an encouraging sight (23:58) from our perspective. So, we're continuing to add. Having said that, David, most of the growth that we're seeing is really coming from large centers, and that continues to be a big driver of what's going on right now.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And maybe just a follow-up on that. Can you maybe help us just piece together the following moving parts. I think in your commentary, you had said that some of the upside in the quarter came from unexpected strength at the end of the year, but you're raising your 2016 guidance for transcatheter valves and maintaining the over $5 billion by 2021. Can you maybe just help us understand why we're not sort of pulling forward from future patients here, and what gives you the confidence at this point of the year to raise the expectations?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, David. Yeah, typically we see a real slowdown in the last two weeks of December, just the way the holidays fall, it's not common for people to have the kind of procedures that Edwards is involved in during that time. We just didn't see that slowdown this year, so that surprised us to see the strength of those procedures.","Now when you couple it with the fact that we're now in the beginning of February, we've had a chance to see our January numbers, and it appears that this wasn't stealing procedures from January, but rather we continued at a strong pace. And so, that's really more of a commentary about the strength of the therapy adoption. And so, given the strength of that momentum and what we see, that really what encouraged us to raise our estimates for full-year 2016.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question...","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David.","Operator","The next question is from Brooks West of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Can you hear me?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Hear you, Brooks.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thanks, Mike, and congratulations on a great end of the year. I had, I guess, a two-part question just around expectations for data and ultimate FDA reaction coming out of ACC. I wonder if you could just walk us through again the logic path of walking the label to SAPIEN 3, obviously, that's the commercial bet you're making but you're going to be mixing data from both the XT valve and also the SAPIEN 3 valve. That's question number one. Question number two is, as we've been talking to physicians, there's an expectation for non-inferiority versus surgery but some hope that maybe you're able to show superiority, I wonder if you would just comment on that thought in general.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Brooks. Yeah. Let me try and take it apart. There are going to be two datasets that are substantial that are presented at the ACC. The original PARTNER II Trial is a randomization of SAPIEN XT versus open heart valve replacement. You'll see the results of that, that's a substantial study and again high quality science. Within the contemporary timeframe, we were able to introduce SAPIEN 3 and so, literally added to the PARTNER II was this separate arm of 1,000 SAPIEN 3 patients that were also enrolled in intermediate patients. And the thought here is, it's a comparison of SAPIEN 3 that you'll be able to compare to both the SAPIEN XT data and also the surgical data, because it was all done in a contemporary timeframe. And since the SAPIEN 3 valve is the valve that's broadly in use today, I think the logic will hold together and we're expecting that physicians and FDA will see it that way. So, that sort of point number one.","Point number two, the way the trial was constructed, it was a non-inferiority trial, and we really powered it for non-inferiority. But it's still a very large trial to power a trial for superiority. We will assume that the time would have taken a lot of patients. So, we're still assuming that we are favorable on non-inferiority. It's always possible that somebody can do a post-hoc analysis of the data and try and analyze whether it's superior, but it will be trying to do it with a number of patients that was really intended to demonstrate non-inferiority.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Perfect. Thanks, Mike. Appreciate the color.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go head.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, and I also reiterate my congratulations on a strong quarter. So, I guess what stands out to me is that you raise sales by about $100 million \u2013 sales guidance for 2016 by $100 million, but you raised EPS by about $0.27. It suggests about an 80% to 90% operating margin and the incremental $100 million in sales which sounds high \u2013 it just sounds like you're letting more of the upside fall to the bottom line than you have in past. So, first, is that fair, and it sounds like \u2013 and if so, why? And, second, you're guiding to 30% to 32%, I think, SG&A in 2016, I think at the Analyst Meeting, your long-term SG&A guidance was low-30%. So, how should we think about SG&A going forward? And I did have a follow up. Thanks.","Scott B. Ullem - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Larry, it's Scott. Good question, the answer to your first question is, yes, most of that incremental sales generated from THV will fall through to the bottom line earnings per share. We're also battling a little bit higher tax rate because of some of those incremental sales will be coming out of the U.S. In terms of SG&A as a percentage of sales, I think our guidance for longer term is unchanged, it's still going to be in that low-30% of sales range, longer term.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And, I guess, I'm just curious, Mike, if you receive approval for intermediate risk later this year, do you think SAPIEN 3 will disproportionately benefit until your competitor also receives that indication? Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks. We feel like we're the market share leader today. And because of the way the National Coverage Determination is written, the coverage is really linked to an FDA approval and it's product-specific. So, clinicians that were to use a valve that wasn't approved for intermediate risk, would run the risk of running afoul of the NCD. So, we think physicians will be somewhat disciplined. And so, I think we do end up with some kind of an advantage if we were to have an intermediate risk approval before our competitor.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. So, let me just follow up on Larry's kind of question about the guidance, and obviously everybody is looking at the fourth quarter and saying fantastic performance and loves to see the numbers moving higher. But the drop-through is obviously much more dramatic than what we've seen in the past. In fact, Scott, if you do the back envelope numbers and just took the midpoint of the prior sales range, the midpoint of the prior SG&A guidance and the midpoint of the new sales range, the new SG&A guidance, it actually implies with the incremental $100 million in sales that SG&A is actually down slightly despite the incremental sales numbers. So, is there something else you guys are doing just in terms of your planning for 2016, or was it just, hey, that that we went into it initially being conservative on what we thought we'd spend and it's just going to come in lower than what we're initially planning?","Scott B. Ullem - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. It's a good question, Mike. I think we give ranges because there are a lot of moving pieces really the sales estimate does fall through to the bottom line. And it's just it's a lot of positive momentum going into earnings per share growth. But, there is really nothing else to speak of that's changed in the overall model.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And let me just ask, Mike. So, if you think about the incremental opportunity from here, because we're obviously only partway through the play out of the TAVR market. And we're talking about a $5 billion plus market as we go out. If we think about the earnings drop-through from here from your incremental TAVR sales, not talking 2016, but really over the next three years to four years, how do you want us to think about that incremental drop-through given what you're saying today about 2016?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks for that Mike. As you can imagine, there is a limited number of TAVR centers, and given the fact that this expansion is probably likely to occur within their existing centers, we are going to get a fair amount of leverage, and there will be a lot of drop-through. Now having said that, we are aggressive investors in our future, and as you know we have a number of initiatives going in the area of structural heart. Those investments, we think, are great investments and they have an opportunity to yield a lot of future success, but they don't have any sales associated with them, so those aren't particularly accretive to earnings. And so, I would encourage you to be moderate in terms of what you would expect all that drop-through to be as we go forward.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jason Mills of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, for taking the question. Congrats on the good quarter. I wanted to go back to David's question on number of centers. I was also surprised with the expansion in the number of centers in United States. And I'm wondering if you could, just looking at the landscape, and you're \u2013 to your funnel, what you expect sort of from a long-term perspective in the United States, specifically in terms of the number of TAVI centers there might be, with the puts and takes of the regulations, et cetera? And I'm also wondering if, based on your commentary, that you didn't see the slowdown during the Christmas months or the holidays that you normally see in other businesses. If you're not seeing dramatic improvements in length of stay, so patients are getting out of the hospital in one day or two days so they're not spending that time in the hospital during the holiday. So, I'm wondering if that's have an impact also on the number of centers that could be TAVI centers over the longer term?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good question, Jason. And it's fair to say that we're learning as we go. These are tough to anticipate in advance just exactly how many centers are going to be into it. And what we find here is with the success of TAVR, and actually it appears to be a really learnable procedure, that centers are sincerely interested in having this option to offer to their patient. Just think if you're a center that only offers a surgical option, you're not quite as attractive as you might be if you had a full range of options. So, this is encouraging centers to come into it. In terms of how many, we do have somewhat of a backlog. It would be a real guess at this point, but maybe an additional 40 sites in 2016 might be added. We know some of these sites, if we're successful in getting a Pulmonic indication might be pediatric sites that come in and learn TAVR as well. So it's an estimate, Jason, but hopefully that helps you a little bit.","In terms of what's going on over the holiday season, I suspect you're right, the shorter length of stays probably encouraged people to maybe take something on over the holidays that they might not have taken on if it had a long recovery period. We didn't anticipate it, so I can't tell you that we had this all figured out in advance. This is more we watched the story and now we're applying our own explanations to why, but we probably have to dig a little deeper to understand it. But, again, I'll just remind you on the bigger picture in terms of number of centers. We continue to see the large bulk of the growth come from these big hospitals that already have strong programs.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","That's helpful commentary, Mike. Thanks. My follow-up is, in relation to the $100 million incremental guidance on the THV side, I understand that you have refrained from giving us thoughts on growth U.S. versus outside the U.S. but could you frame the incremental guidance increase in terms of where you expect the bulk of that to come and whether or not perhaps if it is the U.S. that's really what's driving the incremental operating margin that folks have been asking about on the call?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think, it's fair to say, Jason, that we believe the majority of that $100 million increase is going to come from the U.S.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Rick Wise of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, everybody. Mike, one question for you, and then one for Scott. To you, just can you talk about the Pulmonic trial starting in the second quarter \u2013 first quarter and second quarter with XT and then S3. Can you frame the opportunity for us at all? Docs are telling us that having one device with multiple indications is helpful. Has the lack of an indication been a hindrance and now you have a bigger opportunity? And then I have a follow-up for Scott.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Yeah, the Pulmonic indication is still by comparison a smaller opportunity, although it's really important for these patients in need. These are often children. We estimate that the opportunity in terms of overall size is in the, maybe the, $50 million to $100 million range, if that helps for your estimate.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And, Scott, just quickly on gross margin, you reviewed it very clearly, you expected 75%, you got what you got because of the Critical Care reorganization. Was the entirety of the variance related to that? And just as I think about the margin guidance for 2016, maybe you'd review some of the puts and takes. Hedging is a negative, but volume is better, I would think that would be an offset. Thanks.","Scott B. Ullem - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Sure. The \u2013 so I'll tell you some of the other inputs to the 73.8% margin in fourth quarter. About 1.2% of that was from better mix, but it was more than offset by investments that we continue to make in our operations part of which was that 1% of gross margin that we invested in realigning some Critical Care operations. In terms of margins going forward, I guess for 2016, we're still in that 74% to 75% range. Again it's a range. Yes, we probably moved up higher in that range as a result of the higher THV sales, but that's still the right range to model. I think longer-term, the margin profile is probably going to be similar. There was an earlier question about, is SG&A as a percentage of sales low-30% still the right number? Yes it is. We're going to continue to invest in the business, as Mike said, so 16% R&D is still the right level to be thinking about longer-term.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Just two quick questions. Mike, just first for you, thinking about the low risk trial and the criteria for that trial for patients to be included over 65, what impact do you think that has on trial enrollment or eventual low risk commercialization, if any? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David. Maybe, what I'll refer you back, those that recall, Larry Wood used a graph that sort of was a bell-shaped curve that showed the patients with AS that we believe exist by age. And if you were to look at that, the bulk of the patients we believe are over 65. So actually capping or having an age cutoff at 65, we don't think is a major deterrent to enrollment. We think there's plenty of patients over 65 that have low surgical risk that'll make that a popular trial. So if that gets at your question.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then no impact, Mike, I would imagine on eventual commercialization in terms of the low risk population you identified relative to that criteria?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we still think it's attractive. And again, I'll refer you back to that graph. The patients that are under 65 with severe symptomatic AS, there's actually a pretty high percentage of those patients that are already treated today because they're great surgical candidates. It's those older patients that are deemed probably not great surgical candidates or the ones that are left on the sidelines that now it becomes an attractive opportunity for them to have this opportunity at a higher quality life.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ben Andrew of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, Mike, and thank you for taking the question. Two things from me. First, talk a little bit about the European dynamic and the competitive situation with pricing et cetera. You talked about maybe 15% of volume as well as Germany being perhaps slower, but maybe just some more color there.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Ben. So, yeah, Europe again was a strong performer. We think that market growth was probably in excess of 20%. That was pretty impressive, especially when you consider it's been now like eight years since we introduced in Europe.","We grew a little slower than that. I want to say we're in the high-teens range. So, we probably gave up a little bit of market share in Europe that was not unexpected on our part. But the good news here is, I think in 2015 the overall growth for Edwards in Europe was something in the 25% range. So, there has been so much therapy adoption that we've been able to have strong growth here, even in the face of this increased competition, which we had signaled right along.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","And do you think, Mike, as a follow up, that with the new indications and as we go into later 2016 and to 2017, that you can actually start to retake share as you expand the market, whereas others maybe won't have that opportunity?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're fortunate that we have a very strong share position already. And as we probably indicate, we sell at a price premium and so we're going to continue to exhibit pricing discipline on our part and we like to think that the strength of our products will continue to differentiate us. As I mentioned there, you got a number of new competitors and they seem to be around 15% of the overall procedures today. So, that gives you some kind of a picture of how things look today, and we feel pretty confident about the future.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Raj Denhoy of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. First of all, great quarter. But I wonder if I could ask a bit about the timing of the mitral CE Mark trial. You're still talking about mid-2016, but if you \u2013 is there anything more you can provide about what that trial will look like, types of patients, how long of a follow up you'll have?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Raj. Yeah, our intention, we signal this to \u2013 is to begin mid-year. As we indicated, we began our early feasibility studies in the U.S. right now. And we expect to learn a lot from those studies. And we're going to try and take advantage of that learning as we go through and design our CE Mark trial. So, that design is not fixed at this point, so I don't have anything to share. But, again, as long as we \u2013 if we can have a good success with our EFS experience then we'd like to think that we stay on track and are able to get that. And we'll let you know what the trial looks like, and it'll certainly be posted on clintrials.gov (sic) [clinicaltrials.gov] (44:42).","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just one on the PARTNER 3 Trial as well. The FDA is asking you to have this mobility, this leaflet mobility study. Is there anything more you can provide about what they're looking for in that other than just looking at leaflet mobility? Is there a clinical component to that as well that they might be considering over time?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I probably don't have a deep, deep intimacy, but I think I can give you an overview of what's intended there. Recall, that the early observations were not conducted in a highly scientific trial with adjudication and follow up, et cetera. And so, the idea here is to actually have randomized patients, 400 in our case, and we wouldn't be surprised to see other companies following a similar standardized imaging protocol and that this would actually be analyzed, so this would be covered in the short-term under our study, and so it would be regular follow up as part of this study with all of the bells and whistles that go along with a PARTNER 3 Trial, and then these patients to be followed on a longer-term basis using the registry. So, there'd be a lot of science around this, and we'd have probably better data than we've ever had in the past.","And what we've been able to do is not just know whether there was some leaflet thickening that was viewed by imaging, but we get to find out is there a clinical consequence, were there any strokes, is there any mortality, is there any kind of clinical consequence to those kind of things, are they temporary and do they go away, et cetera. We'll get more data than we've ever had on this, so it should be informative.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matt Keeler of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, just first, getting back to your comment on U.S. hospitals seeing some TAVI capacity additions. I was wondering if you could quantify that in any way. Are these sort of 5% to 10% capacity increases something larger than that, is that broad-based or in a few large centers? And I'm just asking in the context of sort of in the context of indication expansion, how do you see the 400-plus centers today stacking up against this potentially large population?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Well, unfortunately, there is not a single theme here. We've seen a variety of behaviors across hospitals. Because of these procedures turn out to be shorter and more predictable, what it's done is it's encouraged hospitals. So within the same cath lab or within the same OR, they can get more cases per day. And also, some hospitals are looking at this, I think, relative to the demand out there and also their own economics and they are just adding extra days. So maybe in the past they used to do these cases only on Tuesday and now they might happen on multiple days per week in that same hospital. So for the most part, it's not, if you will, bricks and mortar that's driving the capacity increase, I think it's more of a redistribution of their own internal capacity combined with just the improving efficiency of these procedures.","Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks. And just my follow-up on the mitral feasibility. Can you give us any color around how many patients are expected to treat there and what you need to see before you decide to move forward?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. By its nature, the early feasibility studies are a low number of patients. And so, that's not going to be big. We expect there to be a lot of learning. As we said, it was going to be across seven centers. And so, it's good about that, we'll get a chance to see, is it reproducible, can it be done in the hands of multiple talented physicians? And so, that will be the learning for us. It won't be big data like you see in a big pivotal trial, it will more be learning for us. I don't know the specifics. I think the details will be posted on clintrials.gov (sic) [clinicaltrials.gov] (48:45), if it's not up there already.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on an awesome quarter. Just a follow-up on the low-risk trial. Mike, I was wondering if you could give color on what FDA had in hand at the time of making the decision to move forward. At that point in time, did they have the intermediate risk data? I mean I would assume that they would not move forward without knowing what that data is or at least having a very good sense. So, I was wondering if you could clarify.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks very much for the compliment. And to our knowledge (49:27), they do not have the intermediate risk, they do not know the results of the randomized intermediate risk trial, even at this point they don't know that. They did have the benefit of the SAPIEN 3 30-day data and I think mostly what they were encouraged by was the fact that here was going to be a very rigorous randomized study that was going to be done. So, they didn't have to count on exactly how things have played out on the intermediate front. They've obviously watched the data that was available closely. But I think this is more in the spirit of what we offered up was a highly rigorous study that's good science. So, I think they're highly interested and having that \u2013 to stay in front of clinical practice rather than let this slip away from them.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Okay. That's helpful. And then my next question is, as we do move into \u2013 intermediate risk coming online hopefully by year-end and then eventually low risk, at what point does cost effectiveness matter a lot more? And how do we think about that in the context of, number one, the clinical data that you collect, and number two, the potential impact to ASPs longer term? Because obviously you're talking about a significant increase in the addressable patient population and cost to the system.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think there are multiple factors that are going to influence the practice, and I think economics will certainly be a factor. They're going to \u2013 they'll look at how good is this clinical data. So, they'll look at things like mortality and stroke, they'll look at the economics, they'll look at the quality of life for these patients and the heart team assessments. So, that will all get baked into the ultimate decision-making. We know from our past here when procedures were unprofitable that was deterrent for hospitals. We think, under the current DRG, that the reimbursement is fair, and that most hospitals do pretty well on that. So, we don't think if it's a penalty like it might have been in the very early days of TAVR.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Mike, I think in your remarks you said that the intermediate data from the U.S. will be submitted in Europe. I think you said it, sometime this summer. What's the timeline in terms of getting an expanded label in Europe for intermediate?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's a good question. Yeah, that's exactly our strategy. We would take the data that becomes available right at the time of ACC and think about us packaging it right then and try and get it into our notified bodies. Our best guess is that it takes the most of 2016 to digest that, evaluate it, and fully probe it. So, hard to predict, but we would think that a 2017 approval would be likely in Europe.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just as a follow-up to that. Do you think this accelerates the European market? Is there any way you can quantify the number of patients that maybe on the sidelines in Europe that would benefit from this? Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. Yeah, I don't know if we have insight that's much deeper than yours. It's \u2013 we think it's common in Europe that their patients are on the sideline and that many people with AS don't get treated. And just because of the kind of world that we live in, this information is going to travel, it's going to travel fast, and European clinicians are going to become well aware of what was presented at the ACC. So, do I expect there to be some influence? Yes, I do. I think the movement of the label will be meaningful. The actual movement of any European guidelines will be meaningful. So those things will take some time. But I expect it to have impact, it's tough for us to assess exactly how fast.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good evening. And very nice quarter. To continue that thought process, my impression is that intermediate risk patients are already receiving SAPIEN 3 procedures now. So I guess, it's a two part question, how do you think this is really going to change the patients that are already being \u2013 have procedures on? But the second part of this is sort of what percentage of the patients in Europe do you think are intermediate risk already?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We think that the bulk of the patients that are being treated in Europe are high risk. If you track the average age of these patients it's consistently been over 80 years of age. And they go through a heart team assessment. And we sit here with our own definitions, but I think the heart teams have decided that these are high risk patients. They take a look at the opportunity for them to go through surgery, and they have assessed it as high risk in their own way of looking at it, and that's what the guidelines say.","So, it's difficult for us to say exactly what's going on right now, just because they have their way of assessing it, that's driven by their own heart teams. And I think those heart teams are doing the very best that they can.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then as a follow-up, what does it take for either in Europe or United States for them to change some of the guidelines, like a heart team assessment, at this stage, including a surgeon and an interventionist in the room seems a little silly, how deep we are in the clinical data and in the rollout of the product?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry, could you say it again? I want to make sure I get your question right.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","The question really is what does it take to change some of the operating room and patient identification guidelines, either in Europe or in the United States?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think the group is going to be highly data driven. They're going to take a hard look at this data, because they're going to have the highest quality data, probably more data on heart valve patients than ever has been available before, and that's going to influence them writing the guidelines. And I think you're specifically talking about guidelines not the NCD I assume, right?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matt Miksic of UBS. Please go ahead.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for taking our questions. Covered a lot of these issues, but I had just a couple of follow-ups, one on the gross margin for Scott, and you talked about this 1%, roughly hit to Q4 gross margins around this Critical Care changes that you made in manufacturing, that flows through to this year. Is the right way to thinking, since you're kind of holding gross margins for this year, is the right way to think of the offsets to that, because you do have, as was mentioned, sort of more favorable mix, slightly higher TAVR, is the right offset to that just FX? How should we think about that sort of staying the same then?","Scott B. Ullem - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. Well, there's a lot going on in operations, generally, Critical Care and the rest of the company, as we continue to grow. And so the 74% to 75% guidance for 2016 reflects what we're investing in the business. And you're right, the 1% for Critical Care was part of the operations investments we made in Q4 that brought it down from our original 75% expectation.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So, all right. So, there are just a lot of moving parts there, I guess, is the right way to think about it. The second was on the subject of intermediate, and to what degree we're already seeing some of that happening here in the U.S. and certainly in Europe. And I'd love to get your thoughts, Mike, on how far along do you think the U.S. clinicians are in terms of their comfort, and taking a risk classification of four or five or something below the high risk level and together with the heart team deciding, okay, this is really ought to be a transcatheter valve based on frailty or the other things you talked about in the past.","Is that sort of pervasive? Is it a wave that's moving across the community over time? And then, also importantly, how do think that gets affected by the data, assuming it's favorable presented here at ACC?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's a great question. We've tried to talk about it before. Remember, risk scores were established based on the risk to go through open heart procedures. Right? And so, again, that was the context. For example, age was not even part of a risk score. You can be over 90 and considered low risk. Many clinicians look at that today and say, boy, I have a tough time believing that this 95-year-old is low risk, but that is the way that the STS score can characterize it today.","What's good news for patients is, every one of those patients go through a heart team assessment. That's part of what the FDA label calls for and also what the CMS, NCD calls for. And so risk scores are helpful, but they're not the only indicators that are used by clinicians. They'll include frailty, other factors like a hostile chest, et cetera, when they go through their assessment. So we think people are being very diligent in terms of the way that they treat patients today. And I think you'd be misled to believe that there is some kind of broad use already by intermediate risk patients.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Josh Jennings of Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about PARTNER 3 Trial design about the follow-up period, if you guys could delineate that and if it is 24 months, will there be an interim analysis at the 12-month follow-up period?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So you're talking about \u2013 I want to make sure I'm clear. Were you asking about PARTNER II or PARTNER 3?","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","PARTNER 3.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, yeah, it is a one-year follow-up, right.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great.","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So is that your question?","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","That clears it up. Thanks. And do you have any \u2013 just on your comments earlier about the FDA not seeing intermediate risk data before moving forward with the approval of the IDE for PARTNER 3. Do you have any sense in terms of your discussion with the Agency on what that means for your competition in terms of what are the criteria, what type of data they need in terms of which risk class in order to move forward with the low risk trial?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know what the implications are for competition in terms of low risk trial. Obviously, we reached agreement with FDA by proposing this very robust trial, 1,300 patients with \u2013 over age 65 with all of the adjudication that's associated with it. So very high quality research. And I would imagine that others would also follow that pathway, so.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Bruce Nudell of SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks for squeezing me in. Mike, two questions. One, we certainly agree with you that most of this growth is going to be coming from, like, three-quarters from patients who are 75 and older who would otherwise not be treated.","Firstly, in the U.S., is there anything you need to do to proactively kind of recruit those patients or do you think just diffusion of the idea of TAVR will be enough to get them in the door over time? And secondly, ex-U.S., will there be a different sensitivity with regards to treating untreated 80-year-olds or can we view the ex-U.S. markets as roughly equivalent to the United States in that regard?","Michael A. Mussallem - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good questions, Bruce, and thanks for those. Yeah, in terms of recruitment, you can imagine, if you're a low risk patient and today your only option is an open heart valve replacement, if you had an option to enter a clinical trial where you could get a transcatheter procedure, that might be attractive to you. So we don't expect to do anything unusual in terms of that. We continually try and support organizations like the ACC and the American Heart Association and individual hospitals as they raise awareness, but you shouldn't expect anything unusual beyond that.","In terms of OUS and what's going to be their policies, it's probably going to be driven primarily by how they approach it from a reimbursement perspective. And so, what we're going to be prepared to do as part of our low risk trial is to also gather information on economics, gather information on the quality of life for these patients so that we can have a meaningful conversation with these payers around the world. And what we're encouraged by is, we think you get a pretty good bang for the buck in terms of the quality of life and the extension of life with this kind of technology compared to many other kinds of healthcare. And we'd like to think that we can back it up with data.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks so much.","Michael A.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Mark Wilterding","Thanks, Diego and thank you all for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released its third quarter 2019 financial results.

Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Mike Mussallem","Thanks Mark. We're very pleased to report strong third quarter results, which reflected a large increase in the number of patients who were treated with transcatheter heart valve therapy.","Our sales growth this quarter was significantly higher than we expected. Sales grew in the double digits in all regions globally and increased 19% on an underlying basis to $1.1 billion led by transcatheter aortic valve replacement.","We're also pleased to report growing investments in new therapies and clear progress in numerous clinical trials that we believe will have meaningful future impact. More importantly, even more patients are benefiting from our lifesaving technologies than ever before.","In TAVR, third quarter global sales were $700 million, up 27% on an underlying basis. Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the U.S. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth in the mid-20% range. Globally our average selling price remains stable as we continue to exercise pricing discipline.","In the U.S., we estimated total TAVR procedures grew around 30% on a year-over-year basis and that Edwards' growth was comparable. Stronger than expected growth was driven by an unexpected bolus of TAVR treatments following the strong PARTNER 3 evidence that led to the recent FDA indication expansion for our SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra systems. This approval represents a significant milestone, which allows all patients diagnosed with severe AS to be considered for TAVR based on their individual needs and anatomical considerations versus traditional risk warning.","Growth this quarter was broad-based across the U.S. Outside the U.S. in the third quarter we estimated total TAVR procedures grew just over 20% on a year-over-year basis and Edwards' growth was comparable. We continue to be encouraged by the strong international adoption of TAVR particularly where overall therapy penetration is still very low.","In Europe, Edwards' growth was in the teens and we estimate that our competitive position was stable. Although transcatheter valves have been commercially available for over a decade in Europe, it's encouraging to note that demand remains strong.","Outside the U.S. and Europe, we continue to see strong TAVR adoption driven by SAPIEN 3. Sales growth in Japan and other regions was very strong as aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease, and we remain focused on increasing the availability of TAVR therapy.","As we've discussed, we remain pleased with the SAPIEN 3 Ultra valve's performance and clinician feedback continues to be very positive. The valve offers the modified outer skirt which includes a proprietary material designed to further reduce paravalvular leaks.","We decided to accelerate the previously announced migration to the proven SAPIEN 3 delivery system, and at the same time are finalizing improvements of our Ulta delivery system.","The updated rollout plan is expected to ramp over the next several quarters. As such, we now believe that SAPIEN 3 Ultra will account for most of our TAVR sales in U.S. and Europe in 2020. This updated plan contributed to a charge to this quarter. I'm pleased to provide an update to our early TAVR clinical trial, which is now approximately half enrolled.","Recall that this is a large first-of-a-kind trial focused on indication expansion for patients suffering from severe AS, who haven't yet reported symptoms. Enrollment continues at nearly 65 sites throughout the U.S. and we now anticipate completion in 2021 versus our initial expectation of 2020. We continue to believe that Early TAVR has the potential to change the way that clinicians approach and manage AS patients to prevent irreversible damage.","Finally, as you heard at last month's TCT, clinical trial results were presented demonstrating early and sustained quality-of-life advantages for severe AS patients at low surgical risk treated with SAPIEN 3. Taken together with the clinical superiority demonstrated in the PARTNER 3 trial these quality-of-life findings further support the use of TAVR in these patients.","In summary, given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we're raising our full year TAVR guidance. We now expect underlying growth of nearly 20% versus our previous expectation of around 15%.","In addition, while still early in the 2020 forecasting process and difficult to predict, we are modeling a return to low-double-digit growth TAVR procedures globally next year. This is consistent with our estimate of a $7 billion opportunity in 2024.","Based on the trend of our 2019 results, it's likely that in 2020 we will report slower second half growth given the higher year-over-year comparisons. We are encouraged that the TAVR opportunity remains robust and believe that our continuing innovations will sustain our strong global position.","In transcatheter mitral tricuspid therapies or TMTT, we made important progress in the third quarter in advancing our portfolio of technologies to bring meaningful solutions to underserved mitral and tricuspid patients with few options today.","In the third quarter, global revenue was $10 million. The bulk of this was commercial sales of PASCAL in Europe. We are pleased with the disciplined rollout of PASCAL focusing on physician training, procedural success and patient outcomes. While we continue to receive positive physician feedback on this differentiated therapy, our premium-price strategy was a contributor to the slightly lower than expected revenue.","And now I'll give you a brief recap of select developments. In mitral valve repair, we continue to enroll our CLASP IID U.S. pivotal trial to study PASCAL in primary or degenerative mitral valve disease.","We have also initiated enrollment on our CLASP IIF pivotal trial for patients with secondary or functional mitral valve disease. In line with our commitment to build a strong body of clinical evidence, we recently presented positive one-year results in 30 patients from our European CLASP study at TCT.","We were especially encouraged by the low rate of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalization as well as an impressive substantial and sustained reduction in mitral regurgitation. Patients also experienced clinically and statistically significant improvements in functional status, exercise capability and quality of life.","In mitral valve replacement, we're pleased with the ongoing early feasibility study experience with both EVOQUE and SAPIEN M3 transseptal therapies and we remain on track to initiate a U.S. pivotal trial of SAPIEN M3 before the end of the year. Data highlighting the latest clinical experience with these platforms were presented at TCT demonstrating feasibility, an acceptable safety profile and a significant MR reduction with both therapies.","Turning to transcatheter tricuspid repair, in the second quarter we made the decision to accelerate a PASCAL tricuspid pivotal trial by the end of this year. We were pleased that in September, we received FDA approval for our Class II TR pivotal trial to study PASCAL in patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation. We plan to start activating sites by the end of the year.","At TCT, we highlighted the latest data from our Cardioband tricuspid early feasibility study demonstrating acceptable safety and performance with significant TR reduction at 30 days.","In summary for full year 2019 Edwards now expects TMTT revenue to be below $40 million as the company continues a disciplined introduction and premium pricing strategy which is moderating site activation.","In addition, while still early in the 2020 forecasting process, our plan anticipates doubling 2019 TMTT sales in 2020. We remain on-track to achieve our ambitious 2019 clinical milestones which include continued enrollment in our CLASP pivotal trials as well as initiating the SAPIEN 3 pivotal trial -- the SAPIEN M3 pivotal trial by the end of the year.","We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach approximately $3 billion by 2024 and our passion about bringing a portfolio of solutions for patients in need.","In Surgical Structural Heart, sales for the third quarter of $204 million increased 3% on an underlying basis. Our growth was driven by continued adoption of our premium high-value technologies and strength outside the U.S. This was partially offset by lower surgical aortic valve procedures in the U.S. as TAVR adoption expanded.","We remain very encouraged with the steady adoption of INSPIRIS RESILIA tissue valves. In the third quarter, valve utilization grew in all regions driven by increased demand among younger and more active patients. INSPIRIS is becoming the surgical valve standard of care in many geographies around the world.","Separately we continue to expect European regulatory approval for our HARPOON beating heart mitral valve repair system around the end of the year. HARPOON offers the potential for earlier treatment of degenerative mitral valve disease and faster recovery at more consistent outcomes for surgical patients.","In summary although the superiority results of PARTNER 3 in the recent indication expansion for TAVR are expected to provide an incremental headwind to our aortic surgical sales, we continue to expect full year underlying sales growth of 1% to 3% based on our year-to-date results.","We remain excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and to extend our global leadership in premium Surgical Structural Heart technologies.","In Critical Care sales for the quarter were $180 million and grew 7% on an underlying basis. Our product lines and geographies contributed to this performance with strong growth boosted by HemoSphere, our all-in-one monitoring platform.","We received FDA clearance in the third quarter to use FORE-SIGHT a cerebral oximetry technology from the CASMED acquisition on HemoSphere. The integration of our full range of technologies at HemoSphere will create a unique offering of enhanced recovery tools and predictive analytics capabilities to further strengthen our leadership in smart monitoring.","In summary, given the sustained growth through the first three quarters of the year and the expected momentum from the fully integrated HemoSphere platform in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect full year 2019 underlying sales growth of 8% to 10%.","And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Ullem","Thank you, Mike. We continued our impressive top line performance this quarter with underlying sales growth of 19% reflecting global strength across all regions. Particularly strong was our 27% underlying growth in TAVR, which benefited from the recent clinical evidence supporting our SAPIEN 3 therapy.","Growth in the quarter was aided by onetime items contributing approximately 200 basis points to growth, largely related to the increased number of billing days versus prior year and forward buying ahead of the consumption tax change in Japan.","Our adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter of $1.41 grew 32% over the prior year driven by our notable sales performance. We achieved this growth while maintaining our significant investments in research and development, primarily on our transcatheter structural heart programs.","During the third quarter, we recorded an additional $27 million charge primarily inventory related to the last quarter's strategic decisions regarding our transcatheter aortic valve portfolio. This charge combined with other normal recurring adjustments reduced our third quarter GAAP earnings per share to $1.30.","Including the second quarter charge, the 2019 impact of the discontinuation of CENTERA and revised Ultra rollout plan is $73 million. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.","I'll now cover the details of our third quarter results and then discuss guidance for 2019. For the quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.9% compared to 75.5% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven primarily by the favorable impacts from foreign exchange and product mix, partially offset by spending in support of the new European device regulations and manufacturing variances. We expect our full year 2019 adjusted gross profit margin to be consistent with our year-to-date rate.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $306 million or 28% of sales. This 14% increase over the prior year was driven by transcatheter structural heart field personnel-related expenses including expanding the transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapy field organization in Europe. We continue to expect SG&A excluding special items to be between 28% and 29% of sales for the full year 2019.","Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 21% over the prior year to $195 million or 17.9% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of significant investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs including generating clinical evidence. For the full year 2019, we continue to expect R&D excluding special items to be between 17% and 18% of sales.","Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate was 8.9% for the quarter or 10.8% excluding the impact of special items. Stock appreciation this year drove a 580 basis point benefit or $0.09 from the accounting for employee stock-based compensation. Our tax rate also benefited from recently passed tax reform in Switzerland. We now expect our full year 2019 tax rate excluding special items to be at the bottom of our previous guidance range of 12% to 14%, which reflects the increased benefit of the accounting for employee stock-based compensation.","Foreign exchange rates decreased third quarter sales growth versus the prior year by less than 1% or $6 million versus the prior year. At current rates, we continue to estimate an approximate $60 million negative impact or about 1.5% to full year 2019 sales compared to the prior year. FX rates positively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 130 basis points versus the prior year. Relative to our July guidance, FX rates had less than $0.01 impact on earnings per share reflecting our effective currency hedging program.","Adjusted free cash flow for the third quarter was $319 million defined as cash flow from operating activities of $437 million less capital spending of $76 million and excluding a $42 million tax benefit related to our previously announced global intellectual property litigation settlement. Our year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow which excludes the litigation settlement and related tax benefit was $735 million.","We now expect full year 2019 adjusted free cash flow to be above the top end of our previous $800 million to $900 million guidance range. We remain on track in implementing capital expansion projects, in line with our strategy to increase global capacity.","Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we have cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $1.4 billion. Total debt was $594 million. Average shares outstanding during the quarter remained level with the prior quarter at 212 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2019 to be between 211 million and 213 million.","And now finishing up with our 2019 guidance. Given our strong year-to-date performance, we are increasing our sales guidance ranges for Edwards and for TAVR. For total Edwards, we now expect sales around the top of our previous $4.0 billion to $4.3 billion range. And for TAVR, we now expect sales around the top of our previous $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion range with underlying sales growth of nearly 20%.","For TMTT, we now expect sales to be below $40 million. We continue to expect Surgical Structural Heart sales of $810 million to $850 million; and Critical Care sales including CASMED around the top end of our $700 million to $750 million range.","We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $5.50 to $5.65, up from our previous guidance of $5.20 to $5.40. For the fourth quarter of 2019, at current foreign exchange rates, we project total sales to be between $1.12 billion and $1.16 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.55.","And with that I'll pass it back to Mike.","Mike Mussallem","Thanks Scott. We're very pleased with our strong year-to-date performance. As patients and clinicians increasingly choose TAVR, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunity. We are committed to aggressively investing in our future, consistent with our focused innovation strategy. We remain confident that the innovative therapies resulting from our investments will benefit a broader group of patients suffering from structural heart disease and continue to drive strong organic growth.","And with that I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Wilterding","Thanks Mike. Before we open it up for questions, I would like to remind you about our 2019 Investor Conference on Thursday, December 5th in New York City. This event will include updates on our latest technologies, news on longer-term market potential, as well as our outlook for 2020. More information and a registration form are available on our website. We're ready to take questions now.","In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one, plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please state your question.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thanks and good afternoon. First off just congratulations on such a nice third quarter. Mike I just wanted to make sure that I'm hearing the messaging right on your kind of new views on the TAVR market -- or updated views I should say.","I guess the message I'm hearing is that despite obviously a very, very strong performance in Q3, you're not really changing your views on the ultimate size of the market or the time that it will take to get there.","I guess my first impression of that related to strength is that that seems increasingly like a conservative estimate and timeframe unless I'm missing something else that's new. I'm just wondering if you could comment on that.","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Thanks Bob. Well, you know we've always felt the TAVR opportunity was large and growing and we know that the superiority results are helpful. We caution reading too much into one quarter's result. We continue to think that we'll know more about it over time, but right now, we would encourage you to think about this broad growth rate that we've talked about over time.","We struggled some time to estimate quarters accurately. We -- if you go back to our guidance in December, we thought that the TAVR opportunity would grow from $3.5 billion in 2018 to $7 billion in 2024. We still think that that's a reasonable trajectory. We'll take a hard look at it, and if we have an update we'll share that certainly in the future.","Bob Hopkins","Great. That's fair enough. And then just one quick follow-up for Scott, you offered a few things about 2020 that we should consider. Just curious, if there's any other things that you think we should consider for 2020 modeling purposes? And I know you have like for example, one thing that I think people are curious about is just you have a lot of trials going on great revenue growth. Is 2020 a year where you still think you can \u2013 you'll deliver leveraged earnings growth? Thank you.","Scott Ullem","Well, that's certainly our objective. We try to inch up operating profit margins every year. And we're not perfectly consistent at it, but that's certainly the objective over the long term. I think the other things to think about in 2020 are we are going to continue to invest aggressively in research and development. And every time we think we've gotten it right we end up with programs coming online and other programs rolling off. But I think you're going to see us continuing to address it at relatively high levels of R&D. Don't expect it to go back down to 14% or 15% where we were a few years ago.","The last thing, I'd say is just on gross profit I think we're going to see downward pressure on our gross profit margin, because we've got the benefit of some of these FX \u2013 currency hedges rolling through FX this year. And so we're not ready to quantify that yet, but I expect our gross profit guidance probably will not be as robust next year as it was this year.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.","David Lewis","Great. Good afternoon. Just two quick ones for me. Mike, I thought I'd just start with PASCAL here. Just, if you could parse out sort of the PASCAL launch dynamics. Like initially, it was a disciplined launch focused on outcomes. This quarter you raised your premium pricing strategy. So, what's the bigger rate limiter? Is it more this disciplined launch or is it more your pricing strategy? And then what changes in 2020 to give the comfort that this business can double? And I have a quick follow-up for Scott.","Mike Mussallem","Yeah. Thanks David. So know that this launch plan has always been there. That's what we called for. We go through very careful site selection position training patient screening and case support so that's not really different. But we are executing a premium price strategy, because of the differentiated technology that we have and also this high-touch clinical support. That premium price strategy is moderating our site activation plan. So that's what's changed it. Was there a second part to the question David?","David Lewis","What changes Mike in the next year? I mean, this business is going to double as you suggested. Do you change your strategy next year or do you think the this strategy you're employing in 2019 can get you to doubling this business next year?","Mike Mussallem","It \u2013 we do believe it's a strategy. It will be an increase in the number of sites. They are limited today and we'll be adding sites in a disciplined fashion. We've gotten great feedback from clinicians and so that will be the primary driver.","David Lewis","Okay. Very helpful. And then Scott you talked about gross margins for next year and I appreciate the update. When you just think about this particular quarter obviously given the strength in TAVR gross margins probably weren't as strong as we were expecting so you mentioned manufacturing variances. But can you just help us quantify any impact from Ultra CENTERA or FX on gross margins this particular quarter? Thanks. Thanks so much.","Scott Ullem","Sure. Let me take you through some of the different moving pieces that hit gross margin. We had the benefit of these hedged contracts, I've mentioned before. That was probably about 130 basis point contributor to the 75.9% non-GAAP gross margin. It was offset by these manufacturing costs. And I think one of the good examples of what's flowing through there is these new European EU device regulations that end-up costing us money. There were some inefficiencies associated with moving delivery system production around in connection with this Ultra delivery system strategy we've talked about. So that did run through manufacturing cost and was contributor to some of the negative variances. We also had some benefit of mix. And you roll that all up together again and that's how we gone up 40 basis points versus 2018 third quarter.","David Lewis","Is it possible Scott that the impact of CENTERA and Ultra was more than 100 basis points this quarter?","Scott Ullem","Well, I think there are two pieces \u2013 were called out. One was a special charge, right? But in terms of the gross margin impact, no I don't think it's more than 100 basis points this quarter. I think it would be less than that.","David Lewis","Okay. Thanks so much.","Mark Wilterding","Next question, Diego.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.","Larry Biegelsen","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. And congrats on a really strong quarter here. Mike, I wanted to start with the 2020 outlook for TAVR procedure growth in the low double-digits that you talked about in the press release and in your prepared remarks. I mean you're calling for about 20%, this year you've grown in line with the market. You just got the low-risk approval in late August. So why do you think the market will slow so much next year? And I had one follow-up.","Mike Mussallem","Yes I'm not so sure. We struggle with this Larry, because it's tough for us to call these quarters. I'm not sure it's about slowing next year. I think we saw a bolus this year. So we believe that most of what we saw last quarter and this quarter was the result of those spectacular results in PARTNER 3 which ultimately led to an FDA approval.","And we think that that stimulated patients, educated physicians, it increased awareness and that combination started patients moving through the system. They don't move through the system so fast but we think it was a real stimulus to the system. So if you will we might have even pulled a little bit of that forward. So that's the way that we end up thinking about we're still going to have half the usage next year. The growth rates are going to look lower in comparison to the second half of 2019.","Larry Biegelsen","That's helpful. And then Mike your surgical heart valve business, I heard your comments in your prepared remarks, but I'm curious about 2020 and beyond. We've heard anecdotes that TAVR procedures could be down 20% to 30% next year in the U.S. given the strength of the low-risk data and indication. How confident are you feeling you could still kind of state -- keep that business growing or even flat looking ahead? Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Larry. One of the factors although not as big as new patients coming off the sidelines were patients that might have been treated with surgery or treated with TAVR even now in the third quarter. So when you think of a big TAVR growth rate and that we've withstood that and grew 3% in the third quarter, it bolsters our confidence about the future. Is it going to be challenging?","Do we think TAVR is going to continue to have an impact on surgeries? Of course, it will. But I'm not sure that that's going to get much worse in the future. We think there's probably been kind of a step-change here with the PARTNER 3 data and that over time that probably moderates as well.","Larry Biegelsen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys congrats on a really nice quarter here. But back on the TAVR 2020 question. I want to approach it from a slightly different angle. Given the headline numbers on PARTNER 3 data, they came in much better. Shouldn't we be expecting maybe Edwards to do better than the market? I mean the overall market could be low doubles but shouldn't the better clinical data reflect in numbers?","Scott Ullem","Of course, we're proud of our data. Nobody is more proud. And we do everything we can to have that message out there but you have to also recognize that in the single biggest market in the world, the U.S. we've got new competitors that are coming in. And at this point I don't think we've really felt that in a large way. So whether it's trialing or an actual adoption we think that will have some impact. And so we stay kind of balanced on if we can grow like the market that's really not so bad.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful, Mike. And then one on mitral. So the M3 trial, which was slated the start of year-end is that -- do you have clarity on what the trial design is what the comparator arm is? Will this be a key F approach or -- I'm just curious on any additional details.","Mike Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Vijay. We don't have anything to share at this point. We're in discussions on that. And for competitive reasons while it's still early and it's not clear we don't share exact trial design. So at this point we really don't have anything new to add in that regard. Once it's clear of course it will get posted on clinicaltrials.gov and then we'll make it clear to everyone.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. I appreciate the volume commentary to let us back into Japan growth. It's starting to become a more material contributor here. Wondering if you could help us with the financial impact from the stocking ahead of the tax starting? And also maybe just some color on the market and what you're seeing there?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah. So in Japan there was a consumption tax that was put in place, I want to say around the 30th of September. And we heard reports that some Japan customers did some TAVR stocking. We think it's just less than $2 million worth of stocking that took place there. So that gives you a rough idea of that if that's your question.","Robbie Marcus","Yeah. No, that's helpful. And now with the new NCD in place, how are you thinking about the -- not just the expansion of TAVR centers, but the shifting in volumes of TAVR centers? Do you expect these \u2013 well, a, how many of new centers are you expecting and over what time frame? And b, are you expecting them to be incremental volumes to the system? Or do you expect them to cannibalize from the existing volumes out there? Thanks.","Mike Mussallem","Yeah. So we were pleased with the way that the NCD turned out. And I think our estimate at that time is that it would add approximately 200 new sites. These would be sites that could achieve the eligibility.","Now I don't know whether all of those will do that in the near term except for some. It might take some time. I think by and large we believe, yes. Will it take from of some other centers, yes, probably to a small extent. We believe that there's still a greatly underserved market and that it is somewhat additive to the total as those new centers come on.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks a lot.","Mike Mussallem","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Please state your question. Matt Taylor, your line is open.","Matt Taylor","Sorry about that. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on the TMTT comments on next year. Could you talk about just in broad strokes, how much of that you expect to be from PASCAL? And how are you thinking about your annular devices? And also if you could give maybe an update on replacement that would be helpful?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. So, yes, just to go in the opposite order here. The bulk of this is likely to come from PASCAL. We'll try and paint a more complete picture. The replacement devices will be in clinical trial, so that won't have a big impact on the number. And right now our Cardioband product is still relatively small. We're gaining experience. We get a lot of positive feedback there, but by comparison, it's going to be more PASCAL.","Matt Taylor","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Please state your question.","Jason Mills","Great. Thanks Mike. Sorry about the background noise. I\u2019m traveling. Congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to start on mitral. With respect to your long-term views sort of a long-term question, $3 billion by 2024. How do you anticipate that breaking up U.S. versus OUS? And at that point in time understanding there's a lot of clinical evidence yet to be accumulated, do you expect Edwards will be if not a leader closing in on a leadership position at that point in time? Just trying to get a sense for trajectory as we look at your long-term projections in mitral.","Mike Mussallem","Yeah. So it's a great point. So I don't have an exact breakout of U.S. versus OUS. Given the earlier approval of OUS big head start for OUS, but you know that U.S. is a rapid adopter. So that's going to be a little tricky to predict. But that is -- it does include some bumps for the U.S. I think the bigger thing Jason is we're not suggesting $3 billion is where it stops in 2024.","We feel like that's just where it gets going. We're focused on the long term in that regard. We'll try and provide some more clarity as we get to the investor conference, but right now I would say that's sort of a signpost along the way.","Jason Mills","Okay. Thank you for that Mike. And then, Scott, on your commentary with respect to operating margins to Bob's question, if we assume that R&D is not a source of leverage next year and potentially SG&A is, maybe talk about SG&A trending as we look at not only 2020. But does your commentary of previous Analyst Days hold true as we stand today in terms of seeing downward pressure on that line as a percentage of sales and perhaps if we do see leverage in 2020 that's where we would get it?","Scott Ullem","Well, I think, there are a couple of things that are influencing it, both in 2020 and beyond. One is, we're trying to scale our growth and be really efficient with overhead and administrative and back-office type expenses that run through SG&A.","At the same time, we're investing aggressively in things like field resources who are supporting clinical cases. And so, I think, those two -- it's tuff to tell what the balance is going to look like, but over time, I guess, I'll just leave it as, we're going to try to be very efficient in SG&A. And we'll give you more update about what that looks like in 2020 in a couple of months when we get to our investor conference.","Jason Mills","Got it. Thank you both.","Mark Wilterding","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please state your question.","Raj Denhoy","Hi. Good afternoon. Maybe just a couple of clarifications. On the CLASP studies, the F&D studies in the United States, I don't believe you've given us time lines for U.S. approval. I know you're enrolling both of them, but you haven't really given us much in terms of how that enrollment is going and when we might see those products get approved in the United States.","Mike Mussallem","I think, that's right, we haven't talked about approval. So, we say that we are on track for our enrollment and so we'll -- we may have more details to report at the investor conference. But right now I think our report is that we're on track with enrolling and really we haven't put sort of completions in place, because we're still relatively early.","Raj Denhoy","Okay. That's fair. And maybe just a quick one on competition. You mentioned you are being a little conscious in your outlook, given potential competition in the United States. But as you mentioned, you haven't seen much yet from LOTUS and some of the updates -- or the update, I suppose, on Portico coming out of TCT was perhaps a little underwhelming. And so, I guess, I'm curious what your current thinking is on competition and the potential impact competition will have over the next, call it, 12 to 24 months in the U.S.","Mike Mussallem","Yes. We expect it to have impact. These are really good companies. We tend to think that our technology is pretty substantially superior, so we think that's going to give us a big advantage. But these are good companies that have great relationships out there and we think that they will have some impact.","Raj Denhoy","Okay. Fair enough. Congratulations on a good quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.","Matt Miksic","Hi. Thanks. Wanted to -- I think, we've covered the strength, really impressive I should say, strength in U.S. TAVR in the quarter again. But wanted to maybe get a sense of where sort of your activity is, or your involvement in new center initiation and training, just because it sounds like one of your U.S. peers has sort of redoubled their efforts on that front. And wondering if that requires a response from you, or you're sort of business as usual, or maybe just some comments on that front. And I have one follow-up.","Mike Mussallem","Yes. I'd probably call it a little bit more business as usual. We're fortunate to be the leader in this space and we still -- our approach on a regular basis. I'll say, one of the things that's been -- kept our team pretty busy this quarter, as you can imagine, with a 30% bump in U.S. procedures, we cover all those cases.","So our team did a pretty incredible effort just to be able to cover all this bolus of patients that's come through. So have we pivoted to starting new centers? No, not in a big way, but of course we support them. And we think that will be gradual and grow over time.","Matt Miksic","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on the OUS environment. I know your focus is on the U.S. and there's been a lot of conversation around that, but you have a premium-priced strategy in TAVR OUS. I think this time last year, it seemed and it felt like -- duel check and your comments, I think, that the pressure on pricing was maybe a touch heavier. And I don't know, if we're annualizing that, or you've seen a change in that environment incremental year-over-year. So, again, any color you have in that regard.","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Well the one thing I could speak of with certainty is our discipline. We continue to exercise a lot of price discipline. If anything, I would say, there might be even more price pressure. We've watched some competitors get even more aggressive over time so some pretty, pretty significant differences, which is disappointing. We think it may be one of those things where it's tougher to compete, are on evidence and technology and so they're turning to price a little bit more aggressively. But that's the general environment.","Matt Miksic","Well, congrats on the solid results there. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please state your question.","Rick Wise","Good afternoon, everybody. Mike, maybe if you could talk a little more about Ultra and the Ultra rollout from a couple of vantage points. What's left to do in terms of ramping the device? It sounds like it's going to ramp up in the next few quarters. You're very clear that it's going to be most of the product sales in 2020 -- for most of 2020.","How would you have us think about Ultra? Is it a growth accelerator? Is it a share gainer? And just as part of the question for you Scott how do we think about the impact on gross margins? Does it -- has it been a gross margin drag that turns into a positive as you launch it? Or no it's the opposite as volume grows and you move down the learning curve? Just any color on all of those kinds of things. That will be it for me. Thank you, Mike.","Mike Mussallem","All right. Thanks, Rick. So let's just start from the top. We're really pleased with Ultra. We think it's a great valve. We love this feature. We think the reduction of paravalvular leak is going to become more and more important over time. There's going to be increased competition. If Ultra allows us to just protect our existing positions as leader we'll be pleased with that. So I think that's probably what you should expect. From a margin perspective, I'll let Scott comment.","Scott Ullem","We're in the early days Rick as you know we've been making some changes here. There will be a headwind to gross margin but it's really not something you're going to see externally. And over time it'll have substantially similar margins to SAPIEN 3.","Rick Wise","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please state your question.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. Scott can you circle back to the 200 basis point sales benefit you called out? How much of that was selling day versus Japan? And was that selling day impact making up for one less that you had in the prior quarter?","Scott Ullem","Days -- and yes we had about a 1% headwind in the first half. And so this third quarter we've had literally -- most of the 2% tailwind was in fact selling days. A very small piece was the Japan preorder.","Chris Pasquale","Okay. And then Mike just following up on Larry's question about the surgical valve business can you give us a sense of how much of your procedure mix at this point is those premium products INSPIRIS and INTUITY? Just wondering how long positive mix can still be a tailwind there to help offset the lower volumes.","Mike Mussallem","Yes, so at this point it's been growing pretty significantly. On the aortic side, it probably accounts for 50% or more of our volume and it's growing pretty quickly. So it's a pretty significant portion. It's becoming really the valve of choice in a number of regions.","Chris Pasquale","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Please state your question.","Josh Jennings","Hi. Good evening. Congrats again on the results. I wanted to start off on just asymptomatic opportunity. I think Mike you commented on EARLY TAVR I think enrollment being pushed out? And just wanted to get some updated thoughts on asymptomatic, and just is the enrollment pushed out due to some of these patients just screening in and being determined symptomatic upon sort of more rigorous interrogation by clinicians or stress testing?","Mike Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, Josh. So we've had really fast enrollment in all of our PARTNER trials. That's really been a remarkable. And PARTNER 3 was a homerun. But when we get into this trial now we're talking about patients that are not only -- not on indication, but they're not on guidelines. Right now what guidelines say is you only treat patients that have AS and symptoms. And so many centers don't even acknowledge these and save it. And so it's been kind of bumpy and then it's just been a slower process because it's a first of a kind trial and it's a really big one. So we wish it was going faster -- not worried about the implications of this trial.","Josh Jennings","Understood. And just on bicuspid if -- we've just had some anecdotal feedback about just the label and the current language maybe limiting some bicuspid utilization and just the low risk indication primarily. And the reason I asked the question is just -- the question is what are you getting from the field? Are low-risk bicuspid cases being done in these early days? Or is that a whole another leg where, with label updates, that bicuspid opportunity could open up more fully. Thanks for taking the questions.","Mike Mussallem","Yeah. So you're suggesting our growth rate could have been higher if we treated more bicuspid patients? No, I'm just being funny now, right? So it's -- I think as we indicated before bicuspid is not off-label and we do continue to see many of these patients who get treated. They're younger. They have other issues. They often need different procedures. And so, that's often the case why they don't require TAVR therapy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.","Pito Chickering","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike, before you used the word bolus when talking about TAVR growth this quarter. How should we think the bolus that we're having with low-risk patients? And how long do you think this bolus can last?","Mike Mussallem","That's a good question. So, we think what started the bolus was the report on the PARTNER 3 results. The superiority was pretty eye-popping that we think that drove a lot of discussion, awareness and so forth. One of the things about that we've learned about TAVR patients is even from when the decision gets made, they don't move through the system so fast. Many times it does take them longer than 90 days. So, if some of those patients got activated around that time frame, it's not surprising that they would show up in Q3.","So, we think we're seeing sort of a bump in demand here started in the second quarter, see it in the third, some more in the fourth and we reach a new level. But we think -- as we say, we think that growth rate moderates over time to what we think of as more consistent with our long-term expectations.","Pito Chickering","Okay. Fair enough. And then second question. So your U.S. sales force is obviously quite busy this quarter sort of filling that 30% demand you guys saw. When do you think you\u2019ll change your sales and marketing efforts to target more of the general cardiologists to help keep the low-risk patients coming in?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah. So we don't ever anticipate providing less service to our existing customers. Our model is a high-touch model, and we do everything within our power to make sure that each patient has a really successful result. You're on a good point. We do find high level of variability between the understanding the general cardiologists have. Some do a great job of staying current and others are somewhat dated in their understanding of what therapy options are. So there is a job for us to do there, and we are taking that on to some extent. We're -- that's one that we're ramping over time as we're learning how to do that and how to do that effectively.","Pito Chickering","Great. Thanks so much and great quarter.","Mike Mussallem","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question for today comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Please state your question.","Jayson Bedford","Good afternoon. . Thanks for taking the questions. I just had a quick follow-up on PASCAL. Does the doubling of revenue in 2020 stem more from entering new geographies? Or are you expecting any change in reimbursement in the regions you're currently in to help stimulate growth?","Mike Mussallem","Yeah. A good chunk of it is indeed new geographies that -- we've probably gone to a very limited number of customers, a limited number of geographies so far. So yes, there'll be some more penetration in the existing geographies that we're in like Germany, but we'll be entering new geographies as well.","Jayson Bedford","Okay. And just as a quick one. The low double-digit TAVR growth in 2020, any way you can comment on U.S. versus international trends there?","Mike Mussallem","It was kind of preliminary for us. We wanted to put it out there just so to give you some kind of guidance. We're going to try and get into that more deeply. But rather than sort of speculate on something that turns into a foul ball, we just thought it'd be better for us to give you a high-level look and then we'll get deeper as time goes on.","Jayson Bedford","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we do still have time for one more question. And that last question comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Jaffray. Please state your question.","Adam Maeder","Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter end, and thanks for taking the question. Just one for me maybe on Critical Care, that business continues to be a positive driven by HemoSphere. How should we be thinking about the growth trajectory over the longer term? Is this level of growth sustainable? And can you remind us of the benefit you're seeing from a capital standpoint?","Mike Mussallem","Well, we're really pleased with what's going on in Critical Care. And you can tell the growth rate that we've enjoyed this year, has been a step-up from what we've done in the past.","The HemoSphere all-in-one platform has really been important. And it has stimulated our growth rate. Having said that, that team in Critical Care continues to add features to HemoSphere and there are new features that will be added even later this year and some more in the future.","So as those happen, we think it provides a lift to growth. Although, I don't know that you're going to see the same bolus. So we're going to share our expectations a little bit more discreetly or clearly, when we get together at the investor conference. But right now, we continue to feel like, we have a strong franchise there in Critical Care.","Adam Maeder","That's very clear. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I'll now turn it back to management for closing remarks.","Mike Mussallem","Well. Just thanks for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, and Mark, and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. And I'll turn it back to you.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Erickson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Erickson, you may begin.","David K. Erickson","Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our fourth quarter 2013 financial results. During today's call, we'll discuss the results included in the press release and the accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A.

Mussallem","Thank you, David. I'm proud to say that our strong fourth quarter results helped us finish the year as it places Edwards Lifesciences in a strong position today than any time in our history. Although our initial sales expectations for 2013 were more optimistic, we ended the year with an underlying full year sales growth of 11% and non-GAAP diluted EPS growth of 16%.","Additionally, during 2013, we launched important new products, reported strong clinical data and made significant progress on several key development milestones that position us very well for sustainable future growth. Most importantly, even more patients are benefiting from our life-saving technologies than ever before.","Now turning to our quarterly results. Total underlying sales grew 10% to $550 million. This growth rate excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and the THV sales return reserve which Scott will explain in more detail later. We're pleased with our THV results across all geographies this quarter and our exiting 2013 with strong momentum.","Underlying global THV sales were above our expectations and grew 22% to $198 million driven by especially strong growth in Europe and the contributions we expected from SAPIEN in the U.S. Outside the U.S., underlying THV sales grew 28% driven once again by strong SAPIEN XT transfemoral unit growth in Europe.","TF growth continues to be aided by the competitive strength of our 29 millimeter system. Double-digit industry growth of transcatheter valve procedures in Europe even after six years of commercial availability validates our belief in the existence of a large group of untreated patients just now seeking treatment. We estimate the patent infringement rulings in Germany had a negligible impact on sales this quarter and we continue to see only a small impact from more recent competitors.","In our first quarter of launch, THV sales in Japan were $4 million. We're very pleased with how our rollout is progressing so far and continue to believe the opportunity there is attractive. While the hospital certification process is governing the speed of the launch, the favorable reimbursement, physician enthusiasm and very high procedural success rates support our optimism for the broad adoption of our SAPIEN XT technology. We continue to believe the TAVR opportunity in Japan will grow between $300 million and $400 million in 2019.","In the U.S., underlying THV sales were $93 million for the quarter which included net stocking sales of $2 million and clinical sales of $13 million. Clinical sales were strong once again this quarter, driven primarily by the rapid enrollment of the SAPIEN 3 high-risk arm of The PARTNER II Trial.","New commercial site training picked up in the fourth quarter and by the end of the year, 290 sites in the U.S. were offering SAPIEN to their patients. Estimated procedural growth exceeded 40% this quarter over last year. Recall that the fourth quarter last year included $16 million of net stocking sales that coincided with the FDA approval of SAPIEN for high-risk patients and transapical procedures.","We're gratified that heart teams have maintained their high procedural success rates since the launch in the U.S. two years ago. We continue to believe there are great many more patients on the sidelines that will pursue transcatheter technology and are continuing to build awareness for this important therapy. Likewise, we are focusing on ways to help hospitals optimize their TAVR programs by sharing best practices which can reduce lengths of stay and improve their economics.","I'm sure you saw the announcement of a competitor that was approved to treat inoperable patients in the U.S. The timing of this was consistent with the assumptions we discussed in December and we are well prepared to respond. We plan to rapidly upgrade customers to our SAPIEN XT valve once it's approved at prices comparable to what they're currently paying for SAPIEN.","Overall, we are committed to aggressively defend our leadership position and are confident that clinicians in the U.S. will prefer SAPIEN XT as they do in Europe where we are the market leader and have been gaining share since 2010.","In summary, we're pleased with our THV results across all geographies this quarter. For 2014, given the near-term uncertainty associated with the competitive dynamics, we are reiterating our 0% to 14% underlying sales growth guidance. We expect to refine this range as we gain further clarity. Overall, we exited 2013 very strong and believe we are well positioned for durable leadership in the growing TAVR space.","Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group, sales were up 8% on an underlying basis driven primarily by unit growth. This quarter's growth was strongest in the U.S. and Europe. Pricing remains steady globally with a modest increase in average selling price lifted by INTUITY, our rapid deployment valve.","In the U.S., surgical valves grew 11% this quarter. We believe there was increased growth in procedures overall and that we have regained share as customers returned after trying competitor products. In Europe, underlying sales grew 7% driven primarily by sales of our premium price INTUITY valve system.","To summarize, our surgical valve business in 2013 we are exiting with strong momentum and expect underlying sales growth in 2014 to be in the 4% to 7% range driven by additional traction in Europe of the INTUITY Elite and launches of new minimally invasive cardiac surgery products.","Now, turning to the Critical Care product group, total sales for the quarter grew 2% on an underlying basis. Growth was solid across most regions and product lines this quarter but was reduced by the impact of the China distributor inventory reductions and the ongoing exit of our ACCESS product line.","During the fourth quarter we were excited to obtain a CE Mark for ClearSight ahead of schedule. ClearSight is our integrated platform combining our noninvasive monitoring technology with our best-in-class EV1000 system. We think ClearSight will be a very attractive product for hospitals that are looking for a noninvasive technology to monitor their less critical patients. In 2014, we expect to build on our strong leadership position and deliver underlying sales growth of 3% to 6% aided by the launch of our new ClearSight product.","Before we get into the financials, I'd like to recap a few of the developments in our ongoing IP litigation. In the U.S. we announced last month a federal jury found that Medtronic willfully infringes one of our Cribier patents and awarded us $394 million in damages. We intend to ask the court to grant a permanent injunction. This patent is valid until the end of 2017.","Also in the U.S., we're still awaiting the court's decision related to the Andersen patent which also found Medtronic willfully infringes. We're seeking additional damages and a permanent injunction. Separately, we expect a decision by the U.S. Patent Office to be made in mid-2014 regarding the final patent term extension of this patent.","Edwards has invested significant resources developing products to help patients and we will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property. Although the enforcement of our IP represents potential upside for our company, we've not included any benefit from patent litigation or royalties in our guidance.","Now, I'm pleased to introduce to you Scott Ullem, our new Chief Financial Officer, who joined us last month. Scott replaces Tom Abate who is retiring from Edwards after many years of service and dedication to our company for which we are truly grateful. Scott?","Scott B. Ullem","Thank you, Mike. I'll start by saying that I'm pleased to have joined Edwards. I've had a chance to meet some of our investors already and I look forward to getting to know many of you at upcoming conferences. I also want to thank Tom Abate for helping me make a smooth transition.","Now I'll turn it to our financial results. This quarter, our sales performance in valves allowed us to achieve diluted earnings per share of $0.68 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.91 comparable to the fourth quarter of 2012, which benefited from large U.S. THV stocking orders.","Before I get into the details of the quarter, I wanted to elaborate on the sales return reserve that Mike referenced earlier. As we discussed during our Investor conference on December 9, as we launched SAPIEN 3 in Europe and SAPIEN XT in the U.S., we will exchange previously sold transcatheter heart valves to the more advanced technologies.","These planned product upgrades required us to record two reserves in the fourth quarter. First, a $14 million sales return reserve that reflects the value of the valves we already sold and will take back from customers. This reserve will reverse during 2014 as we ship the upgraded valves.","Second reserve is a small inventory reserve for returned product not expected to be resold. In order to compare our sales results on a consistent basis between periods, we are excluding the impact of the sales reserve both in this quarter and future quarters when the sales reserve reverses.","Now turning to the financials. For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 72.9% compared to 75.4% in the same period last year. The reduction was driven primarily by a reduced benefit from foreign exchange of approximately 130 basis points. The impact from the sales return reserve and higher manufacturing costs as we prepare for the SAPIEN XT launch in the U.S. and the SAPIEN 3 launch in Europe; these items were partially offset by a more profitable product mix. For 2014, we continue to expect our gross profit margin, excluding special items, to be approximately 73%.","Fourth quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $191 million, up 7% over the prior year, driven primarily by the U.S. medical device tax and Japan transcatheter valve launch-related expenses. This was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange translation principally because the yen depreciated more than 20% year-over-year. We expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 37% and 38% of sales for the full year 2014.","Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 5% to $79 million or 15% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in heart valve clinical studies. For the full year 2014, we continue to expect R&D as a percent of sales to be approximately 16%.","During the quarter, we recorded a $16 million pretax special charge comprised of two items; a global realignment charge of $10 million primarily related to severance expenses to improve Critical Care's operational efficiency. And second, a $6 million intangible asset write-off related to a prior acquisition.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $4 million. In the fourth quarter, Edwards issued $600 million, 2.875% coupon, five-year notes. We swapped 300 million of those notes to floating. For the full year 2014, we continue to expect net interest expense to be between $12 million and $15 million.","Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 25.3% or 23.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Assuming renewal of the federal research and development tax credit in the fourth quarter and excluding special items, we continue to expect our 2014 tax rate to be between 20% and 22%.","Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted fourth quarter sales by $13 million compared to the prior year, driven by the weakening of the yen. Compared to our recent guidance, FX rate negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.01. Looking forward at current rates, we continue to estimate $20 million negative impact to full year 2014 sales when compared to 2013 rates.","Free cash flow generated during the fourth quarter was $91 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $111 million plus capital spending of $20 million. Excluding the $57 million impact from the Medtronic receipt for initial IP damages, full year free cash flow is $306 million which is our strongest performance ever.","Turning to our balance sheet, at the end of the quarter we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $937 million. Total debt is $593 million.","Now turning to our 2014 guidance. Our financial guidance remains unchanged from our December Investor conference. For Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, we expect sales to be between $810 million and $850 million. In transcatheter heart valves, we expect sales to be between $700 and $820 million, excluding the impact of the sales return reserve. And in Critical Care, we expect sales of $535 million to $575 million.","We expect full year total sales of $2.05 billion to $2.25 billion and free cash flow excluding special items between $325 million and $425 million. Excluding special items, we expect diluted earnings per share to be a wide range around $3. Given our planned share repurchases during the first quarter of 2014, we expect full year diluted shares outstanding to be between 107 million and 109 million.","For the first quarter 2014, we project total sales of 500 million to 550 million, excluding the impact of the THV reserve and diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be between $0.61 and $0.71.","With that, I'll hand it back to Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks, Scott. Now, I'd like to provide an update on some of our product development programs. In transcatheter valves, we are continuing to actively work with the FDA to obtain approval of SAPIEN XT valve in the U.S. Consistent with our prior assumptions, we are anticipating approval over the next few months. Our SAPIEN XT which is currently the leading transcatheter valve in Europe will be a welcome upgrade for our U.S. physicians and patients and we anticipate a rapid adoption once it becomes available.","A few weeks ago you'll recall our announcement about the completion of the enrollment of the SAPIEN 3 trial for high risk and inoperable patients and the approvals to begin the study of 1,000 intermediate risk patients. The 500 patients in the high-risk arm were enrolled rapidly which demonstrates the enthusiasm clinicians have for our most advanced SAPIEN 3 valve and its smaller profile and a feature to address paravalvular leak.","Assuming a one-year follow-up and an uncomplicated FDA approval, we could expect U.S. approval by mid-2016. Enrollment of our 1,000 intermediate risk patients has already begun and we expect this study arm to enroll by the end of the year.","In Europe, we just received CE Mark for SAPIEN 3 and have commenced an aggressive launch with a number of successful implants already this year. Upgrading customers to this new platform should be fast as there is no need for extensive training and clinicians are very eager to get their hands on this exciting new technology. For these reasons, we believe SAPIEN 3 will quickly become the leading transcatheter valve in Europe.","We will soon be initiating enrollment in Europe of the next series of patients for our self-expanding CENTERA valve. CENTERA features a short, discrete frame, a novel motorized delivery system that allows for stable, precise deployment and is delivered through a 14-French eSheath. We continue to expect receipt of European approval in the mid-2015 timeframe.","Now, I'd like to provide an update on our Mitral Program. We continue to be excited about this significant opportunity that will be meaningful for patients, and believe that Edwards is well positioned, even as the path to commercialization may be long. We are disappointed that our first-in-human experience has not yet begun, as we are just now receiving the necessary regulatory approval to proceed. This has been the sole cause for the delay and we expect to begin shortly.","In our Surgical Valve product line, we're working closely with our notified body to gain CE Mark for our INTUITY Elite system and expect the approval soon. You will recall the increased reimbursement for our INTUITY valve is already in place in Germany.","During the Society of Thoracic Surgery meeting, data from the cadence trial demonstrated that INTUITY with an MIS approach significantly reduced cross clamp time and improved mean gradients when compared to a conventional open procedure. We continue to believe in INTUITY's potential for simpler procedures, fewer complications and faster recovery which supports our expectation for increased adoption of INTUITY in Europe in 2014.","In the U.S., enrollment in both our TRANSFORM trial for INTUITY and our COMMENCE trial studying the GLX tissue on aortic and mitral Magna Ease valves remain on track to be completed by the end of the year. GLX is our advanced tissue platform designed to enhance valve durability and enable pre-mounting of valves and delivery systems.","During the STS meeting, clinicians from the Cleveland Clinic presented a 30-year study of more than 12,000 patients who received our PERIMOUNT aortic valves representing over 81,000 patient years of follow-up. Of particular note were the durability outcomes showing a 98% freedom from explant for structural valve failure at 10 years and an 85% freedom of explant for structural failure at the end of 20 years.","Together with the two 25-year PERIMOUNT study presented in 2013, these data strengthening the differentiated body of scientific evidence demonstrating unmatched durability of the PERIMOUNT platform. Lastly, we continue to expect the introduction in 2014 of several minimally invasive enabling tools in our CSS product portfolio.","Finally, in our Critical Care product line, interest in noninvasive advancing monitoring remains high as clinicians apply this novel technology to surgical patients. We're just beginning our launch of ClearSight in Europe and continue to expect the U.S. launch in the third quarter of this year.","We're encouraged by the progress we're making with GlucoClear and the significant need for glycemic monitoring in the hospital setting. We're just now expanding our evaluations in Europe. Ultimately, the key to driving customer adoption will be the publication of outcomes and accuracy studies. These data will also help and form the pathway toward a U.S. approval.","So, in conclusion, we have a number of exciting products positioned to contribute to growth in 2014 and as we look beyond 2014, we like how we're positioned. Edwards is fortunate to have strong leadership and attractive markets with sustainable growth potential and a robust product pipeline which should enable us to strengthen our position even further and impact the care of more patients around the world. Combined with upside opportunities such as successful mitral therapies, glucose monitoring and patent enforcement, we believe that Edwards' future is very bright.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to David.","David K. Erickson","Thank you, Mike. In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that you please limit the number of questions. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and we'll answer as many of these as we can during the remainder of the hour.","Operator, we're ready for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting our question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is coming from the line of Mr. Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies","Hi. Good afternoon. I wonder if I could ask \u2013 several things to ask. Maybe I can just start with the number of centers in the United States in the quarter, I think you noted it was 290 which was a nice tick up, and I'm curious if you have any thoughts around what's behind that, whether it's the availability of SAPIEN 3 in clinical trialing or perhaps hospitals getting more comfortable with profitability, maybe any thoughts should be helpful.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Raj. Good question. I think it's just more of the same. There is continued interest on the part of hospitals; they've been wanting to get involved. They've all been looking very hard at how they can comply with the NCD and I think a number of them have just found a way to clear the hurdles. That's the primary driver.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies","Okay. And maybe just for my follow-up, I know it's still very early days but Medtronic is now approved and coming here in the U.S. Any initial views on what they're doing in the marketplace? Have you seen anything yet ruining [ph] appetites there for you?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, there's not much to report at this point, Raj. I can't say that we have really felt the presence very much at this point, so we are very fortunate that we have this first-mover advantage and we like the clinical preference that we think is going to be there. And so we're feeling pretty good at this point. We're certainly ready for them.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies","All right, good. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to just come back to the return reversal question and make sure I fully understand what numbers you intend to report over the course of this year. So, as I look at the first quarter, the $500 million to $550 million number, can you give us some sense as to what the return reversal impact is going to be in Q1 and what number you actually expect to show up in street models?","Scott B. Ullem","Sure. Eventually all of the return reserve will be reversed. And I can't predict how much of that will happen in the first quarter versus in quarters beyond, but all of it will be reversed as products are exchanged.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, isn't it fair to say, Scott, that in that estimate we really have taken the reserves out of it? That's our estimate of what's going to actually happen and so you'll see that in our non-GAAP results, right, and that's what our guidance was about.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","I'm sorry, I can take this offline later, but are going to be reporting non-GAAP revenue numbers for the fourth quarter \u2013 if I look at the gross profit, for example, the 72.9% that's calculated off of $550 million number or $536 million number?","Scott B. Ullem","Well, the 72.9% is calculated off of $536 million. We're going to be reporting GAAP and non-GAAP sales as we do for any special item in the first quarter and beyond.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay. I got it. And then maybe just a strategic question for you, Mike, as you sort of thought about the list of upside drivers that are not factored into your guidance, I think you said litigation, mitral, and glucose monitoring; all three which seem very far out, can you maybe just talk about how you see 2014 unfolding and what factors we can watch for to give clarity on a better outer year growth profile than what you're presenting for this year?","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure. We probably have some upsides that could show up in 2014. It could have to do with product approvals. There could be just continued data that continues to be presented from Edwards that's stronger than our competitors. But you're right in your observation that many of the upsides that I shared will occur possibly outside of 2014. In 2014, I think one of the things that will be most interesting is \u2013 and there's a little list here. One, within transcatheter heart valve, just how do we stack up competitively in Europe and in the U.S. So how does Edwards do with SAPIEN 3 versus the new competitors that are going to show up in the U.S.? How does Edwards do especially with SAPIEN XT versus our first competitor after a couple of years? And then that very nice momentum in surgical heart valves, how well does that continue? We feel like some of the factors were dragging the growth rate at Critical Care should be behind us to lift that growth rate. So I think there's a number of indicators to watch.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, everybody. Mike, maybe you could talk a little bit more about the European launch of SAPIEN 3. You obviously expect considerable optimism, maybe a little more color or detail on the ramp. How quickly is it going to be available in the major centers? Is this a share gainer? Does it open new accounts? And maybe put that in perspective relative to the other product trials that are underway? Does it blunt the impact there? Just again, some of those details.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, we've got a pretty good supply out there and we're converting people right now. There's strong excitement and so people would like to go quickly. The features of this valve are something they find very attractive. In terms of will it be a share gain, in many accounts we are on the shelf with the competitor. So this is a chance for us actually for people to reach for SAPIEN 3 more often. So I think it does have an opportunity to have a share impact probably pretty early on here. We think it really is a best-in-class and we think once people try it that they're going to be excited about it. It's still early on, Rick, so it's tough to give you much than that but right now they're anxious to get their hands on it.","Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And it sounds like you're ready to supply. In the SAPIEN XT, I know it's always a difficult question but you said, 'expect approval in the next few months.' And I'm sorry to look for meaning where there may be some or none, but are you feeling more optimistic today versus your comments in the December approval \u2013 in the next few months feels more optimistic to me but maybe I'm looking for something that isn't there?","Michael A. Mussallem","I think it's similar, Rick. I mean we're just two months out from where we were before, so obviously here we are two months closer saying pretty much the same thing from a timing perspective. So I guess that does express some level of confidence. But yes, we're still feeling pretty good about that. But it is a regulatory process, so we're never positive just when that will come.","Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, but it sounds like hopeful in second quarter.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, certainly.","Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Bruce Nudell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Bruce Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, when we think about the XT approval, should we be thinking about broad PARTNER I approval inclusive of inoperable and operable?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, we are hopeful that indeed when that approval comes we're working with FDA. We ask for both and we're hopeful that that's the way that it comes out. We think certainly that the data supports that, but we can't be sure.","Bruce Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","And then one of the upstart competitors today announced the successful first in man in mitral. Could you just briefly explain the circumstances around your timing and maybe you also alluded in the fact that it's a long-term opportunity where commercial sales won't arise in the near term. Around what timeframe might we see successful commercialization of product?","Michael A. Mussallem","Well, as I said earlier, we expect to begin shortly. Our compliments to them if they really do have some early success here. We chose to do our first in human in places that have rigorous regulatory processes and we got some questions related to the preclinical data, but we believe we've answered all the questions and really do believe that we're going to begin shortly. So, we feel good about this. This is a big opportunity and we're anxious to get started to find out just exactly where we stand. I think the competitive landscape there is one that will unfold probably pretty deliberately over time. I think it's pretty tough to make a call where anybody is competitively at this stage of the game.","Bruce Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Thanks so much.","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Jason Mills - Canaccord Genuity","Thanks, Mike and Scott, for taking the question. First question is on your EPS guidance. Mike, what are the top two or three variables that you need more clarity on to narrow that range? And when do you expect that that clarity might come? Will it be on the first quarter call, do you think it will take half a year, maybe just a little more color there?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks, Jason. Probably the single biggest thing is going to be the approval of XT. Once we have clarity on the approval of XT in the U.S., that's probably the single outstanding variable. Second biggest to that is probably just \u2013 as we get more clarity on how our competitors are behaving and their launches in Europe and the U.S. and maybe we'll get a little bit more clarity than we have today. But the single biggest one will be that and I hope we have it under our belt by the time we get to the second quarter call. That will put us in a position to have a shot here and tighten things up.","Jason Mills - Canaccord Genuity","Okay, great. My follow-up again on transcatheter valves, sorry if I missed it Mike but did you give an ongoing procedural growth rate for you and for market in Europe, just trying to get a sense for what that's market doing with the next generation technology and sort of what you're expecting it do with SAPIEN 3, whether or not you expect to see an acceleration there? And then the U.S. follow-up on the first question, what's in your guidance \u2013 your THV guidance with respect to pricing if any changes is in there? Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Michael A. Mussallem","All right, Jason, I'm going to make sure that I answer your questions accurately here as we go through it. So, first of all in Europe, what we specifically reported on was our OUS results. So OUS sales grew 28% and that was driven by very strong transfemoral growth. If you peel it back, I would say Europe grew in the low teens for us in 2013. And so we're pretty pleased with that. Well, I think when we talked about it going into the year, we were expecting a market growth of around 10 and our own growth to be less than that because of competitive reasons and we certainly came out much stronger, some of this driven by the real momentum that we have in the fourth quarter. So that's broadly where that stands. I don't know if that answers your question. I expect there to be pretty good growth in 2014 as well. I don't know, I would hope that it might be in the 10% range. As it relates to pricing, we think our pricing has been pretty solid. We have noted in the past that we had an ASP decline, was probably in the 3% range, probably driven mostly by the volume discounting we do. With the advent of SAPIEN 3 we expect to be able to introduce those products at the same price as SAPIEN XT. So, I think you should think that pricing is going to stay pretty stable in 2014.","Jason Mills - Canaccord Genuity","Thanks, Mike.","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Swann. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC","Thanks so much. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a quick question on valve sizing, I understand with SAPIEN XT you'll get I believe it's the 29 millimeter valves. That helps fill out the sizing, makes you more competitive with CoreValve. How much does that increase the addressable market from a patient perspective in your view? And then how much of the market will you still not be able to address versus your competitor, CoreValve?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, the 29 millimeter valves in our view is very meaningful. I think if you think back to the days when we first introduced it in Europe, we saw a real uptick. We got it first in the transapical position then transfemoral and that ticked off. And then we \u2013 it feels like a lot of the share that we're gaining in Europe right now is in the 29 millimeter sizes. It seems to stack up pretty well competitively. So, I don't know exactly what that percentage is. It probably is in the sort of \u2013 I don't know, plus 20% probably in the 29. But I'd say the majority of patients get covered between 23 to 29, we'd estimate that close to 95% of the patients are addressed.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC","Okay, got it. And Mike not to harp on mitral, but you've given a little bit of color in the past when we come to visit you on how you guys are thinking about the mitral timeline as far as getting from first in man to commercialization. Are you still thinking that despite the delay, it's possible to tighten up that timeline versus what we saw with first generation SAPIEN here in the U.S. or is the sort of 7 to 10-year timeline sort of what we should be thinking about?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, Danielle, I don't know how to sort of explain this more clearly. We're really excited about mitral. It's a really big opportunity. We're beautifully positioned but it is really hard to put timelines on it at this stage of the game. We really don't have our first in human experience underneath our belt. And until we see what that looks like, we're just not going to know what kind of timeline. You could think optimistically that if everything is perfect then you just keep going right to CE Mark, but you very easily could be in a redesign as well and we just don't know the answers to those questions yet. So, I think it's premature, Danielle, to dial in too many specific sales here in the near future.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC","Okay, got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Brooks West - Piper Jaffray","Thanks for taking the question. Mike, can you remind us what your ASPs are for SAPIEN 3 in the clinical setting in the U.S.? So in another way, if you're going to do 1,000 patients this year, what should we look at for U.S. clinical revenues?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I think in most of our contracts where we price our clinical units around $25,000, Brooks, if that helps.","Brooks West - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Perfect. And then one on Japan, you did 4 million you said in Q4 maybe being slowed down by the certification process. I think Larry said at the analyst meeting that you would do 40 to 50 next year in Japan. Does that still seem achievable and then does that become pretty backend loaded?","Michael A. Mussallem","You know what, it feels to us that Japan is right on track, just exactly what we expected. As I noted, there is this certification requirement so we're thinking right now that we're going to get limited to adding four accounts per month. So from that perspective, yes, it's backend loaded. But we feel good about the $40 million to $50 million range. That range is tracking at least with the experience we have so far which is I guess four months under our belt. It looks like it's just stacking up just the way we thought it would.","Brooks West - Piper Jaffray","Great. Thanks, Mike. Welcome onboard, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Let me start, Mike, with comments you made earlier about clinical data that may help differentiate you from the competition in 2014. Can you talk about that a little bit? And specifically we were intrigued to see this head-to-head study called the CHOICE study from Germany being presented as a link breaker at ACC. Was that what you were referring to? Do you think that study has taken off to impact share? And I had one follow-up. Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem","We continue to be surprised with the data that's being collected out there. There are country registries that are going on. This study that you referenced coming out of Germany that's going to be presented at the ACC is one that's going to be interesting and we don't know the results of that. And there's also quite a bit of data that's being presented now in the surgical space. Some good stuff for us and some things that aren't necessarily complementary for some other valves of our competitors. So broadly we think we're on pretty solid ground here and like to think that the more that our products are studied, the more that \u2013 the best of Edwards is going to show. But I wasn't trying to refer just to that study in Germany at the ACC, because we really don't know the outcome but we're optimistic about it.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Mike, I just wanted to ask my follow-up question on the U.S. TAVI market. If we look at your sales excluding stock in the last three quarters, it's been in the $88 million to $91 million range. It's been flattish if I'm doing the math right. And so if we take stocking out, you did about 345 million in the U.S. this year. Why do you think it's been flattish sequentially the last three quarters? And what are you looking for in 2014 at this point for the U.S. market, ex-stocking? You can put clinical in because I think that it's probably valid but help us think about the market growth for the U.S. in 2014 including CoreValve? And I'll drop. Thanks.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, just a couple of things. One is, the fourth quarter was pretty consistent with what we thought it was going to come out to be. I think when we provided our guidance, we said it was going to be at the low end of the range that bottomed to 350 and pretty much came out that way. Some of it probably just has to do with the limitations of SAPIEN. This is a pretty big valve, Larry. It's a 24 French system that we think as you have systems that are earlier to handle, it's going to be better for patients and better for clinicians and we think that will certainly help. There was more to your question, I'm sorry\u2026","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Yes, expectations for market growth in 2015. On an apples-to-apples basis if you want to just include clinical, strip out stocking, whatever you feel is most helpful to give us some direction\u2026?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, we at the investor conference, we estimated that the global growth in 2014 for THV would be in the 20% to 30% range. We didn't give an estimate for the U.S. and I think that just reflects some of the uncertainty associated with these approvals. But I do think that as systems that can go through an 18 French Introducer come out there that it's going to help the growth rate in the U.S. market.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Ben Andrew with William Blair. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Good afternoon, Mike. May be just a quick question about the efforts to go back and work with clinics to improve their economics. Have you seen any traction in a subgroup of clinics yet, and how do you expect that to play out through the course of the year? And what impact does that have on your range of guidance?","Michael A. Mussallem","Thanks, Ben. We're optimistic about this one. We have seen improvements. We think there are sites right now and the biggest improvements that we know are in their lengths of stay. They've gotten in many cases motivated about this. They're talking about it. They're sharing best practices and they're moving the needle. I wouldn't be surprised to see more and more presentations in the future about how people are reacting. We hear about things anecdotally that are pretty impressive. And so we like the things the way things are moving right now, Ben. There's substantial movement from a year ago today.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Okay. And then changing gears quickly, on the request for an injunction in the U.S., given kind of the domestic focus on patient access or patient harm potentially and the design differences, I know you're not going to characterize the percent as odds of this but is it actually likely that you can get an injunction from the courts in the United States like in Germany?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, it's a good question, Ben. One of the things that I think any judge would worry about is whether somehow patients were going to be denied therapy because of implementing an injunction. And one of the things that we would do is to certainly consider having appropriate carve-outs that protect patients, so that no patient is ever in a position where they have to worry about getting therapy because an Edwards' product doesn't suit their needs. And we think if we take that kind of a stance it only makes it a little easier for the judge here to draw a conclusion that an injunction is appropriate.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem","But I'll also say that if something like that were to happen, it's certainly an upside and it's not in our plans today.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go back to the reserve adjustments, just understanding how you guys are presenting it through the non-GAAP figures. Mike, I think you had mentioned just for transcatheter valve 93 million in the U.S., is that excluding the reserve? Maybe you can just give us what the reserve breakdown in terms of U.S. and OUS? I'm assuming you guys are adding that back to the sales line and then adding it back I guess to cost of goods? I'm just a little confused on the accounting there.","Scott B. Ullem","Sure. It was a $14 million reserve roughly split between the U.S. and Europe.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. So, Michael, the U.S. sales of 93 million were adding back roughly I guess 7 million to the reported GAAP results of a sales basis?","Michael A. Mussallem","So I think 93 excludes the reserve, Kristen. So it doesn't count that.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. And then what specifically I guess was written off, you had mentioned there was in process R&D charge that was excluded out as well. So I guess what does that relate to?","Michael A. Mussallem","There was an investment \u2013 actually some of you may recall, it goes back to Embrella. We took a slight impairment associated with that purchase that we did. I don't know that must be two years ago now.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. Is that written-off because you guys are not pursuing that technology or it's just not going to come at the maybe sales contribution that you thought before?","Michael A. Mussallem","I think our belief is that it's a smaller opportunity than was in our original business model and that causes us to modify its value.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. And then last question, any I guess change and thoughts just about cash usage. I know you guys have the share repurchase program outstanding, but any thoughts just on the share considering a dividend or just acquisitions to maybe diversify the sales profile?","Scott B. Ullem","Kristen, really no change in priorities for cash at this point.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one follow-up on mitral, just wanted to confirm the first in man is still going to be a transapical. And if so, can you give us any update on a transfemoral approach?","Michael A. Mussallem","You're right, Glenn. There is no change in what we said at our investor conference. It's the device we talked about and yes, it's a transapical delivery system. It's still large bore. Yes, our longer term plans are certainly to want to move this to a transfemoral which would mean transseptal delivery but there is some work to do and we really want to have our first in man experience before we can really give you more specifics on that one. But that would really help unlock the long-term potential. But it's kind of premature right now. We just want to right now have a successful experience and be able to look back after 30 days and say that we've got a valve that's functioning the way it needs to.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","And then a follow-up, you didn't give us the timeline for PARTNER 2a. I think the last patient came in last summer, two years of follow-up. So do we see those results toward the end of 2015?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I'm trying to recreate it here. I think P2a \u2013 remember that has a two-year endpoint, so \u2013 let's see. I don't know, David, do you recall when we \u2013 it was September, October. Then you've got two years following that, Glenn. Does that answer your question\u2026?","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Yes, I'm assuming there we get that data TCT or AHA of 2015 toward the end of 2015. Is that reasonable?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. You know what, I didn't do the math on that one but I can get back to you on that. But yes, it usually takes us \u2013 once we actually hit that two-year endpoint, it usually takes us a good quarter, maybe a little more before we can put the data together and have it ready for publishing and have it out there.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thank you. Mike, I think the last patient follow was early October. So I would assume ACC at '16. Let me make sure I'm clear on the reversal for the reserve. Having covered stent companies for years, we've seen reversals before. But I don't think we've seen a company reverse the bottom-line impact. So I just want to make sure I understand how you're going to be treating that going forward. So we see a negative impact from these reversals on EPS where your GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments over the course of this year being negative relative to the positive adjustment that occurred in the fourth quarter?","Scott B. Ullem","Sure. Mike, it's Scott. Most of the impact of the reversal comes at the gross profit line and the operating profit line and it all flows right down to that $0.10 a share in diluted EPS.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yes, I understand that. So you credited the 2013 P&L with $0.10 for product that you sold but didn't implant. And so as you go back with new product that you're going to sell again, and then you're going to do what on the EPS line? So what's the bridge going to be from GAAP to non-GAAP in '14 since you just added back that $0.10 in '13?","Scott B. Ullem","We're going to pull it out in both years. Our intention is to reflect the impact of what the business would look like if we didn't have the swap and what the impact of the business looks like with the swap.","Michael A. Mussallem","This is Mike. It's always risky when I get in here and answer financial questions, but what was sold in the fourth quarter is really what was sold. And it's typical sales. What the accounting convention we understand is if you believe that there is going to be this sort of exchange in the future, you pull it out of today's sales. And then when that actually goes back and you put it back in, but that would just confuse our presentation of results. And so that's why we're going to end up showing this both ways here. We're going to pull this exchange out and show you what it is discretely both this year when we're taking the downer and next year when it comes back and it's the upper, we'll also take it out.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. So you'll take the EPS contribution from '13 out of '14, if we're all supposed to be using non-GAAP numbers here?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, top to bottom, Mike, it all comes out.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. And then one question; the first quarter guidance, how do you get to the lower half of that range? It would seem if the roughly $3 is the guidance for '14, obviously recognizing that's a very much a ballpark figure, it would seem that guiding from down 2% to down 16% in EPS, the down 16% type number would seem to be extreme given that the first quarter the competitor launching. So how do you get to \u2013 how would you get to the lower half of that range in the first quarter?","Michael A. Mussallem","I don't know. Mike, there's a wide range. What we've tried to do is to represent what we think the full range of possibilities are and this is sort of I suppose the bottom of the range is just a lot of things go wrong and top of the range, so a lot of things go right. I mean I'm not going to lay out detail specifics on that, but at this stage when there was the uncertainty associated when Edwards is going to be approved and the uncertainty of exactly how the rest of the questions about the rollout of competitor products exists, we thought it was best to give you what our feeling was as a realistic wide range.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good afternoon. It's Steve Beuchaw here for David. First of all, Scott, welcome to the call.","Scott B. Ullem","Thanks, Steve.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Two quick ones. One is on SAPIEN 3, the full CE Mark study data, could you give us a sense of when we might expect to see that data and is it safe to say that expectations for best-in-class leak data, low stroke appropriate there?","Michael A. Mussallem","Well, in terms of when it's going to be available, we say most likely at PCR. That would be our estimate although again these clinicians tend to operate pretty independently. We can't speculate exactly what it's going to say but the enthusiasm's been high and we're thinking that the results are going to look pretty positive based on what we've seen in the very early data?","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Got it. And then one on the U.S. market, Mike, in your comments thinking back to TCT and the analyst day, you sounded very comfortable with a view that pricing in the U.S. would be, let's call it, disciplined. Is there any higher or lower level of comfort that you're feeling now that you've seen the competition on the market in the U.S. as it relates to where pricing trends?","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes. Thanks, Steve. It's going to be interesting for us. We just take what we've heard externally. The same maybe that you've heard is that we don't expect there to be a dramatic change in the pricing of our competitors what we really don't know. We're not anticipating that there's going to be a big change in pricing. Remember, there was a very large investment on the part of anybody to get to the U.S. market. This would only be the second competitor in the U.S. market and there's nobody on the near horizon that would be coming to the market. So, I don't know if there's a lot of incentive to change pricing dramatically.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Thanks, very helpful. Have a great afternoon.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints we'll be only able to take one final question. Our final questioner will be Bob Hopkins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. So just two quick ones. First of all, Mike, in your prepared comments you talked a lot about how ready the organization is for the CoreValve launch. And I was wondering if you could add any color to that in terms of how do you defend against CoreValve? What is the strategy? Any details you'd be willing to provide there would be helpful.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, thanks very much, Bob. I'm not sure that I want to go into detailed tactical approach but other than say that we think the body of evidence that's around SAPIEN and especially SAPIEN XT provides a tremendous foundation for which we can compete. And when you combine that with our willingness to upgrade people from SAPIEN to SAPIEN XT in a pretty painless and rapid fashion, we think it puts us in a position to be very strong defensively. As you know from our P&L, we were continuing our spending rate in terms of our sales and marketing resources in the U.S. We haven't pulled back on that at all. And simply the fact that we have a full mover advantage in that we've been in the marketplace for a couple of years, we like to think we've treated our customers with a lot of respect and a lot of care, we think that is only helpful at a time like this when they're going to have a choice.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. I understand the rationale for not disclosing too much there, but just curious if you wanted to add anything. And then the second question was on the European market for TAVR, and just if you could provide a little bit more color on why you think it did better than you originally anticipated? And are there any read-throughs there for the U.S. market long-term? Just trying to understand why the better growth in Europe.","Michael A. Mussallem","Yes, I mean it was very encouraging from our point of view. I'm not sure that we really saw it. There were a couple of things that I thought were noteworthy. One is that we saw it \u2013 we've typically seen Germany grow nicely and that continues to be a nice part of our growth, but we watched France and Italy and the UK all put up improved growth numbers. And so that was meaningful to us. From a share perspective, we performed very well in transfemoral units. I mean this was very strong growth. And again, it seems that the 29 millimeter XT is continuing to be a very popular product with customers. So I guess that's all I'd really add. Southern Europe was gone from being drag to growing again. May be that's part of it as well, Bob.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's helpful color. Thanks so much.","Michael A. Mussallem","Sure. Okay. Well, thank you all for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, David and I welcome any additional questions by telephone.","So with that, back to you David.","David K. Erickson","Thank you for joining us on today's call.
