Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.","Kevin Kalicak","Thank you, Ray. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's CEO and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of those measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings on September 26th before the market opens followed by a conference call.","This morning Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights, Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from both the fourth quarter and the full year before providing our outlook for fiscal 2018. And Gene will have some closing remarks before we open the call for your questions. During today's call, references to Darden same restaurant sales for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 do not include Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thanks, Kevin and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.93 billion, an increase of 8.1%. Same restaurant sales grew 3.3%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden by 480 basis points. Adjusted operating income grew 10% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.18, an increase of 7.3% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share.","The momentum we experienced as a result of our back to basics operating philosophy. Our focus on food, service and atmosphere drives our simplification efforts. These efforts continue to enable us to improve execution on our restaurants and strengthen team member engagement, as evidenced by our industry leading retention rates. The fact that our guest satisfaction scores are at all time highs, while we are growing guest count is a clear indication that we're improving operationally.","Olive Garden momentum continued during the quarter. Same restaurant sales grew 4.4%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden by 590 basis points. This was Olive Garden's 11th consecutive quarter same restaurant sales growth, driven by our focus on flawless execution, which lead to all-time high guest satisfaction scores, compelling promotional offers like our giant stuffed pastas that resonated with our guests and our strong To Go performance which grew 16%. The numerous investments the Olive Garden team has made over time, such as our remodels and bar refreshes, new kitchen equipment and the technology platform behind Olive Garden To Go, continues to pay off. The team is making meaningful strategic decisions where both our guests and our team members win.","Longhorn Steakhouse's same restaurant sales grew 3.5%, the 17th consecutive quarter of growth outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden by 500 basis points. We are seeing the brand's long term strategy to begin to pay off. The team continues to focus on improving the quality of the guest experience by investing in food quality and service execution, simplifying operations, and leveraging our unique culture to increase team member engagement. These efforts drove increased guest count of 2.1% during the quarter, and our guest feedback has never been better.","Turning to Cheddar's, we closed the acquisition on April 24th, and same restaurant sales were up 1.3% for the five weeks that we owned the brand. I continue to be impressed with Ian Baines and his team. They're focused on the right things to drive the business. We are well underway integrating Cheddar's into the Darden platform so they can benefit from our competitive advantages, while ensuring the restaurant teams maintain their high levels of in-restaurant execution. Although, it's a complicated process, everything is progressing as planned. The integration includes bringing Cheddar's on to a proprietary POS system, which is the backbone of our platform, and that will take approximately a year to complete.","Once this foundational element is finished, we will be able to introduce our productivity tools, which we expect to have further improved performance. Cheddar's is an exciting addition to our portfolio, which we believe will add significant value to Darden over the long-term.","Now, I'll turn it over to Rick.","Rick Cardenas","Thanks, Gene, and good morning everyone. As Gene mentioned, total sales for the fourth quarter increased 1.8%. This included $63 million in sales from five weeks of Cheddar's operations. Fourth quarter reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.99 and were negatively impacted by $0.19 related to a non-cash accounting charge of $0.10 from the early settlement of a portion of our pension plan commitments, and $0.09 of Cheddar's transaction and integration expenses.","After adjusting for these items, earnings per share growth was 7.3% to $1.18, driven by strong same restaurant sales growth of 3.3% and an additional $0.01 contribution from Cheddar's operating results. We also paid-out over $70 million in dividends and repurchased approximately $15 million in stock this quarter.","Looking at the P&L, food and beverage was favorable at 10 basis points with commodities inflation essentially flat this quarter. Restaurant labor was unfavorable 10 basis points as continued wage pressures slightly offset productivity gains. Restaurant expense was unfavorable 20 basis points due to incremental pre-opening expense related to seven more new restaurants opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.","Sales leverage, primarily at Olive Garden, resulted in marketing expenses being favorable to last year by 20 basis points. And G&A was unfavorable 10 basis points to last year due to greater incentive compensation expense as a result of our strong fourth quarter performance. This all resulted in EBIT margin expansion of 10 basis points above last year, and adjusted absolute EBIT dollar growth of 9.9%. Our 23.3% effective tax rate in the quarter was 270 basis points higher than last year's rate, which was aided by one-time tax benefit. This difference in effective rate along with incremental interest from our new debt issuance resulted in adjusted EBIT growth key growth of 5.8%.","Turning to our operating segments, Olive Garden, LongHorn, and Fine Dining, all posted segment profit margin expansion versus last year. While segment profit margin for the other business was 150 basis points below last year due to incremental preopening costs for three more openings in last year, temporary closures at Seasons 52 and Yard House and the addition of Cheddar's to the segment, altering the segment profit margin mix. Fiscal 2017 marked another great year of progress as our brands continued leveraging the power of Darden's competitive advantages. Total sales grew -3.4% to approximately $7.2 billion. Same restaurant sales growth of 1.8% exceeded the industry by over 400 basis points. All segments posted positive segment profit margin growth after adjusting for the impact of increased rent from the real-estate transaction.","Adjusted diluted net earnings per share grew 14%, and we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders in the form of approximately $280 million in dividends and $230 million in share repurchases at an average price of approximately $63 per share. Our average diluted share count for the year was 126 million, and we ended the year with approximately 126.9 million diluted shares outstanding.","In addition to meaningful sales and earnings growth at our legacy brands, we further increased our scale with the Cheddar's acquisition. Cheddar's has broad guest appeal and is ranked number one in value and casual dining. In addition to being number one in value, Cheddar's also ranks first in both food and beverage and atmosphere ratings, leading to the highest intent to return and intent-to-recommend ratings in casual dining. Cheddar's is a strong performer with same restaurant sales for full 2017 Darden's fiscal calendar of positive 0.3%, outperforming the industry by over 300 basis points. Restaurant sales volumes averaged $4.5 million and the average of the top and bottom quartile , each are within plus or minus 25% of this $4.5 million.","Average restaurant level EBITDA of 17% is compelling and essentially all restaurants have positive cash flows. With over $600 million in sales, $70 million in EBITDA and given their current footprint, Cheddar's will make a significant contribution to Darden's growth. As we further progress with the integration of Cheddar's, we have gained more confidence in our initial synergy estimates. We now expect run rate synergies of $22 million to $27 million to be fully realized by the end of fiscal 2019, up from the $20 million to $25 million we previously indicated. We\u2019ve included a couple of additional slides at the back of this presentation, providing supplemental information regarding Cheddar's.","Turning to fiscal 2018, as we announced last quarter, we will discontinue disclosing our monthly same restaurant sales results beginning with our next earnings release. This change is due to the significant variability in month-to-month sales results due to weather, promotional calendar and holiday shifts among other things that generally result throughout the quarter.","In fiscal 2018, we anticipate total sales growth of 11.5% to 13%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of between 1% and 2%, 35 to 40 new restaurants; including Cheddar's with roughly one-third opening in the first half of the year and the remaining two-thirds in the back half, and the full year impact of Cheddar's sales. We also continue to expect approximately $0.12 of accretion related to Cheddar's; capital spending between $400 million and $450 million, including Cheddar's; total inflation of approximately 2% comprised of between 0% and 1% commodities inflation and between 3% and 4% of total labor inflation; and annual effective tax rate of roughly 26% and approximately 127 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year; all resulting in adjusted diluted net earnings per share of between $4.38 and $4.50.","This morning, we also announced that our Board approved a 12.5% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $0.63 per share, which results in a dividend yield of 2.9% based on fiscal 2018\u2019s beginning share price. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gene for some closing remarks.","Gene Lee","Thanks, Rick. Looking back at fiscal 2017, I am proud of the progress we\u2019ve made to achieve our mission, which is to be financially successful through great people consistently delivering outstanding food, drinks and service and inviting atmosphere making every guest loyal. Our results demonstrate that the execution of our strategy is working. We continue to build guest loyalty and take market share by executing against our back to basics operating philosophy. And we continue to strengthen and leverage Darden's core competitive advantages to enable sales growth and expand margins across the portfolio.","Ultimately, it's more than 175,000 team members who bring to life our strategy and fulfill our mission. The teams in our restaurants and our restaurant support center are engaged and focused on the right priorities, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished this past year. And so I want to close by saying thank you to all of them, especially our newest team members from Cheddar's. We recognize there's more work to be done, but I'm confident that we have the right people in place and we will continue to win by building loyalty, one restaurant, one ship, one guest at a time.","And with that, we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim. Sir, your line is open.","Matthew DiFrisco","My question is with respect to OG to go and the delivery business, in general, for your portfolio. I guess, how do you see the building of it now as we get into -- we're cycling some of the bigger growth rates from the year ago. Does it continue to expand its reach, and is delivery something now that is going to propel the off-premise sales further? And then I don't know if you gave it. But can you just tell us what percent does Cheddar's do and how much of an opportunity given its strong value proposition would off-premise sales be also or the meal at home occasion similar to what you've executed with Olive Garden? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Good morning Matt, that's a lot of question in there. Let me just answer the Cheddar's, I'm going to go backwards. And Cheddar's is about 4% to 5% takeout. It's something that, again I think that the consumer's demanding. And so therefore, we're going to use some of our learnings from Olive Garden and pass that along to that management team, and hopefully that will be a driver of that business going into the future. Let's go to Olive Garden, takeout remains strong; we got a three year comp of about 58%; we're about 12.5% of total sales; the consumer's still demanding convenience. And if you step back and say okay where do we make the strategic choice, it was three or four years ago, let's say, we were going to bet on the consumer wanting more convenience in their dining experiences, and we built a strategy to go after that.","I don't believe that if a consumer is going to back off at all, and the consumer's going to continue to demand this from us. And we'll continue to meet them, meet that demand, and I foresee growth continuing. We think the upside still is in our catering, our large party delivery. I'm not going to get into specifics about that, but we believe that we've got a product that is differentiated compared to our competitive set, and we think there's some big upside growth there. Lastly, on the third party delivery, just as we were last quarter, we're in test with multiple purveyors delivering our product. We're trying to see how this whole thing plays out, but I think that the majority of our focus in Olive Garden is still large party delivery and large party takeout. I would think that's where our competitive advantage is.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner","Rick, first question is for you, just on the EPS guidance for 2018. Are you assuming any of the $22 million to $27 million of synergies -- close at all into '18, or are we going to assume that all goes into \u201819?","Rick Cardenas","We assume low-single-digit millions is going to flow into '18 and the rest of it will be in '19.","Brian Bittner","And then Gene just on the restaurant traffic, I mean your brands have been outperforming the industry nicely for a while, but the inflection in your own traffic this quarter was really interesting to see in the release. Can you just put a little more color to what you think actually drove that upswing in traffic, both at Olive Garden and LongHorn?","Gene Lee","Well, I think there is couple of things. Let's not forget that we\u2019ve had a later Easter this year. We did have a calendar benefit in the quarter, difficult for us to quantify because this isn't like holiday moving from one week to the other. So we did have some benefit with the calendar, but I believe the real driver of this is the strategic choices that we continue to make. We continued underpriced inflation, which results in underpricing our competitors. And I believe that we're now at three years into improving our operations every single-day.","Don\u2019t underestimate how simplifying our business has helped us improve execution. When we look at both Olive Garden and LongHorn where they were three years ago operationally to where we are today, these businesses are much simpler on a trajectory to continue to get even more simpler and we believe that's the key to our guest count growth is better execution through simplicity.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Ma'am, your line is open.","Sara Senator","Just a couple of questions about the top line, please. The first is just on the comp guidance, 1% to 2% when you look at what you did this year above that, and kind of the momentum you are bringing into the start of the year. Just curious if that's -- if it mean that using that guidance reflects just kind of the long-term view. What the portfolio should comp or if there is something else to it in terms of your outlook, and then I guess the second question on this top line. When I look at your core brands as I think of them, Olive Garden and LongHorn, they certainly seem to be outperforming the rest of the portfolio; and so including Cheddar's, although it might have had an impact from the transition, but I guess I was just curious do you still see or can you still articulate the rationale for portfolio. And do you think that when you look at Cheddar's, is there an opportunity to accelerate that top line maybe a little more detail than what you\u2019re able to give us last quarter? Thanks.","Gene Lee","Let me start with the first question. I think when I think about our comp guidance and we\u2019re forecasting into the future and pretty far out in the future, at this point in time and what gives you yearly number. And there are just a lot of unknowns. Our plan is to under price inflation again with the goal of increasing market share. So we\u2019re going to rely less on check average to get same restaurant sales growth. And so when we look that far out, we're thinking 1% to 2% is a good place to start. It has nothing to do with how we feel about our current trends. We\u2019re just trying to forecast out for 12 months. So we feel that\u2019s a prudent guidance at this point in time with everything that we know. And as we get closer towards the end of the year, as we have in the past, we\u2019ll continue to update that guidance.","As far as the portfolio and rest of our brands, couple of comments later Easter hurts fine dining and so capital grow was impacted by that. When I look at- - I look at their rest of our brands, the returns on invested capital, the profit margins in those brands are really strong. If we try to measure every brand up against Olive Garden from a return standpoint that\u2019s just not possible, I mean Olive Garden is a once in a lifetime restaurant brand. I look at our performance throughout the quarter. Yard House was $8.3 million or $8.3 million average unit volumes, same restaurant sales are going to continue -- always going to be hard to get as we continue to add new units and build that out. It's an incredible brand we want own that.","Bahama Breeze has had seven years of same restaurant sales growth, 1.4% in the quarter. Bahama Breeze would start significantly as some other competitors were with the weather in the north east and loosing -- we lose a lot of our debt capacity, which in some of our restaurants in north east is 30% capacity. And so I also think when we look at how we think about this and we look at our advantages of scale and gotten insides. These brands can add to that and they\u2019re getting incredible leverage of the Darden platform.","These are great brands and they provide us a lot of growth and lot of opportunities. As far as accelerating Cheddar's growth, I think it's -- what we\u2019ll have to wait and see and understand is; we\u2019re their human resource capabilities; we\u2019ll be able to trying sites for them, it's just a matter of when do they have the human resources to be able to ramp up growth; and we need to really spend the next 12 to 18 months focusing on integration. This is our fourth one. We understand the importance of getting the integration correct and then try to grow once we have done that.","So our focus here in the next 18 months is to get this integration completed correctly and build human resource capabilities, so we can grow this brand. This is a powerful brand. It's doing 6,300 guests a week. There is no one out there in casual dining doing that kind of volume. This is exciting for us.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","Brett Levy","Can you share a little bit on your use across the casual -- across the competitive landscape between promotional, regional and also what you\u2019re seeing on labor? And also what kind of impacts do you think Amazon\u2019s move into Whole Foods can have either directly or indirectly in the restaurant industry? Thank you.","Gene Lee","I would say a couple of comments on the industry. I still say there is pockets that there\u2019s some real strength, there is some pockets where there is some weakness. We\u2019re still seeing an upscale where we used in. You\u2019re seeing real weakness in New York City, which has had a little bit of impact on capital growth. But overall, I haven't seen a whole lot of change in the competitive landscape. The consumer in our view is not as reactionary to short term incentives, they come in and eat. They're looking for everyday value, and that's something that we continue to promote.","If you look at our promotions, they've been actually a little bit higher priced than they have been historically. We're using other ways to get at the value consumer, so that I have nothing new to report on the environment. Again, if you look at the indexes, because of the calendar -- a little bit because of the calendar swing you had some more strength in our fourth quarter versus where we were in our third quarter. Labor, we continue to see some pretty good inflationary pressure. We're thrilled that we're able to think or actually improve our retention rates right now; our team members are staying with us; they're engaged, but there is some inflation; there's 3% to 4% wage inflation in our labor number, right now; we're able to offset some of that with productivity enhancements. But labor continues to be something that we're focused on.","And lastly, the question on Amazon, the only way Amazon's in our world right now is through Amazon Prime delivery; we have a test going with them; we'll continue to partner with them and see if we can make that work; we constantly sit around here thinking about how does Amazon have an impact on our business. Our research tells us that guests still want to come to restaurants. Believe it or not, millennials still want to come to restaurants. I know you all don't think millennials go to casual dining restaurants, but 30% of all of our guests are millennials versus the 24% -- they're 24% of the population, so we over index. Cheddar's really over indexes with millennials as does Olive Garden. People still want to come to restaurants and have that experience. And we just got to provide them the right experience and the right value. And I think that's what we're doing at all our brands today and that's why we continue to win.","Brett Levy","Just one follow-up on that, on the indirect side. Do you feel that, as we're starting to see the narrowing of the CPI gap, if this leads to a little bit more of a promotional cadence at the grocers and they're not actually going to push price up? Do you think that there's any risk to what could happen at the restaurant level margins? Thanks.","Gene Lee","No, I mean I haven't been a believer in that philosophy from the get-go that the deflation in grocery stores has impacted the restaurant business. I mean we have, we just haven't seen that correlation. And when we look at the industry data, we have a few grocery people in our ranks now that know a little bit about that business. I'm just not a believer in that thought. And so I think it\u2019s imperative for us to keep our value equation in line with what the consumers' expectation is. And if you look at -- I think go back and look at Olive Garden's menu today, I mean four years ago we didn't have a $999 price point, I think we have soup, salad and bread sticks. Today, we have all-day Cucina Mia at $999; we have Lunch Duos starting at $699; we have the Early Dinner Duos staring at $899. You look at the face of our lunch menu and you don\u2019t see a whole lot over $999. And I think that\u2019s what -- I think we got to continue to find ways to take cost out of the business so that we can keep our value equation in line with what the consumer wants.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have David Tarantino of Baird. Sir, your line is open.","David Tarantino","Just first a clarification question Gene on that last points. Did you mentioned the level of pricing that you have embedded in your guidance for this year, the 1% to 2% comp guidance?","Rick Cardenas","What we've said in the past and we\u2019ll just reiterate here is we expect to take pricing in between 1% to 2% a year. We usually try to get on the on the lower end of that range, probably the same thing next year so probably the lower end of that.","David Tarantino","And then I guess my question is about Cheddar's, and Gene and Rick you shared some additional metrics. And I was just wondering what your thoughts are on your ability to grow the volumes or the average unit volumes at Cheddar's given how strong the traffic trends already are, do you have capacity to grow? And where do you think those can go overtime?","Rick Cardenas","Well, I think that's a very good question, David. And Cheddar's is underpenetrated in its markets today. And they've historically been really concerned about cannibalization. We don\u2019t believe that's the right thought process. We believe in relative market share as a way to drive overall profitability. So we will continue -- as we grow this, we think we\u2019re going to backfill our markets, the gains from efficiencies. And so I don\u2019t know whether the play here is to see average unit volumes go up or is it really an total sales play and to improve overall profitability with better relative market share inside the market.","Now with that said, top cortile restaurants are at $7.5 million -- $5.5 million. And so as you think about, there is capacity but I'm not going to be afraid of cannibalization, I mean for me it's the same argument. We have 500 Olive Garden's, we were doing -- our average unit volumes were higher, but our total sales were a lot less. And I think about this as total sales for the brand and overall total profitability. And I would urge everybody not to focus on what the average unit volumes are. My guess is the system they\u2019re going to come down overtime, because we don\u2019t need a new investment to do $4.5 million to get a great return on invested capital. And so we\u2019ll continue to build these things out just as we do with Olive Garden, volumes had to come down to get to almost $4 billion in sales.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","John Glass","Rick, first if I can just go to the guidance that you provided for 2018, if you backed out the accretion from Cheddar's, it's a mid-single digit EPS growth number. I understand taxes are going to be higher and there\u2019s a few other, and those shares are higher. Is that all there is? I mean, inflation looks benign. Is there is going to be more G&A investment required next year, is there another piece I guess that I'm missing?","Rick Cardenas","John, you\u2019re not missing anything else. One of the things is we are going to be pricing below our inflationary impacts. And so we\u2019re doing this for the long run. As Gene mentioned, we\u2019re going to leverage Darden's advantages, leverage Darden's scale the price below, inflation in our competition to grow market share overtime. So next year, yes, we\u2019ll be in the higher single digit without Cheddars. But I don\u2019t think you can look at it just without Cheddar\u2019s. One of the reasons we bought Cheddar\u2019s is to continue to grow. And so taking Cheddar\u2019s out of the mix probably isn\u2019t the way to look at it. That said, yes, without Cheddar\u2019s we\u2019re close to the high single digits. And share count is a lot higher than you guys would have had in your models for a couple of reasons; one, as you saw, we ended the year with 127 million shares roughly; even our average share count for the year was 126 million. And so one of the thing that\u2019s happening to us next year is the change in stock comp accounting is going to add another half million shares to our share count, will be offset by our share buyback. So that\u2019s why our share count is higher than what your model says. We\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchase, but we have between 100 million and 200 million in share repurchases in the plan next year.","John Glass","And then now on Cheddar\u2019s, you talked about POS integration and that takes a year. Is that largely going to be a cost benefit you\u2019d be able to manage their P&Ls better with that information, or is a sales driving tool? I guess, asked another way, what I'm driving at is what are the tools you can bring to Cheddar\u2019s to drive better comps? I know you said it's not an easy game, but at the same time, better comps get better margins and this is a brand that\u2019s under comping your other brands. How do you bridge that if you desire to drive higher comps? How do you do that? Is that a POS item or what are the leverages that you give them?","Rick Cardenas","The POS is the backbone, John. It really gives us the data and insights that we need to end up driving the business long term. The productivity tools labor, food cost management, all those -- what I call the productivity tools, will be added after we get the POS system. And we have to install the POS system to do that. Also, to grow productivity we\u2019ll increase because we\u2019ll be able to do online ordering. And so we know from doing these in the past, we\u2019ve got to get the POS system and then we can plug then into the rest of the Darden productivity tools to help run the business. We look at under-comping our business that\u2019s still beating the industry by 300 basis points. We\u20195re still doing 6,400 -- 6300 guests a week. There is still a lot for us to learn on what's the right balance between guest counts and price. We have to really lay out what the long term strategy is to maximize the brand. I wouldn\u2019t be concerned about the comp level, at this point. This thing is powerful. We\u2019re probably six to nine months away from fully realizing everything we have with this brand and what's the best strategy going forward.","Operator","Next we have Will Slabaugh of Stephens. Sir, your line is open.","Will Slabaugh","I had a question on real estate as it pertains to Cheddar\u2019s, and then more broadly, if you would. It seems that with Cheddar\u2019s large AVs and industry low ticket, the foot traffic has been pretty impressive, which implies you need to be bid on with the site selection. So as you look at the total store count in your slide deck for Cheddar's, it looks like it\u2019s only grown a handful of net stores over the past few years. So wonder if you could talk about the Company's history there, and how you feel about your ability to continue to find the right sites that can put up those types of volumes?","Gene Lee","Yes, sites aren't a problem, okay. We can find the sites. We could give Cheddar's 30 sites tomorrow with our systems and what we have. And if you look at the Cheddar's footprint, it reminds me a lot of like the Texas Roadhouse footprint where they\u2019re in second third tier suburban type areas, I mean those sites are a lot easier to get and trying to get a Yard House site. The sites aren\u2019t the problem here. When you look at their history, they had a rapid growth period where they outran or outgrew their human resources. I keep come back to this. And we continue to learn this lesson sometimes the hard way and we learned it with seasons. We outgrew our human resources and we paid a price for that.","Before Cheddar's can grow, we need to ensure that they're culturally strong with a strong bench of general managers who can run these recipes, high volume complicated restaurants. And it's going to be a purely when management tells us that they have the human resources to go, we will stock the pipeline and they can open as many restaurants if they have the human resources to do. I'm committed to not force this management team to get out ahead of itself. I've learned this lesson over last 20 years too many times. I'm not going to learn it again. We're going to only open restaurants that we have great management to open these restaurants. And they\u2019re, at this point in time, they're still recovering from that fast growth phase. Ian's only been in for a little around two years, and he is incredibly focused on building that.","Now, can we use some of our resources in our vast pool of restaurants to go over and maybe help them, yes. But you still have cultural challenges that people have to understand that Cheddar's culture before they can go in and run one of these businesses. We can't just transform from one of our other restaurant to say, hey go run this 6,500 guest count restaurant that's got a much lower check average and different employment phase started out. And so work to be done here, but sites will not be a problem at all. I mean right now I'm just holding back our Chief Development Officer to say we have people, we'll let you know.","Will Slabaugh","Then a quick follow-up, if I could. Have you given the average check most recently for Cheddar's?","Gene Lee","Well, I'd say about 13.50.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. Sir, your line is open.","Gregory Francfort","Just maybe one quick housekeeping one. On the 35 to 40 openings, how many of those are going to be Cheddar's this year?","Gene Lee","Greg, it's going to be four to five this coming up year.","Gregory Francfort","And then just on the margins, on 2% overall inflation, I guess, does that mean that if you comp above 2%, there's margin upside and if you comp below 2%, there's margin downside. And I guess my question asked another way is are there more cost savings opportunities you guys have to drive additional margin upside from here, and I guess where will those programs be focused?","Rick Cardenas","Greg, it's not as simple as the comping above 2% or below 2%, because we do have some cost saves that we have identified. But we're not to announce how much they are, because normally when we talk about cost saves, we say this is going to be the net P&L impact of them. What we\u2019re doing now with our cost saves is we\u2019re going to continue to invest in pricing below our inflation and pricing below our competition. So that's one of the investments that we\u2019re doing with these cost saves. We're also going to invest in quality, enhancing quality like we've done with LongHorn and Olive Garden, continue these investments to drive market share in the future. That said, what we have mention in our long-term frame work in the past is we still expect to be within our long-term framework of EBIT expansion year-over-year. So our long-term trend will be 10 basis points to 40 basis points. We expect to be in that even with pricing at the below inflation line.","Gregory Francfort","And maybe if I can speak one last one, and just on the technology platform changes, or not the changes but the changes you\u2019re putting into Cheddar's. I guess what are the competitive advantages around the technology you have and how do those show-up operationally in the stores?","Gene Lee","Greg, I can tell you about a lot of competitive advantages but let me start with the backbone, which our POS. Because we own and operate our own POS and we develop all of the things we can pull all the data and keep all of the data and match that to check level information, match that to demographic information match that to even operational information. So we\u2019re able to find out who the best people to run a shift are based on all of the data that we have. And an ancillary benefit of moving them to our backbone is we don\u2019t have to pay for the POS, I mean that's something that we've developed overtime and it's now spread across Cheddar's as well.","So I can probably name of many when we any of -- on a one-on-one call, we can talk about them, we've talked them before. I'll give you a couple of more; labor management, when we put them on our labor management system it's not just a scheduling tools it's a management tool; how do you manage labor; how do you manage in and out times; how do you manage breaks, et cetera. And those are the things that we've built overtime that other people try to copy and it's hard to do.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","David Palmer","First, a follow-up on to go, it looks like you are approaching 600,000 per restaurant in to go. Are you still thinking you'll get to the 1 million or maybe that's changing, and how important do you think delivery is going to be for you to get there?","Rick Cardenas","We still believe we\u2019re going to get them. We have restaurants already over 1 million and takeout. And we continue to look at our processes and procedures, maybe even dedicating little bit more stake internally to be able to fulfill this demand. On the takeout -- on the delivery, we\u2019re focused on -- right now, we're focused on large party delivery. We see the opportunity there versus moving $10 meal here and $10 mean there. We can do a large party with an average check of approximately $300 that's where we need to focus, and that's what we decided the opportunity is.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Peter Saleh of BTIG. Sir, your line is open.","Peter Saleh","Gene, I think you mentioned guest satisfaction scores at Olive Garden were an all-time high. Can we just take a step back and just remind us again when do we see the trajectory on the guest satisfaction scores start to really improve and what were you guys doing at the brand, at that time?","Gene Lee","We start to really improve was probably about 18 months ago, they were improving but it was more of trajectory. And then since we've introduced Ziosk we\u2019ve seen -- that's really been a better way to measure if we\u2019re getting real feedback from a lot more guests. The key here is simplification. We\u2019ve made these restaurants easier for our managers to run and easier to execute the food where we\u2019ve brought the menus in a little bit. And one of the keys as you design menus is to be able to move a lot of products, you develop reputation. And so you focus the demand in on fewer items, you become better at delivering them, and you are much faster. And simplification has been the key and I have been saying after three years. We\u2019re not done yet, we still think we can make these operations simpler. It's going to take a while because there are ramifications from a profitability standpoint as you simplify. The smaller the menu the less stuff you sale. But we have to try to figure that out. But I am confident that it\u2019s a simplification of the operation that\u2019s driving guest satisfaction.","Peter Saleh","Then just a follow up, the Cheddar\u2019s brand is that also have the Ziosk or is that something you guys are considering? Or is that -- are we too early in this conversation?","Gene Lee","It's too early in this conversation. I think that it's something that we could consider down the road. But there is no way from a technology standpoint that we could support that implementation right now. And as Rick talked about, a lot of things that we\u2019re doing to bring Cheddar\u2019s up to speed and get on our platform means that there is other work to support our other businesses that aren\u2019t getting done this year, they\u2019re getting pushed back a little bit. And so right now it's just a matter of technological resources. Do I think Ziosk could be a good option Cheddar\u2019s down the road, yes. But it's not in the immediate future. We don\u2019t have the work, the capabilities, to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Two questions, the first one is just a follow up perhaps for Rick on the fiscal '18 guidance. I think previously you had said prior to Cheddar I think the total shareholder return would -- it\u2019ll be reasonable that you\u2019d been within that 10% to 15% range. Now, it looks like -- we\u2019re talking about maybe 12% to 15% total shareholder return with Cheddar\u2019s. I am just wondering if there was anything that might have changed in recent months, or whether it's just conservatism that now we\u2019re not at or above the high end with that $0.12 accretion, and then one follow-up.","Rick Cardenas","Let's start with what we said our long term guidance is. Our long term framework is 10% to 15% total shareholder return. We did say that\u2019s over the long run, and there will be years it will be above that and below that. That said, the biggest reason that our TSR the way we\u2019re talking about it the implied TSR is at 11.9% to 15%, which is what our guidance would imply is because our share count is diluting because of stock comp and other things. If you go and you look at our guidance and the way we\u2019ve implied our sales growth and our margin expansion, you can back into an e-growth that is above our long term framework.","And so remember, e-growth is part of that TSR and e-growth is above our long term framework if you do the math you can figure that out. The only reason that we have TSR at the lower end or within our framework is because of the share count dilution that we have for one year. One more point on share count. Every year, our share count has declined year-over-year at the end of the year. The only reason it\u2019s changing next year is because we bought most of our shares early this year. We're assuming that we're going to buy them evenly throughout next year and because of the change in accounting rules for stock comp that automatically adds close to 0.5 million shares at the beginning of the year, which will be there for the whole year.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Second point was just -- a question maybe more for Gene. Just looking back to the last quarter or two, you had mentioned when you think about the industry that you would characterize the consumer as stable. I was wondering, I think you guys said you really don't see much change in the promotional activity. I'm assuming that means you still think the consumer's stable. But the widening gap versus the industry I mean, wondering I think you've given some color as to how you think that's happening. But maybe if we could just talk about the buckets of the industry, I get the feeling bar and grill is sitting in the bottom quartile, and you guys need to be sitting at the top quartile. But just wondering what you think perhaps their biggest issue is that you guys are avoiding to just see that widening gap? I just can only imagine the width of the gap if you guys are as high as you are.","Gene Lee","Jeff, the only thing I would say, I'm not going to comment on what I think our competitors are doing. I would say that we have some large competitors out there that are donating significant share. And we're stealing, I would say, we're stealing that share because I think that we've got a more compelling offer; Olive Garden is really after that value consumer; Longhorn is pivoted, I think appropriately and put a lot of the quality back into the product, and that seems to be resonating with their guests.","And so I know it's not fancy or sexy, but it really comes down to just pure execution and those who continue to execute at highest level continue to win. And you got to have a promise that consumer wants. And I think that's where we really focused and we delivered against that. And I go back to -- I think our team members are more engaged than ever; I think our value is stronger than ever; and I think that our guest experiences continue to improve; and all our research tells us that. And so we just need to stay on our plan, which is to under price inflation, take cost out of the business to cover that, and win market share each and every year. And I think that's the plan we started off on three years ago and we've executed against that.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","David Palmer","Just building on Jeff's question a little bit about the grill and bar killer that could be Cheddar's, I mean, I'm wondering how you're thinking about things from a trade area perspective. And I'm wondering if you're sort of pivoting a little bit in terms of where you're growing. The specialty brands were lighter than your other brands in terms of comps, particularly Olive Garden, which has to go. The retail go dark risk seems to be intensifying, and mall traffic trends are already pretty bad. Cheddar's might be a way for you to grow away from those trade areas and then maybe benefit from some of the struggles that are going on in grill and bar. Is that a little bit of a pivot as to how you're going to grow, going forward, particularly at the Amazon risk is upon us?","Gene Lee","Well, I think you've highlighted some strengths of the Cheddar's brand where it's not a brand that we put. Historically, they put in a tier 1 trade area sit in front of a mall, the use of always been a little bit off more in a second or third tier trade area in a city or town. They've been very good on what they\u2019re willing to pay for real-estate, and so I do think that this brand does view to a lower demographic. And therefore, you\u2019re not going to really find a lot of Cheddar's and LongHorn's in the same trade area. They might overlap with an Olive Garden, but we've got a different target with Cheddar's. And I think this gives us the opportunity to take advantage of real-estate that some of our other brands can't utilize today. And you\u2019re looking at a real-estate site, you\u2019re not deciding between Cheddar's and Yard House. Those are two totally different sites. And so I think you\u2019re right on. We can continue to use this brand differently than we've used our other brands.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Andy Barish of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","Andy Barish","Couple of quick margin questions, just on the labor line, overall. Do you still have enough productivity improvements to be able to offset that 3% to 4% inflation? And then just in terms of folding in Cheddar's for this year. Are there any particular line items that defer from Darden previous Cheddar's that we can give it call it out with the low check maybe impacting food cost or the significant amount of prep activity, fresh prep impacting labor cost. Just anything we should think about from a margin perspective at Cheddar's.","Gene Lee","Andy, first question about labor and do we have enough cost saves or enough productivity enhancements, we still believe we have productivity enhancements to help keep our labor reasonably flat year-over-year as even with the pricing a little bit below inflation. But it's still pricing it will help us cover some of that labor. In regards to Cheddar's and their margin, I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail on the individual margin line items. But I will tell you, their EBITDA is about restaurant level of 17%, which is essentially the way we calculate segment profit. Yes, they have a little bit more production in their restaurants because they\u2019re a scratch kitchen, so you would expect labor would be a little higher than what our normal brands are. You would expect cost of sales to be little bit lower. But if you think about their overall margins at 17%, still strong in the industry, maybe not strong compared to Olive Garden, which is hard and top and they will be in our other segment. And so because of that and because of the competitive reasons, we don\u2019t want to get into too much more detail about the individual line items.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Ma'am, your line is open.","Karen Holthouse","The comment earlier on the long-term framework intend of 40 basis points of EBIT expansion, and fiscal '18 still falling within that. Would that be -- is that on a standalone basis prior to any mix shifts you would want to think about for Cheddar's or at all in number, thinking about fiscal '17 to fiscal '18?","Gene Lee","That is an all-in number, 10 basis points to 40 basis points includes bringing Cheddar's in and their actual decline in total margin across Darden. So without Cheddar\u2019s, the margin expansion would have been higher than what we\u2019re going to show. But we\u2019re still 10 to 40 basis points with Cheddar\u2019s added to the mix.","Karen Holthouse","And is there any sort of ballpark way to think about synergies for what would hit at the store level versus G&A? I know its Yard House, at the time you talked about I think 60% of synergies at the store level. Is that the rate framework going forward, or is there a reason to think about that differently?","Gene Lee","It's pretty close. It's just a 50-50, so probably 50% of them are going to hit at the restaurant level and 50% at the G&A level. Now, not all of the synergies are going to accrue to Cheddar\u2019s, there will be some of those synergies in the G&A. For example that will accrue to the rest of the brands as well but about 50% of our total synergies will be in G&A and about 50% restaurant level, which actually demonstrates the power of the Darden platform and how much we can go out and purchase at a lower rate than others. So Cheddar\u2019s actually had a really good supply chain team. They did great purchasing and we\u2019re still able to find significant synergies bringing them into our system.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","Andrew Strelzik","Two questions for you. The first one the bump in the CapEx relative how you outlined it last quarter, seems like it's more than just the bump in the development phase; so wondering what else is in there, number one and number two, from a food cost perspective within that flat to plus one, how should we think about the cadence kind of story here. I noticed the mid single digit these decline that you got in there. So I am wondering how to think about the cadence of that throughout the year?","Gene Lee","Andrew, in regards to the food cost cadence throughout the year and we talked about what our first half of the year is going to be. Our first half of the year slightly deflationary, very slightly, maybe flat and then the back half of the year is going to be somewhat inflationary. So it will just start to grow overtime. And as we said in the past, we tell you what we know and then when we don\u2019t know it we assume a normal inflationary period. So as we get farther in the year, we\u2019re going to assume more normal inflationary period. And I completely forgot your first question. Can you remind me?","Andrew Strelzik","Sure. That was on the CapEx side. It seems like the increase in the dollars, how you outlined it last quarter\u2026","Gene Lee","The CapEx, the difference is basically Cheddar\u2019s. In the first guidance we gave, back in March, we didn\u2019t have Cheddar\u2019s in the guidance and now we\u2019re including Cheddar\u2019s. So when you add their restaurants and you add their maintenance CapEx, you\u2019re talking about $40 million to $50 million and that\u2019s really the difference.","Operator","Thank you. Next is John Ivankoe of J. P. Morgan. Sir, your line is open.","John Ivankoe","Just a couple of questions on the industry, if I may; firstly, have you seen any change or softness at any locations you have that are very specifically located with retail and maybe around some of the bigger retailers that have closed. Just wanted to get a sense how sensitive or insensitive those types of locations have been for your business?","Gene Lee","John, I can't isolate Macy\u2019s or J. C. Penny closing, or Sears and having an impact on any of our businesses at this point in time.","John Ivankoe","I mean, you certainly can\u2019t see it in the comp. And looking at supply and demand across the industry, where are we in terms of rate of change maybe as we\u2019ve been over the last six or 12 months? And do you see that being potentially changing the slate in the cycle?","Gene Lee","I think demand for casuals is about the same. I mean we\u2019re growing a little faster than population growth, the last numbers I saw from Crest. Where we're seeing growth in more in the upscale; the cycle is getting a little lengthy here and everybody that's got a little bit of money wants to be in the Ssteakhouse of the upscale business. So we are seeing some local growth in upscale restaurants, but that has a way of washing itself out over time.","John Ivankoe","And secondly, the industry does have easier comparison -- does have easy comparisons for a long time, but easier comparisons in the first half of your fiscal '18. I mean what type of industry assumptions are you making for your 1% to 2% comp in '18?","Gene Lee","No change to the industry. We're assuming that it's basically been doing what it\u2019s been doing the last 12 months.","John Ivankoe","So industry still remaining negative, and you still remaining positive?","Gene Lee","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Steve Anderson of Maxim Group. Sir, your line is open.","Steve Anderson","With regard to your continued -- rather the integration of the Cheddar's operation; do you contemplate that buying back any of the 25 franchise restaurants during that period, or is it something you might want to delay till after that 12 month activation period? And should we assume -- what assumptions should we make about those stores? Thanks.","Rick Cardenas","We're in the middle of integration with Cheddar's. And actually we're really in the middle of two integrations, because Cheddar's bought their largest franchisee, Greer in January. So we're really doing two and we'd rather not have to do three. So we'll keep being a great franchisor to these franchisees and let us get through this integration before we start talking about what we do with the 25.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Jordy Winslow of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line's open.","Jordy Winslow","Just had a couple of questions on Cheddar's; first, on the margin profile. Where do you see those store level margins potentially going over time? Is it possible in your mind that they could reach the level of Olive Garden potentially? And if not, are there any structural differences between the two brands that you see that would prevent that type of convergence? And then I have one follow up. Thanks.","Gene Lee","Yes, I think the way to think about Cheddar's isn't the absolute margin for each restaurant. This is a total growth story. And to me it's about overtime -- we're just a brand in upward totals, total sales and total margins. And if our goal was just to try to maximize these restaurant margins, we'd never open another restaurant. And so we're too early in the game to determine what we think the long term target of these margins are. We know this is going to be a value player. We see this as a way to really put pressure on the industry and keep pricing down, and we will. In short term, if we have to, we'll sacrifice margin to do that, to grow this business.","So give us a little bit more time to understand this business in more detail, understand as they plug into our platform what the real opportunities are and then we'll talk about what the margin potential is later. But you have to remember, if you\u2019re going to try to grow a brand and make it a mass brand, you got to have a legitimate restaurant level margin target for you to be able to keep the value equation where you want to keep it and continue to grow sales. And we look at Cheddar's and we look at the returns on new restaurants, even at the current margin level. And we're excited about that. We\u2019re excited about the value we\u2019ll create for our shareholders by building these restaurants, and trying to maximize the margins on the existing base. It\u2019s a onetime bump for that. Real shareholder value is going to come from us being able to grow this brand and get great returns on our invested capital. And we believe that's a huge opportunity for us with this brand.","Jordy Winslow","And then more of a clarifying question on the openings. I thought that last call you had spoken about eight Cheddar's restaurants in the pipeline through fiscal year '18. Has something changed going from that to four to five, or is there any kind of timing difference going on with that?","Jordy Winslow","Nothing has changed. It's really timing of fiscal year differences, and we\u2019ve talked about their pipeline. It was more in the calendar year basis, not necessarily fiscal year basis. And based on our fiscal years, it would equate to about four to five in fiscal '18 for us instead of eight which was kind of calendar \u201818.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to our speakers for closing remarks.","Kevin Kalicak","Thank you, Ray. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind you all that we plan to release first quarter results on Tuesday, September 26th, before the market opens with a conference call to follow.

[Operator Instructions] And today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the meeting over to Matthew Stroud, Vice President of Investor Relations for Darden.

These results were available on PR Newswire and other wire services. We recognize that most of you have reviewed our fourth quarter earnings results, so we won't take the time to go into them in detail once again in an effort to provide more time for your questions.","We will offer a line item summary of the P&L, discuss our financial outlook for fiscal 2013 and discuss our brand-by-brand operating performance summary. In an effort to focus on our long-term guidance, we will not be discussing near-term results such as the month-to-date sales trends.","With that, let me turn it over to Clarence.","Clarence Otis","Thanks, Matthew. And I'll start just by briefly sharing at a very high level our assessment of the business including performance last year, so fiscal 2012, and what we expect this year, fiscal 2013. Then Brad, Drew and Gene are going to provide more detail on both few years and on the fourth quarter last year.","But from a total sales perspective, results in 2012, excluding the Eddie V's acquisition, was just over 6%, which is short of our long-term target for total sales growth of between 7% and 9%. With respect to new restaurants, which is one of our 2 sales growth drivers, growth accelerated significantly in 2012 compared to the prior year and came close to the 5% long-term target that we've had for some time now.","Now with the unit potential, new unit potential, of our current portfolio and that's been fortified by the acquisition of Eddie V's, the value-creating returns that we're getting from new restaurants and the strength of our real estate and talent pipelines, and those are the foundations for successful unit expansion, we expect to meet our 5% target for new restaurant growth in fiscal 2013 and then meet or exceed it for at least the next 4 years after that.","The second sales growth driver is same-restaurant sales. And in 2012, combined same-restaurant sales growth at our 3 large casual dining brands was roughly 0.5 point -- 0.5 percentage point higher than it was the prior year and 0.5 percentage point higher than the industry average. This growth was fueled by strong results at Red Lobster and LongHorn, and each of those brands is benefiting from successful efforts over the past 2 years to refresh all the things that drive success in this business, including their core menus, promotional strategies, advertising and facilities among other things. And we expect continued progress in each of these areas as we go forward.","There was same-restaurant sales softness at Red Lobster in the fourth quarter, but much of that reflects our commitment to maintaining an appropriate degree of balance in our annual promotional calendar. It's important to have both price-approachable and premium price offers so that we don't commoditize Red Lobster or any of our other brands around price.","Lobsterfest, which runs during the Lenten season, has long been an important premium price offer in Red Lobster's promotional calendar. This year, that timing worked against us because gasoline prices spiked during Lent; that reduced consumers' discretionary income, and more importantly, had an adverse effect on their confidence.","Now certainly as we look back at the full year, blended same-restaurant sales growth for the 3 big brands would have been even stronger without the decline we experienced at Olive Garden. As we've discussed with you before, we're doing a number of things to a reestablish growth at Olive Garden same-restaurant sales. One of the most important is the transition we're making from promotions built around a construct that features 1 or 2 specific dishes, which worked well for a long time, but has grown increasingly less effective over the past 2 years to a promotional construct that's built around a culinary or value theme and highlights several dishes or one or more menu categories.","As we make this transition, some of the promotions used in the new construct are going to meet or exceed expectations and others are going to fall short, and we certainly saw that in fiscal 2012. It's a transition that Red Lobster and LongHorn are further down the road on, and based on our experiences at those brands, we're confident that as we continue to learn with each of the new promotions that we introduce at Olive Garden, we should see less variability starting in 2013. And our confidence is bolstered by the fact that Olive Garden's promotional offers in fiscal 2013 are going to be supported by other initiatives beyond promotions that Drew's going to touch upon in a moment.","In our Specialty Restaurant Group, same-restaurant sales growth at each brand was strong in fiscal 2013 -- 2012 rather, and that speaks to really the good competitive position that each of those brands have, and it also speaks to the fact that each has a guest base that's just better insulated from the macroeconomic sluggishness that we've seen. And as Gene is going to outline in a moment, that group will build on these strengths in fiscal 2013.","We do expect macroeconomic sluggishness to continue in our fiscal 2013. And given this outlook and where each of our brands is, we built our plan around the assumption that blended same-restaurant sales growth for the 3 large brands will be comparable in 2013 to what it was in 2012. We've also taken a similar approach regarding same-restaurant sales growth for the Specialty Restaurant Group.","Now with those same-restaurant sales assumptions and accelerated new restaurant growth, we expect meaningfully stronger earnings growth in fiscal 2013 than we had in fiscal 2012, and that's because we were burdened in 2012 with food cost inflation headwinds that we don't anticipate in 2013.","Our earnings outlook for 2013 though does reflect important incremental investment in the business on both a P&L and a capital investment basis. And this is investment that reflects our view that we have to dedicate more people and more financial resources than we have in the past to identifying and capturing big sales-building opportunities that have multiyear time horizons. These are opportunities that generally involve technology, marketing and other initiatives that target younger guests, multicultural guests, more financially secure guests and that increase the visit frequency of current guests by increasing our relevance for more occasions.","And so as we enter fiscal 2013, we're looking for accelerated new restaurant growth, same-restaurant sales growth that's similar to fiscal 2012 on an overall basis but has a healthier mix from a brand perspective, driven by better results at Olive Garden. And we're looking for meaningfully elevated earnings growth even as we make important investments that we think are necessary to sustain profitable sales growth beyond 2013.","So with that, let me turn it over to Brad to provide some financial detail about the fourth quarter of 2012 and about the full fiscal year. So, Brad?","C. Bradford Richmond","Thank you, Clarence. Darden's total sales from continuing operations increased 3.8% in the fourth quarter to $2,070,000,000. On a blended same-restaurant sales basis, results for Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse were down 1.9% in the fourth quarter, which includes the adverse effect of an earlier Lenten season and Easter that impacted blended same-restaurant sales by 40 basis points.","Olive Garden's fourth quarter U.S. same-restaurant sales were down 1.8%. Red Lobster's fourth quarter U.S. same-restaurant sales fell 3.9%. This includes the adverse impact of 130 basis points due to the earlier Lenten season and Easter along with the shift of Lobsterfest.","LongHorn Steakhouse fourth quarter U.S. same-restaurant sales increased 3.0%, and we saw continued strong same-restaurant sales gains in our Specialty Restaurant Group with plus 2.7% same-restaurant sales growth on a blended basis.","For the fourth quarter, same-restaurant sales increased 2.8% at Capital Grille, 2.8% at Bahama Breeze and 1.9% at Seasons 52.","Now let's review the margin analysis for the fourth quarter. Food and beverage expenses were 45 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis. The increase in food and beverage expense is attributable to year-over-year inflation in seafood and beef cost. This is a sharp improvement from the 250 basis points of unfavorability we reported in the first half of the fiscal year and approximately 175 basis points of unfavorability in the third quarter.","Fourth quarter same -- fourth quarter restaurant labor expenses were 50 basis points lower than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to increased productivity and lower restaurant manager incentive compensation expense. Restaurant expenses in the quarter were essentially flat to last year on a percentage of sales basis as lower credit card expenses were offset with increased preopening expense related to 9 net units opens in the quarter and additional openings in early fiscal 2013.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were 74 basis points lower than last year as a percentage of sales due to sales leveraging, lower incentive compensation and a reduction in media spend at Olive Garden. Drew will have more to say about the lower media spend there shortly.","Depreciation expense in the quarter was 27 basis points higher as a percentage of sales basis compared to last year due to increased new units and remodels.","For the quarter, operating profit as a percentage of sales was 11.0%. Now that's 59 basis points better than last year and came from new restaurant growth leverage along with the combination of restaurant labor, selling, general and administrative expense improvements. In sum, this led to a 15% diluted net earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter.","During the fourth quarter, we also repurchased 400,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $18 million.","Now for the full fiscal year, Darden sales increased 6.6% in fiscal 2012 to $8.0 billion. This increase was driven by 100 net new restaurants, including the purchase of 11 Eddie V's Restaurants, the blended same-restaurant sales increase of 1.8% at our larger brands and a blended same-restaurant sales increase of 4.6% at the Specialty Restaurant Group.","On a brand-by-brand basis, Olive Garden's annual same-restaurant sales fell 1.2%. And its average unit volumes were $4.7 million, well above those of any other nationally advertised full-service restaurant brand. Red Lobster had a 4.6% same-restaurant sales increase for the year, and its average unit volumes were $3.8 million, which is also high within the category. LongHorn Steakhouse same-restaurant sales increased 5.3%, and its average unit volumes were $3.0 million. The Capital Grille same-restaurant sales increased 5.3% and its average unit volumes were $6.8 million, well ahead of its nearest multi-unit competitor. Bahama Breeze same-restaurant sales increased 3.4%, and average unit volumes were $5.6 million. And Seasons 52 same-restaurant sales increased 3.8%, and average unit volumes were $6.4 million.","Our same-restaurant sales results and high average unit volumes support value-creating new unit growth. And in fiscal 2012, Olive Garden opened 38 net new restaurants, LongHorn Steakhouse opened 32 net new restaurants, Red Lobster opened 6 net new restaurants. The Capital Grille opened 2 net new restaurants. Bahama Breeze opened 4 net new restaurants. And Seasons 52 opened 6 new restaurants. Plus we opened one more Synergy restaurant pairing a Red Lobster and Olive Garden for a total of 89 net new restaurants for the year, excluding the purchase of 11 Eddie V's Restaurants.","We purchased $375 million of shares for the year. In the last 5 years, we've purchased $1.15 billion of our stock while maintaining a solid investment grade credit profile, which really speaks to the significant cash flow we generate on a consistent basis. We have 16.5 million shares remaining in our current repurchase authorization, and I'll discuss our plans for repurchase in fiscal 2013 following Gene's remarks.","Given our ability to consistently generate strong cash flows, today we announced an increase in our dividend of $0.50 per share payable on August 1, 2012, to shareholders of record at July 10, 2012. We previously paid a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share or $1.72 per share on an annual basis. Based on the $0.50 quarterly dividend declaration, our indicated annual dividend is $2 per share, an increase of 16%. This equates to a payout ratio on a forward basis of approximately 50% based on the upper end of our fiscal 2013 diluted EPS expectation. We have increased our dividends by 100% over the last 3 years, which speaks to the consistent cash flow we generate and our intent to return more capital to shareholders through dividends.","And now, I'll turn it over to Drew to comment on Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse.","Andrew H. Madsen","Thank you, Brad. This morning, I'll discuss fiscal 2012 fourth quarter sales performance and fiscal 2013 strategic priorities for Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn, and then Gene will do the same for the brands in our Specialty Restaurant Group.","As Brad mentioned, our 3 large brands had a combined same-restaurant sales decline of 1.9% during the fourth quarter. And while some of this decline was due to holiday and promotional timing shifts at Red Lobster and lower advertising support at Olive Garden, most of the decline was the result of disappointing promotional performance at those 2 brands.","Now let me comment more specifically on our fourth quarter results. Olive Garden opened 16 new restaurants and delivered total sales growth of nearly 3%, high single-digit operating profit growth and solid margin expansion during the fourth quarter. However, same-restaurant sales fell 1.8%, which contrasts with the modest improvement we saw in the third quarter.","Olive Garden started the quarter with the final 3 weeks of their 3-course Italian dinner for $12.95 promotion. Now this promotion featured 5 new entr\u00e9es specifically designed for this price point from a margin perspective, and it included soup or salad plus the choice of an individual-sized dessert. They followed this with Passion for Parmesan that included 3 new entr\u00e9es: grilled chicken Parmesan, Parmesan-crusted shrimp and Parmesan-crusted steak that leveraged the broad appeal and crave-able nature of Parmesan cheese.","In mid-May, Olive Garden launched the Taste of Tuscany promotion with a starting at $10.95 price point. This promotion featured 2 new entr\u00e9es, saut\u00e9ed chicken with Asiago tortelloni and grilled Italian sausage with Orecchiette pasta and allowed guests to personalize their entr\u00e9e choice by adding 2 of 4 new Tuscan-inspired side dishes.","The majority of Olive Garden's decline in the fourth quarter versus prior year occurred during May when same-restaurant sales were down 4.6%, and we believe this reflects 2 dynamics: first, we decided not to advertise around Mother's Day, which resulted in 2 fewer weeks of television support during May this year compared to last year. In retrospect, this decision negatively impacted same-restaurant sales momentum given the significant level of competitive media across the industry at that time; second, the Taste of Tuscany promotion that started in May and has continued into June was not as effective as we anticipated.","As we've discussed before, beginning in the third quarter this year, Olive Garden began a transition in their promotion strategy: moving away from advertising 1 or 2 new dishes, occasionally with a price point, to featuring broader platform ideas that guests find more compelling. This approach was effective with the 3-course meal for $12.95 promotion during February and March.","We were also satisfied with the results for Passion for Parmesan during March and April when same-restaurant guest count results at Olive Garden were equal to our estimate of industry performance. But the Taste of Tuscany promotion did not work nearly as well. Our assessment is that this promotion was too much about the brand, especially the desirability and culinary inspiration of Tuscany, and not enough about the $10.95 price point and affordability of the new dishes.","So with this learning, going forward, when Olive Garden chooses to feature an approachable price point in their promotion, the broader platform idea that we will communicate to guests will focus more single-mindedly on affordability. As an example, Olive Garden's next promotion is 2 for $25. It offers guests the opportunity to enjoy unlimited soup or salad, their choice of entr\u00e9e plus a shareable appetizer or dessert all for just $25. It starts next week and is a good example of using the new promotion platform in a way that has a more single-minded focus on affordability.","At Red Lobster, total sales declined 2.8% during the fourth quarter despite continued improvement in most business fundamentals and in most brand equity measures. So we believe the results were primarily because our promotional offerings fell short of expectations. Same-restaurant sales declined 3.9%. Although adjusting for the impact of an earlier Lenten season and Easter, same-restaurant sales fell 2.6% during the quarter.","Red Lobster advertised Lobsterfest in March and part of April. Lobsterfest featured a variety of classic and new entr\u00e9es this year, including new Maine lobster and Shrimp Trio and new Bar Harbor lobster bake. They finished the quarter with Festival of Shrimp, which offered guests the opportunity to create their own experience by selecting any 2 shrimp options for $12.99.","As Clarence mentioned, we believe it is important to keep a balance of approachably priced and premium price offers in our promotions because that helps us stay relevant to guests who are more economically constrained, as well as guests looking for a more distinctive experience. Lobsterfest is a signature promotion for Red Lobster and it obviously has a premium price. Given the challenging economic environment and sharp increase in gasoline prices that coincided with this promotion, a premium price offer like Lobsterfest was less well-suited for the period. Lobsterfest is best done during the Lenten season, and we believe the promotion continues to be an important way to differentiate Red Lobster from the competition generally and more specifically helps us keep the brand connected to guests who can afford to spend a little more, and as a result, keep them coming back.","Festival of Shrimp began in late April and continued through May. Now this was an effective promotion for Red Lobster during May last year, helping drive same-restaurant sales growth of 5%. This year, they added several new dishes like Tequila-lime grilled shrimp tacos. They also decided to raise the price by $1 from $11.99 to $12.99 based on its success last year and on research that suggested consumers were largely indifferent between $11.99 and $12.99. The price increase was also driven by the reality that seafood inflation, although moderated from where it was at the beginning of the year, was still elevated. The same-restaurant sales decline as May shows, however, that the price increase for this promotion turned out to be too aggressive.","Red Lobster also completed 66 remodels during the fourth quarter and 148 for the fiscal year. The remodeled restaurants continue to generate same-restaurant sales growth of 5% to 6% and generate returns in excess of the financial hurdle. We still anticipate completing the remodel program by the end of fiscal 2014.","LongHorn opened 12 new restaurants, delivered total sales growth of nearly 12%, high double-digit operating profit growth and solid margin expansion during the fourth quarter. And same-restaurant sales increased 3% during the quarter.","LongHorn began the quarter with their 5 Great Steaks, One Great Price just $11.99 promotion that featured a bacon-wrapped bourbon sirloin and a garlic herb-crusted sirloin. This was followed by their steak and seafood promotion that featured a sirloin and crab-stuffed mushroom plus a sirloin and lobster baked potato. Both promotions were supported by national cable television advertising. However, LongHorn had extra media in April this year compared to last year and less media in May this year compared to last year, which contributed to stronger same-restaurant sales growth in April and less robust growth in May.","LongHorn also completed the rollout of its meal pacing system during the fourth quarter, complementing the table management system implemented during the third quarter. Both tools will help LongHorn further elevate their in-restaurant execution and operations excellence.","Now before reviewing our fiscal 2013 strategic priorities, it's worth noting that each brand has developed plans to address the elevated need for affordability that our guests still have while also investing behind initiatives that will help build brand equity, ensure differentiated guest experiences and support longer-term growth.","As we discussed last quarter, we continue to view Olive Garden as a business where the vast majority of fundamentals remain competitively strong from average unit volumes and restaurant level profit margins to brand perception and employee retention.","We believe the primary cause of their same-restaurant sales softness during the past year or so has been a narrowing in their value leadership advantage that Olive Garden has enjoyed versus other large brands in the industry. And this was driven by a menu that got a little expensive after the financial crisis relative to competitive alternatives and a broader guest experience that became a little expected and failed to keep pace with guest expectations that started to evolve much faster than they had in the past and with an improving competitive set, including Red Lobster and LongHorn.","For the past year, Olive Garden has been working on strengthening their value leadership competitive advantage by improving affordability for their more economically challenged guests and on updating and evolving key elements of the guest experience to meet the increasing quality expectations of all of guests, especially more economically stable guests. In fiscal 2013, their guests will be exposed to more and more of the results of that work. More specifically, a majority of promotions at Olive Garden will feature approachable price points.","In addition, when Olive Garden chooses to feature a price point in their promotion, that platform idea that the promotion is based on will be more single-mindedly focused on affordability than they were in fiscal 2012. As I said earlier, the next promotion at Olive Garden will be a 2 for $25 offer that leverages the unlimited super salad course already included with every entr\u00e9e.","Beyond promotions, Olive Garden will introduce a new advertising campaign in the second quarter that puts a fresh face on the brand and more effectively ignites reconsideration from lapsed users. And importantly, this new campaign is still anchored in the brand DNA of family, value and Italian inspiration. However, the campaign will extend the definition of family to encompass the broader community and replace the current warm and emotionally nurturing tonality with more energy and passion for life.","Following the new advertising campaign, Olive Garden will introduce a new core menu in the third quarter that will help increase everyday affordability and strengthen value perceptions. This menu introduction will be supported with national advertising to make sure that our guests are aware that there's a new menu with enhanced affordability available at Olive Garden. We will also add new items throughout the year that help address gaps in the current menu and support guest count growth over time, including lighter and fresher entr\u00e9es.","Lunch is another growth opportunity for Olive Garden. In the third quarter, they'll refresh their signature unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks offer. And in the fourth quarter, they will introduce a new value-oriented lunch offer. Olive Garden has begun the final phase of testing their Via Tuscany! remodel program for the 430 non-Tuscan farmhouse restaurants in their system. Now this remodel incorporates interior and exterior design elements from their Tuscan farmhouse prototype and provides an updated and more unified look and feel for their family of local restaurants. They plan to complete 20 to 25 remodels in the first quarter after which we will read the results, and assuming that same-restaurant guest count growth target of 3% to 4% is achieved then we'll begin an aggressive rollout in the second half of fiscal 2013 with plans to complete this system by the end of fiscal 2015.","Finally, Olive Garden will maintain strong new unit growth in fiscal 2013 with plans to open 35 to 40 net new restaurants.","Red Lobster business fundamentals continue to improve. They delivered same-restaurant sales growth of 4.6% last year, exceeding our estimate for the industry by nearly 340 basis points. Same-restaurant guest counts increased 2.2%, also exceeding our estimate for the industry by 340 basis points. And brand perception also improved with future visit intent, the most important overall measure of brand perception, and several individual brand health attributes showing significant improvement versus last year.","Red Lobster's biggest opportunity going forward is to continue building same-restaurant guest counts, which are still roughly 15% below where they were 10 years ago. And the biggest near-term priority for profitable guest count growth is to improve affordability.","To help improve affordability for their current core guest space, Red Lobster will continue the emphasis on price certainty and competitively differentiated offers in a majority of their promotions this year.","Red Lobster is currently promoting a $14.99 Four Course Seafood Feast. This promotion was specifically designed to attract price-conscious guests with a very accessible $14.99 price point and do so at a margin that contributes to profit growth in absolute and percent terms with appropriate guest count growth. This is the same promotion we featured last year that was enormously successful. While we don't expect to grow same-restaurant guest counts versus last year since we are up against the very significant increase we achieved last year, we do expect this promotion to be more profitable for guests this year because of lower seafood costs.","During the second quarter, Red Lobster will introduce the most comprehensive core menu change at the brand in the last decade. They've been working on this menu transformation for nearly 2 years to ensure that it's compelling for their guests, can be executed at a high level consistently by operations and contributes to profitable guest count growth. This menu will offer significantly more items with price points below $15. The menu will also help eliminate the veto vote by significantly increasing the number of non-seafood selections.","Similar to Olive Garden, Red Lobster plans to support this menu introduction with national media that will help build awareness and generate incremental visits especially from guests who have stopped coming to Red Lobster.","Red Lobster also plans to further leverage their Real People advertising campaign, which was introduced last year and designed to complement promotional messaging with specific examples of how the Red Lobster experience has improved, especially around affordability, freshness and wood-fire grilling to help eliminate perceived visit barriers and make the brand relevant for new guests and new occasions over time.","The successful Bar Harbor remodel program will continue with plans to remodel approximately 175 restaurants this year. We anticipate 75% of the chain will be remodeled by the end of fiscal 2013, and the entire program will be complete by the end of fiscal 2014. In addition, Red Lobster plans to invest incremental media support behind new Spanish-language advertising starting in the third quarter to build their business with bicultural Hispanics on a national scale. Red Lobster will maintain modest new unit growth in fiscal 2013 with plans to open 1 to 3 net new restaurants.","LongHorn Steakhouse performance remains strong. In particular, same-restaurant sales have now exceeded our estimate of industry performance for 14 consecutive quarters, and new units continue to significantly exceed their value-creation hurdle. As a result, LongHorn plans to accelerate new unit growth in fiscal 2013, opening 44 to 48 net new restaurants, approximately 1\/2 of these openings will be in new markets.","In addition, LongHorn has strengthened their leadership development efforts to ensure a strong talent pipeline is available to support elevated new unit growth. They're also implementing new systems to ensure their operational performance in existing restaurants remains strong.","Given elevated guest demand for affordability, LongHorn will feature attractive price points in a majority of their promotions this year. LongHorn is currently promoting their fire-grilled steaks promotion, which features a bacon-wrapped sirloin for $11.99 and a new fire-grilled flatiron steak for $12.99. This promotion is also supported with an additional flight of national cable media compared to last year.","To help further strengthen brand equity and differentiation within the category, during the second quarter, LongHorn will introduce a new menu design, distinctive new steak offerings and a new advertising campaign that more effectively communicates their passion for delivering a great steakhouse experience with a little more attitude than the current campaign, which we believe will help further differentiate the brand.","Now before Gene reviews the Specialty Restaurant Group, I also wanted to mention that pricing during fiscal 2013 at all 3 of our large casual dining brands will be slightly below 2% to help strengthen affordability and protect the strong value proposition we offer our guests. We anticipate total check growth will be slightly above 2%. And to help maintain our strong business models, we have plans in place to eliminate an additional $25 million in costs during fiscal 2013. This will be accomplished through a combination of ongoing incremental cost reduction efforts driven by running the business closer to current standards and transformative cost reduction efforts that fundamentally change how we support our restaurants and operate the business going forward. Gene?","Eugene I. Lee","Thanks, Drew. Specialty Restaurant Group delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter, growing sales 26.9%. This growth was a result of the strong performance at our 23 net new restaurants across the group, which includes the 11 Eddie V's restaurants we acquired last November and blended same-restaurant sales growth of 2.7%.","Our sales growth resulted in significant operating margin expansion during the quarter. In fact, restaurant level margins improved significantly for the group throughout fiscal 2012, and we continue to leverage our support platform to reduce G&A as a percentage of sales.","Total annual sales for the group exceeded $620 million. That's an increase of more than 24% over prior year and contributed to 24% of Darden's total annual sales growth for the year. This robust sales growth was driven by annual blended same-restaurant sales growth of 4.6%, building on an already competitively superior average unit volumes of $6.4 million for the group. We believe that Specialty Restaurant Group is well positioned to continue building on this momentum in fiscal 2013. Our key priority remains effectively managing accelerated new restaurant growth while maintaining operational excellence, ensuring our brands and business models continue to improve and remain vibrant.","In fiscal 2013, we plan to open 14 to 16 net new restaurants, including 78 Seasons 52s, 3 to 4 Bahama Breezes, 3 Capital Grilles and 1 Eddie V's. At the same time, we are continuing to build the real estate pipeline for each of our brands, including making significant progress on identifying potential sites for Eddie V's future expansion.","As we accelerate growth, maintaining a sufficient talent pipeline will also be critically important, and our operations and human resources teams will be intently focused on that this year.","In addition, to continue our same-restaurant sales momentum in fiscal 2013, we will focus on further elevating the guest experience along with growing all sales channels including group and event dining, as well as national account relationships and continue to broaden the appeal of our menus. We will also leverage our culinary expertise and strong seasonal and regional culinary platform to drive food and beverage innovation that help offset the higher beef costs.","We are confident that Specialty Restaurant Group has what it takes and is working on the right things to achieve the high end of our long-range growth targets of 17% to 20% and continue to add more economically resilient guests to the Darden portfolio.","Now I'll hand it back to Brad for the fiscal 2013 financial outlook.","C. Bradford Richmond","Thanks, Gene. Our outlook for fiscal 2013 reflects our very strong business model in the face of what we expect to be a below-normal economic growth levels. In fiscal 2012, we generated $762 million in cash flow from operations in what was a challenging economic environment, and we anticipate generating even stronger cash flows from operations in fiscal 2013, driven by the combination of continuing same-restaurant sales growth, accelerating new unit growth and an improvement in our operating margins.","And after investing in our business, we plan to return a meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders through the increase in our dividends, which we announced today and by continuing share repurchases.","In fiscal 2013, our outlook is based on combined same-restaurant sales growth for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse of between plus 1% and plus 2%. This includes pricing that is estimated to be slightly below 2% for fiscal 2013 and our assumption that, together, traffic and mix changes will be flat to slightly negative. Of course, we will be both above and below this assumed range from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter depending on promotional calendar, holiday shifts and changing consumer sentiment.","Looking ahead to unit growth, new restaurant plans that Drew outlined plus 4 additional Synergy restaurants means that we expect a net new restaurant increase of approximately 100 to 110 restaurants, which is between 5% and 5.5% unit growth on our current base. Given our same-restaurant assumptions and new restaurant plans, we anticipate that the total sales increase for the year will range from plus 6% to plus 7%.","With more unit development in fiscal 2013 and our accelerating remodel program at Red Lobster and Olive Garden, we expect capital spending to be somewhat higher than fiscal 2012 levels. We anticipate it will be approximately $750 million, which compares to $640 million in fiscal 2012. Included in this capital spending estimate is an incremental $15 million to $20 million dedicated to information technology platform enhancements that will increase sales in coming years.","Looking at operating profit margins from continuing operations, we expect margin expansion of approximately 20 to 40 basis points on a full year basis compared to fiscal 2012 results. On a percentage of sales basis, we expect to see favorability from food and beverage expenses in the first half of the fiscal year as we wrap on elevated inflation that we experienced in the first half of fiscal 2012. But this will begin to level out in the second half of the fiscal year.","We anticipate lower restaurant labor expense and restaurant expenses as a percentage of sales this fiscal year from same-restaurant sales leverage and our transformational cost savings initiatives.","Selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation expense are expected to be higher on a percentage of sales basis due to increases in media expense associated with media inflation and an increase in TRPs, particularly at LongHorn Steakhouse and the increase in total units and remodels.","Looking at food costs more specifically, with decreasing commodity prices and our supply chain-related cost savings initiatives, we expect food and beverage expenses to be lower as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2013. We anticipate food cost inflation to be in the lower half of the plus 0.5 to plus 1.5 range that we disclosed in our Analyst Meeting in February.","We have many of our approximate -- many of our products, approximately 67% of our total spend, contracted through the end of calendar 2012, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. We also have about 6 months of full visibility on our costs. There's limited coverage beyond calendar 2012 in part because we believe some commodities will experience cost declines from the current levels and we want to be in a position to benefit from that decline, or because the premiums for future contracts are simply too great compared to what we expect prices will be in the cash market several months from now.","In terms of specific food items, total seafood prices for fiscal 2013 are expected to be lower than fiscal 2012 because of additional supply, particularly shrimp and crab, and weaker global demand, in particular for lobster. Seafood costs -- seafood accounts for approximately 30% of our total cost of goods sold. Category-by-category, shrimp is our highest volume protein, and we have coverage through the second fiscal quarter of 2013 at prices lower than fiscal 2012. Crab is contracted or purchased at prices lower than fiscal 2012 with the coverage through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. And we currently have lobster usage contracted or purchased through the second quarter of fiscal 2013 at prices that are also lower than the prior year.","Beef prices are higher on a year-over-year basis, and we have approximately 70% of our usage covered through the calendar year 2012.","Chicken poultry market prices are slightly higher on a year-over-year basis, but we have contracted our usage through December of 2012 at prices slightly elevated to our fiscal 2012 cost levels.","Wheat prices are lower on a year-over-year basis. We have contracts that take us through December for our bread products and contracts on our pasta products that expire this fall. We expect that bread and pasta contracts will be renewed at prices slightly better than what we are experiencing as we begin the North American harvest in August and September.","Dairy prices are lower on a year-over-year basis driven by the higher production and weak export markets. For dairy products, more than half of our usage for the calendar year is contracted at prices lower than fiscal 2012 costs.","Energy costs are expected to be favorable on a year-over-year basis. We have contracted nearly 50% of our natural gas and electricity usage through the fall and the deregulated markets in which we operate at prices favorable to calendar 2011. And we are optimistic about adding additional coverage.","We anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, will be relatively higher compared to the prior year. This is because of increased media as Drew previously discussed and media inflation in the upper single-digit range along with normalized incentive compensation levels.","Incentive compensation, which is located in both the restaurant labor line and the SG&A line of the P&L, was below normalized level throughout fiscal 2012 with reduced, and in some cases, 0 bonus payouts based on performance. In fiscal 2013, incentive compensation is reset to targeted levels limiting our EPS growth by $0.14 per diluted share.","Finally, for fiscal 2013, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 26% although this will vary by quarter depending on the timing of certain tax events.","Again, we expect to generate solid cash flow in fiscal 2013, which we've done consistently since we became a public company in 1995 and to use this to pay our increased dividend and to repurchase shares. We expect to pay out approximately $255 million in dividends to our shareholders, an increase of approximately $30 million from fiscal 2012. We also expect to repurchase approximately $200 million to $250 million of our stock in fiscal 2013 while maintaining the debt leverage ratio in the middle of our targeted range.","With our same-restaurant sales assumptions, new unit -- our new restaurant unit growth plans and cost expectations, we anticipate that reported diluted net earnings per share growth from continuing operations for fiscal 2013 will be between 8% and 12% compared to our reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.58 in fiscal 2012.","Overall, we remain confident that this year, we'll deliver strong results in what's likely to be a sluggish growth economic environment.","And now Clarence has some final words.","Clarence Otis","Yes, to wrap up, as you all know, the competitive environment's been tough with a frustratingly slow economic recovery that's constrained consumers. And like other leaders in our industry, we're responding to this reality with significant changes in what we offer our guests and how we communicate what we offer.","Within our portfolio, Olive Garden got off to a later start in making these changes, but still our double-digit growth in earnings per share in the fourth quarter and second half, once an unusual food cost spike was behind us, indicates that we can deliver strong financial performance even when part of our portfolio is not where we'd like it to be. As discussed, material changes are underway at Olive Garden that will strengthen its guest experience and promotional offerings, and we're working on the right things to sustain momentum at the rest of our brands.","We continue to believe that we've got an opportunity to deliver compelling financial value over the next 5 years beginning with solid sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2013. It's a year in which we do expect continued recovery though the improvement in economic and industry conditions is likely to be a lot slower than any of us would like.","We're confident though that with a relentless focus on building guest loyalty and on leveraging and enhancing both our expertise in our increasingly cost-effective support platform that we'll navigate that environment well.","With that, we've got about 30 minutes to take your questions. We know we've run a little longer given that it's a fiscal year end. So let's get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from David Palmer from UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I think investors will want color on your targets given the growth rates as you exited fiscal '12. So just a series of small, little questions asking those colors -- that color on the sales. For instance, what sort of industry-wide casual dining chain same-store sales performance do you think it's consistent with your 1% to 2% guidance? Also on sales, could you provide a little color about Olive Garden versus the other chains? Is your belief that Olive Garden will be in line with the 1% to 2% target for fiscal '12? And lastly, first half versus second half, it feels like the first half sales from some of the comments you are making, even though you have some bridge-type marketing with Olive Garden, the first half might be weaker than your target, particularly with the industry environment we saw through May, but the margins may be better than you might have in the second half, perhaps making the EPS growth at or above your targets in the first half, which a below average or below targeted same-store sales.","Clarence Otis","And I'll start. Just on the industry, we think the industry conditions are going to look a lot like they were in fiscal 2012 and we think the overall economic environment is going to look a lot like that. And so in 2012, we are in an industry that grew at about 1.2% on a same-restaurant sales basis. We think about 1% is a right number. It could be a little bit below that, but that's where we are. In terms of Olive Garden in our mix, as we think about that 1% to 2%, we do expect growth at Olive Garden. And so move it from a decline in fiscal 2012 to growth in fiscal 2013. In terms of the other questions?","Andrew H. Madsen","Well, just a little more color on Olive Garden. We're not anticipating any sort of first half to second half hockey stick for Olive Garden we think in the first half, the promotions are going to be meaningfully stronger than they were last year. In first half of fiscal 2012 same-restaurant sales were minus 2.5% to minus 3%. For instance, we think more single-minded focus on affordability in the promotion that starts Monday, the 2 for $25, is going to be much stronger than the carbonara ravioli promotion last year that it\u2019s lapping. And by the same token, we think the new menu that's going to be introduced in the third quarter with more elevated focus on everyday affordability and advertising behind that will help maintain momentum throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about Red Lobster, which was meaningfully below its prior run rate. With traffic down 7% to 10% every month for the full quarter, I mean I know you guys explained some of your thoughts as to why, but that's a really big decline. And I guess help us understand why we shouldn't be a little bit more worried about that.","Clarence Otis","Well, I think we talked about it. Really March is when we saw the spike in consumer -- in gasoline prices. As we talked about before, that initial spike is something that matters. It does affect behavior. That starts to dissipate over time. And so we've got a premium price promotion that's timed to Lent, so March was the right time. It actually began at the very end of February and so it's just -- it was not well suited for that environment. In April is where we had some fairly significant year-over-year calendar sort of shifts and so you have to adjust April for that. But April was a better month as some of that consumer concern dissipated. And then we saw the consumer get a lot more cautious in May and that was not just at Red Lobster, but across the restaurant industry and really as we look out at the data that we get generally across the overall consumer environment beyond restaurants.","Andrew H. Madsen","And certainly the industry softened in May as Clarence just talked about. But stepping back from that and thinking about Red Lobster specifically, we think the results in the fourth quarter demonstrate really the heightened need for affordability that most consumers have in casual dining, particularly the Red Lobster core guest and that is why we've been working so hard over the last year, not just on promotions, but on a core menu that we think makes a meaningful difference in price point accessibility every day for guests. And without dimensionalizing that too much, it's a substantial change in terms of the balance of items on the menu are $15 or below, which we've determined to be sort of a threshold point for affordability for high-quality seafood in casual dining. And that's why we're adding media support starting in the second quarter to tell people about this new menu. So promotions can help address that to a degree, but this core menu transformation, we think, will also help it in addition to the other things we're doing to maintain sales momentum, remodels, new advertising campaigns, service improvements, et cetera.","Clarence Otis","And then the final thought would just be, as Drew said, I mean we look at a lot of different measures of brand strength and Red Lobster has been improving on all of those. That improvement drove a significant success in the first 3 quarters of the year. So as we look back on the first quarter, same-restaurant sales growth of nearly 11%, almost 7% in the second quarter, a third quarter that had some favorable weather but was still 6%. And so we do think that as we look at the fourth quarter, it's attributable to some very specific promotional dynamics.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then on Olive Garden where traffic was down quite a bit in May, decelerated a whole lot. You mentioned the promotions, but also mentioned that part of it was your decision not to advertise for 2 weeks during Mother's Day. Can you help us understand why you made that decision, why you didn't advertise during that period and what your plans are in terms of ad spending for Olive Garden in fiscal '13? Are you going to be maintaining or increasing TRPs? Is there going to be any sort of phasing shifts we should be aware of in terms of the timing where advertising won\u2019t come until the back half to coincide with initiatives that are coming? Or how do we think about the ad spending behind the brand?","Clarence Otis","Yes. Historically, Olive Garden hasn't advertised around Mother's Day. They did last year, but historically they typically don't. And the thought is it's so busy around Mother's Day that we'll target our advertising support for other periods during the year. And as I talked about in the current environment with the competitive challenges, that probably wasn't the right decision. For fiscal 2013, Olive Garden is going to continue to have one of the strongest media budgets in casual dining and it's going to be -- it's comparable in terms of absolute weight to what it was in fiscal 2012. It'll be up a little bit in dollars because the media inflation is going to be up and we're going to get, we think, more impact from that media investment because we're going to be, in the near term, more single-minded on affordability in several promotions. We're going to have a new campaign starting in the second quarter that we think is going to be a little less expected and is going to break through a little more effectively. And then starting in the third quarter, we're going to have some advertising support behind a new menu with more everyday affordability that we think is going to resonate with Olive Garden guests as well.","Eugene I. Lee","And I think as Brad mentioned when you look at Red Lobster and LongHorn, we do expect increasing rate, and so increased number of TRPs at LongHorn, increased weight at Red Lobster as Drew said. They've been working for a couple of years now to very significantly transform their core menu with a focus on affordability and introducing more price-accessible offerings. And so to drive awareness of that menu, they're going to launch with fairly significant weight behind it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So question is, is what really is giving you this high confidence level in the future, the success of future promotions at Olive Garden, just given the weakness of some -- of the most recent ones. I mean, have the upcoming promotions tested better than Tuscany did, or if you could just please help investors understand the reason for the high confidence just related to the future success of these Olive Garden promotions, and then I have a quick follow-up.","Eugene I. Lee","Yes, I would say a lot of the confidence is driven by a couple of things. One is that as we've made this transition, Olive Garden has had promotions that worked really well. And so in the second quarter, for example, we had a promotion that worked quite well for us. And even in the fourth quarter, we had some success with one of the promotions not as much with one of the others. We think that there will be variability as we make the transition. As I said, there'll be less variability as we continue to learn. The second reason for our confidence level is that we've made this transition before with Red Lobster and with LongHorn Steakhouse. And again, the results in fiscal 2012 for Red Lobster on a same-restaurant sales basis with fairly significant increases through the first 3 quarters, a 4.5% increase for the entire year, this transition was -- certainly contributed to that.","Andrew H. Madsen","And the only other thing I'd add is that we're adjusting the balance in our promotions, as I said, to be more single-mindedly focused on affordability at Olive Garden just in starting this year just like we did a year ago -- a little more than a year ago at Red Lobster, which we think is going to resonate very strongly in current environment. And the testing that we've done on the 2 for $25 offer that starts next week is substantially stronger than the carbonara ravioli promotion that it's going to be lapping from a year ago in the first quarter.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","But what really went wrong with the Taste of Tuscany?","Clarence Otis","I think it was we were emphasizing the interest and excitement and imagery of Tuscany more than we were emphasizing the affordability of the new dishes, and that balance while it might help build the brand over the long term is less impactful in the near term when more guests are looking for affordability. And so a 2 for $25 promotion is a very different message than Taste of Tuscany.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a couple of questions as well. Can you talk about the wisdom of proceeding with the Olive Garden expansion as you're making these major adjustments to the brand?","Andrew H. Madsen","Yes, and I would say as we look at new restaurant performance, so we've got a hurdle that those new restaurants have to achieve in order to deliver an appropriate return on capital, a value-creating return. Olive Garden from an earnings perspective, its new restaurants are delivering earnings at 150% of our hurdle rate. And so new restaurants are performing at a pretty high level. So we feel good about continuing to expand.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, yes, just a question also just on kind of the progression of your expectations for the quarter. You've had a pretty typical first quarter track record in recent years, and this one looks a little trickier than most. You've got a July 4 shift from Monday to Wednesday, you've got the Olympics. This is a time I would suggest to be as transparent as possible about the first quarter. It sounds like Red Lobster and Olive Garden are both off to a bad start in June based on your comments. Just talk us through the first quarter versus the full year guidance.","Andrew H. Madsen","Yes, I think, Joe, we'll stick with the full year. I mean what we've learned over the last several years is that there's tremendous variability across the year, and so you had really strong sales results at Red Lobster first quarter last year, weak earnings results because of the variability in food costs. So you got variability in food costs, you got variability in consumer sentiment and so we think we're pretty comfortable with the annual outlook. Calling that from quarter-to-quarter gets more difficult and we think it's probably not helpful.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can I just ask that maybe, just a broad sense, you think that July 4 shift is positive or negative and do you think the Olympics matter?","Andrew H. Madsen","Well, I mean, the Olympics matter from a media planning perspective, a little expensive. The holiday shifts, it depends on consumer sentiment as much as anything else as to whether they matter or not, so that one\u2019s a little more difficult to project.","Operator","Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 questions actually. First, on -- broadly on the Olive Garden turnaround. I'm just wondering if you can characterize maybe how you feel about the progress, perhaps putting May aside, which seemed like it was disappointing. But the recent initiatives, the new product news and greater value offerings, would you say they're gaining the desired traction or perhaps would you say the challenges are more or less severe at the brand than you believed just a few quarters ago? And then separately on Red Lobster, you talked about -- I think in the press release, you said competitively strong comps in fiscal '13. Obviously, the bearing\u2019s been volatile in the past. Just wondering how we should think about the comps? I mean you talk about the first quarter being extremely difficult from a comparison standpoint. I think you mentioned you weren't expecting any traffic growth. But even in the fiscal second and third quarter, you're lapping very strong, mid-single digits. So I'm just wondering how you think about Red Lobster through the year relative to the kind of that 1% to 2% for the portfolio.","Andrew H. Madsen","Well, starting with the Olive Garden question, I guess I would ground our response in saying we believe the fundamentals in the business are still very strong so whether that's average unit volume or restaurant level returns, the way new units are performing, it's obviously the opportunity that we're focused on is more consistent same-restaurant sales growth. And the work we need to do to generate consistent same-restaurant sales growth takes some time. And we've been working on that for much of the past year changing promotion strategy, which has had a very strong impact when we did the 3-course meal for $12.95, not as strong in Taste of Tuscany. That has led us to say we need to continue on this new approach of having a different type of platform, but that platform idea needs to be more around affordability and we think that will help us next year. We've also been working on a new ad campaign that we think will break through more effectively, get noticed more readily, won't feel as expected. That's not in the market now. It will be in the market in the second quarter. We think we need to continue to evolve the menu. So beyond promotions, we need new advertising, new menu. We've been working on that core menu. We'll be taking a big step towards the future menu in the third quarter, but we'll have more to do following that. And remodel is important. So we think we're in a position to confirm that we've got the right design, the right investment level and to start accelerating remodels of roughly 430 Olive Garden restaurants starting in the second half. So we think we've identified what we need to do. We're confident in the initiatives that we're preparing to implement next year, and guests will start seeing more and more of it as the year unfolds.","Clarence Otis","And I would say at Red Lobster, we think Red Lobster will have growth in same-restaurant sales in fiscal 2013 on top of the strong growth that they had in fiscal 2012. Certainly, in 2012, a lot of it was driven by much better promotional effectiveness, which reflect several years of work prior to that. As Drew mentioned, this year Olive Garden -- I'm sorry, Red Lobster is rolling out one of the biggest changes in core menu that they've done in at least a decade. 80% of our guests are ordering off the core menu. So that's very important. It is a slower build than a promotion might be, but that is part of the reason why we would expect growth at Red Lobster. We have confidence that the core menu is moving in the right direction. And as Drew just reminded me, there is extra media behind that core menu. So we hoped to get that build a little faster than we might without that.","Operator","Next, we have Jason West from Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, just want to follow up on one of the comments you guys made that you expect the check average to be a little bit better than the pricing. And just want to understand how that takes place given that you are running more value at Olive Garden and a new menu at Red Lobster that has price points that are more in the $15 below emphasis. I would think that would put some downward pressure on check. Just want to understand that comment and how you guys are able to measure the impact as these things roll out.","Andrew H. Madsen","I think the biggest dynamic is that we experienced at all of our large casual dining brands, during 2012 we experienced a meaningful amount of menu mix, negative menu mix. So guests trading down to lower-priced items, ordering fewer appetizers, fewer desserts. And we think that, that step-down is going to moderate during fiscal 2013. So we wouldn't expect that negative trend in guest behavior to continue. And second, internally, we think we've gotten a little smarter in the way we merchandise items and in the way we bring news to the market that can help moderate that as well.","Clarence Otis","And I would say as you look back at fiscal 2012, that smarter that Drew talked about really starts to show up in second half. And so that trading that he talked about was much more pronounced in the first half than it was in the second half as we took steps to address it.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the lower price point items, are those, as in the past, engineered to protect margins or do you feel like you need to offer a little more to the guests in terms of portion size or quality elements that you're not able to trim back some on those areas to protect margins?","Clarence Otis","Yes. No, we're not making a trade-off in quality at all. And the new dishes our guests are finding very compelling. So it's a combination of having new dishes that are a little more accessible from a price point standpoint, additional media and incremental traffic, all of which is going to help maintain.","Andrew H. Madsen","Yes, and the dishes from a culinary development perspective are constructed so that they have margin that we feel pretty comfortable with.","Operator","Next, we have John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Again, getting back to Olive Garden, I mean obviously it's been discussed just the absolute average check of the brand, that the increases that have been taken in pricing over the past decade even to your own admission did begin to make you expensive relative to maybe what customers wanted to pay relative to the peers. So a couple things, and maybe a follow-up on the previous question is I mean how can you defend that average ticket? And it does seem just -- there seems to be a little bit of a disconnect between your prepared remarks and what you talked about doing with the brand and focusing more on value including dinner for 2 for $25 with the idea that the average ticket increases more than the modest amount of price, the 1% to 2% price that you're taking in the quarter. So just give us a sense on -- I mean if you don't mind revisiting it specifically on this promotion of how that average ticket at Olive Garden can go up given the fact that you and the customers seem to both agree that it has gotten a little bit expensive. And secondly, whether that increase in the average check can be accomplished permanently through something like dinner for 2 for $25 if that's going to be your permanent option.","Andrew H. Madsen","Yes, I think in our prepared comments we may have given you the impression that the difference between pricing and check is significantly greater than it really is. So our pricing is very modestly below 2%, and our check growth is very modestly above 2%. So essentially, we're expecting our check growth to equal pricing this year. And when you think about a 2 for $25 offer, that's $12.50 per guest. By the time you add a beverage, you're at $15.50. You're very close to the Olive Garden's kind of roughly $16 menu average. So it's really a very modest investment in check.","Clarence Otis","And then I would say on the core menu, in a different -- in addition to making changes that really add compelling price-approachable sort of offers, Olive Garden's also working to make sure it adds items that really are seen as extremely high quality at a reasonable price to really continue to resonate with that guest who has the willingness and ability to pay more, and so that dynamic is going on as well inside the core menu.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And understood. And if you don't mind me pushing this a little bit, I mean have you actually tested this in market? I mean do you have the data that supports that you'll be able to support average check, or are we still kind of in the theoretical in doing things in headquarters in a more closed environment?","Andrew H. Madsen","No, the Red Lobster menu has been in the market for several months. The Olive Garden menu is in the market now, and we've got plenty of experience with a promotion like 2 for $25 that would support what I was suggesting before that by the time people add a beverage, you're very close to our average ticket.","Clarence Otis","And I do think, John, you point to a factor here, which is we talk about and we've been talking about for a year, for example, the direction we want to go in but the development times -- the development cycles are fairly extended because we have to develop dishes. We have to test those dishes. We've got to run in-market tests to get a confidence level. And so a significant change like Red Lobster's making has taken 2 years, will have taken 2 years, by the time they introduced their major core menu change. Olive Garden has been working on an even more accelerated basis and so will have taken about a year. So these take time because we feel that, that time is required to really do it right.","Operator","Our next question, and forgive me if I mispronounce the name, Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse.","Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I want to ask kind of a follow-up to one of John's questions here just to make sure I understood it, too. I mean it does sound like there's a lot riding on the Olive Garden menu coming in third quarter, and I think you just said something about the market -- the menu being in market. So just to clarify, have you tested and in maybe a little bit more granular detail maybe how many stores, how long is the third quarter menu been in test, what have maybe you learned from this in terms of like actual impact on sales. Sort of just more details around this test, anything you're willing to give would be really helpful.","Andrew H. Madsen","Well, first of all, I'd say that our confidence in Olive Garden improving same-restaurant sales next year is really driven by several initiatives that will be hitting the market. So it's important to think about a very different promotion strategy with a more single-minded focus on affordability in these -- in the platforms that we advertise, a new advertising campaign and a new menu. In terms of new menu, we've done extensive testing on what sort of dishes consumers are interested in conceptually, both more approachable dishes with more approachable price points and more distinctive dishes for a different consumer, different consumer audience. We've developed and tested those dishes to make sure that people are satisfied when they order them, and now we're testing the combined impact of those new dishes on the menu in the market now. And that's why we're introducing it in the third quarter, not in the first quarter this fiscal year because we want to make sure that guests find it compelling, our operators can execute it at a high level and that combined with the new ad campaign and the promotions that we're talking about, it does contribute to consistent profitable same-restaurant sales growth.","Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","How many restaurants?","Andrew H. Madsen","A couple of markets and 40 or 50 restaurants.","Operator","Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just curious if there's anywhere else outside of that Red Lobster promotion that you mentioned where you felt like the price increase is too aggressive. And I guess on the back of that, if you actually plan on peeling that back a little bit and again if that would apply anywhere else.","Andrew H. Madsen","Well, we had 2 promotions in the fourth quarter at Red Lobster that we think weren't as powerful as they could have been because of affordability. Lobsterfest is just, by nature, a more premium priced promotion and then the Festival of Shrimp is the promotion you're referring to. And it demonstrates the need for balance in our promotions, which we're going to continue to have next year also emphasizes the need for more approachability in prices on our core menu. I think Clarence mentioned this earlier. But if we\u2019re doing at Red Lobster $3.6 million or $3.7 million a unit, 85% plus of that is coming from the base menu. So we need to make sure if we're addressing affordability that, that everyday affordability is available, which is what the second quarter menu introduction is designed to complement in addition to promotion.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a clarification question quickly on the incentive comp that you mentioned. If I heard you correctly, there will be increase in fiscal '13 cost around $0.14. Just curious on the dynamics there considering it looks like you had better control over performance at least in the fiscal '12 year than you're guiding for in fiscal '13. So just any color around that would be appreciated.","Andrew H. Madsen","Sure. And I would say in fiscal '12, we had a very significant cost-reduction initiative on top of some of the transformative cost-reduction initiatives that we've had going multi-year now. And so that is indeed the fact. And the compensation swings reflect people performance. I mean we missed our initial targets for the year fairly significantly and that's reflected in incentives from the top all the way down through the restaurants as we reset to normalized levels with an expectation that we will hit our plan and pay out at normalized levels as you said -- as Brad said, that's worth about $0.15 a share. So fairly significant swing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco from Lazard.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Actually, I got a follow-up on that. I was wondering when you referenced G&A in that normalized -- is FY '11 sort of the growth rate in G&A, is that a normalized period around that 7% or so or 8% growth rate on the G&A line? And then I have a follow-up.","Clarence Otis","Yes, I'll let Brad answer that. I would just say incentive compensation shows up on a number of different line items, and so it's not just in G&A, the in-restaurant, restaurant manager incentive shows up on a different line.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, the additional color I would say is what's going on with the media piece of that in terms of our support cost structure. We continue to get more efficient there. We continue to leverage new unit growth so that puts downward pressure on that as a percentage of sales. There will be that lift on -- going into '13 with incentive piece. And then media, we talked about a little bit more media going in place to support the new menu at Red Lobster. And then we've talked about elevated media inflation is our expectation right now. So those are the real drivers that we see that somewhat, I'd say, when you net all those together, consistent on a year-over-year basis though.","Clarence Otis","And I would also add just a lot of the cost reduction that we did in the fourth quarter is sustaining -- ongoing. And as Brad said, contributes to that continuously cost-effective support platform. We just have time for one more question.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I had a follow-up.","Clarence Otis","Sure.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","With respect to sort of your guidance I guess your top line hasn't changed from the historical pace. Commodity costs are coming down yet the earnings growth of 8% to 12% is below that -- below your goal. I guess is that to then read through that even if top line growth is sort of in line with overall historical pace, the substitution of expansion in place of same-store sales, if this is a pattern, would relegate you sort of the 8% to 12%. I'm wondering if there's something you need to...","Clarence Otis","No, no. Not at all. In fact, if you just take the incentive reset alone, that's worth 4 points of EPS growth. And so that, alone, takes it to 8% to 12% instead of 12% to 16%. So that is probably the biggest factor. We do have, as we said, some investments and some initiatives to drive growth beyond 2013 and that has an effect as well, but not nearly as significant as the incentive reset.","Operator","Our final question will come from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham Research.","Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And my question's on Olive Garden and the 2 for $25 promotion. And of course, we all know there's a lot of 2 for $20-type promotions from competitors out there, so when we think about affordability, can you maybe describe to us if you are -- if and when you're advertising 2 for $25, what is going to be the value -- incremental value component, to cut through the clutter to make people think that, that's a value versus your peers who are probably going to continue to advertise 2 for $20.","Clarence Otis","Yes, I would say Olive Garden offers unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks with their entr\u00e9es and so that will be a clue to the guests, they know it, and we will reinforce that, that first course is on us.","Andrew H. Madsen","That's the fundamental difference. In the 2 for $20 offers that are out there, it's 2 entr\u00e9es and an appetizer typically. This is 2 entr\u00e9es, an appetizer or a dessert plus unlimited soup or salad and breadsticks at the start of the meal. And when we tested -- we've changed our testing methodology conceptually to reflect the fact that it's just a much more promotional environment. So in addition to getting a sense for how these concepts and promotion platforms rank against what we've done historically, we've also added a number of competitive benchmarks into our testing. And the 2 for $25 that includes unlimited soup and salad in addition to an appetizer or dessert and 2 entr\u00e9es is statistically more compelling than the competitive options out there.","Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Great. And my one follow-up is just on the new core menu at Olive Garden. I thought it was coming out in the fiscal second quarter. I just want to make sure it's now the fiscal third quarter. Were there any, if it was a delay, can you discuss why it was pushed back a bit?","Andrew H. Madsen","Well, it's not really pushed back. We've been thinking about introducing it in the second or third quarter for some time. And so now with where we stand in development and getting a read in market, we're more comfortable with the third quarter.","Matthew Stroud","We'd like to thank everybody for joining us today in the call.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in today's call.

After the prepared remarks, we'll open the call for your questions.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we review our third quarter performance and share the exciting news of our acquisition of Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen.","Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our performance during the quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.88 billion an increase of 1.7%. Same restaurant sales grew 0.9%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden by 510 basis points and diluted net earnings per share were $1.32 an increase of 9.1% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share.","Olive Garden had another impressive quarter, achieving same restaurant sales growth of 1.4%, outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 560 basis points. This was Olive Garden's 10th consecutive quarter same restaurant sales growth, driven by our focus on operational excellence, was drove all-time guest satisfaction scores, continue to meet our guest needs for convenience with OG To Go and providing compelling promotional and core menu offers such as Never-Ending Classics and our taste of the Mediterranean platform.","LongHorn Steakhouse's same restaurant sales grew 0.2%, the 16th consecutive quarter of growth. I am pleased with their results as the team continues to implement their long-term strategy, focused on investing in quality and simplifying operations.","Our success in our ability to continue fulfilling our mission is due to our competitive advantages, our back to basics operating philosophy and our portfolio of differentiated brands. We believe our four competitive advantages give our brands an edge in the marketplace by enabling us to drive sales growth and expanding margins and they are leveraging our significant scale to create cost advantages, using our extensive data and insights to better understand our guest and effectively communicate with them, ensuring our brand systematically go through our rigorous strategic planning process and cultivating our results-oriented people culture to create a team as a passion to serve and a desire to win.","Our operating philosophy is the driving force behind the way our branch teams lead their restaurants. Though simple, this philosophy is powerful because it demands that we remain incredibly focused on driving strong operating fundamentals and that means we're laser focused on culinary innovation and execution inside each of our brands, delivering attentive service to every one of our guests and in creating an engaging atmosphere inside all of our restaurants and these priorities are supported by smart and relative integrated marketing programs that resonate with our guest.","All of this, are competitive advantages, our operating philosophy and our portfolio brings me to the exciting announcement of our acquisition of Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. When you look at all these things, you see why Cheddar's is strong brand on its own, is an excellent fit for our company.","The addition of Cheddar's to the Darden portfolio further enhances our scale. Our significant skill provide meaningful synergies for Cheddar's, further strengthening an already robust business model. Additionally, being part of Darden provides Cheddar's the opportunity to leverage all of our competitive advantages to help increase sales and margins at existing restaurants and drive disciplined, profitable new restaurant growth.","In addition to the mutual benefit realized through scale, we're also extremely confident about this acquisition because Cheddar's and Darden's are a cultural fit as well. We're focused on the same operating priorities. This focus on food, service and atmosphere has enabled Cheddar's to become one of the top brands in casual dining, one known for its high quality, made from scratch food at compelling prices in a polished yet warm atmosphere.","We believe Cheddar's is a strategic fit for Darden for several of the reasons. First, it complements our portfolio and allows us to compete in the undisputed value leader in full-service varied menu category. This category remains sizable with evolving preferences that Cheddar's satisfies.","Additionally, Ian has built an experienced management team that encourages and empowers service-minded team members to be passionate and to bring the distinctive personalities to their roles, so they can deliver a personalized experience that is authentic and attentive.","Next, the restaurant level economics are very attractive. Cheddar's has average restaurant volumes of 4.4 million, average restaurant guest counts of approximately 6,300 guests per week and an average check of approximately $13.50, all of which helps provide a strong return on investment and with only 165 restaurants today, the significant runway for growth.","And finally, Cheddar's is an incredibly strong brand. In fact, it is the undisputed leader on value perception and intent to recommend, which are both leading indicators of same restaurant sales growth.","Now I'll turn it over to Rick, who will discuss the financial details of the quarter and this transaction.","Rick Cardenas","Thanks Gene. We delivered another strong quarter with diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.32, an increase of 9.1% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. Looking at the P&L for this quarter as a percentage of sales, food and beverage was favorable to last year related to commodities deflation of approximately 0.8% and continued cost savings.","Restaurant labor was favorable, driven by lower manager incentive pay, given last year's strong performance in the third quarter. This was partially offset by continued hourly wage rate inflation pressure. Restaurant expenses were unfavorable due to higher than anticipated utilities inflation, particularly natural gas, increased preopening related to more second ever openings this year than last, increased credit card fees and Worker's Compensation and public liability claims.","Marketing was unfavorable due to year-over-year timing and is flat on year-to-date basis through the third quarter. G&A was favorable due to lower management incentives than last year, as we wrap on a strong Q3 in fiscal 2016.","And finally, taxes were favorable due to year-over-year tax timing. Specifically, we had some tax favorability move into the third quarter this year that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Second profit is not comparable to last year and the impacts of the real estate transactions are now in both year's results.","This quarter, Olive Garden segment profit was below last year -- profit margin was below last year, driven by marketing expense timing, utilities inflation and higher preopening expenses related to Q3 and Q4 openings this year versus none in the second half of last year. LongHorn segment profit margin was below last year, driven by higher restaurant expenses, primarily the Workers Compensation expenses I mentioned. All other segments showed growth in segment profit this quarter.","Turning to our outlook in fiscal 2017, we increased our expectations for diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $3.95 and $4 a share. This assumes total sales growth of approximately 2.3% for the full fiscal year, same restaurant sales of approximately 1.5%, commodity deflation for the full year, although we expect the fourth quarter to show slight inflation.","Overall inflation of approximately 1.5% driven by wage inflation for the year of approximately 3.5% to 4% and finally an effective tax rate between 25% and 26% for the year. So, this implies fourth quarter results of same restaurant sales between 2% and 3%, an effective tax rate of between 25% and 26% compared to approximately 21% in last year's fourth quarter and earnings per share between $1.11 and $1.16.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, I want to inform you that we will discontinue disclosing our monthly same restaurant sales results in our quarterly releases beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This change is due to the significant variability in month-to-month sales results, due to weather, promotional calendar shifts and holiday shifts, among other things that generally resolve throughout the quarter.","In 2018, we anticipate total capital spending of between $360 million and $400 million of which $150 million to $175 million is related to growth new restaurant openings of between 30 and 35 and the remainder being related to approximately 100 Olive Garden remodels, ongoing restaurant upkeep, technology and other spending.","The outlook for fiscal 2017 and the ranges for fiscal 2018, CapEx and new restaurant estimates, exclude any impact from the acquisition of Cheddar's. Additional guidance for fiscal 2018 will be shared in next quarter's release and call towards the end of June and will include the impact of Cheddar's.","Regarding the acquisition of Cheddar's, we have signed a definitive agreement to purchase the company for $780 million in an all-cash transaction from private equity firms L Catterton and Oak Investment Partners. Net of approximately $30 million of certain cash tax benefits of deductible goodwill from Cheddar's purchase of a franchisees assets in January 2017, this represents a multiple of 10.4 times Cheddar's trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.","We will also pay the seller $10 million for certain tax attributes related to their deductible transaction expenses. In addition, we will reimburse the sellers for capital expenditures they have made on new restaurants expected to open over the next 12 to 18 months. We expect to close the transaction before the end of fiscal 2017.","This addition to our portfolio will enable significant synergies due to the scale advantage Gene mentioned. We have a track record of achieving significant synergies with other transactions with annualized run rate synergies on average of over 5% of revenues in prior acquisitions. This anticipated annualized run rate synergies with this transaction total $20 million to $25 million, representing approximately 4% of Cheddar's trailing 12 month revenues.","We believe the $20 million to $25 million is both achievable and meaningful and we expect to achieve this annualized run rate by the end of fiscal 2019, primarily through administrative and supply chain savings. Given Cheddar's strong business model and meaningful EBITDA, we expect that this transaction will be accretive to our earnings per share by approximately $0.12 in fiscal 2018 and $0.20 to $0.25 in fiscal 2019, excluding acquisition and integrated related expenses of between $25 million and $35 million.","We'll fund this transaction with the proceeds of a new debt issuance and with cash on hand. This issuance is expected to be completed by the transaction closing date. Once the deal closes, our initial focus will be on integrating Cheddar's with minimal disruption of our operations and achieving the synergy estimates we've outlined. We have experience integrating brands from prior acquisitions and we'll apply learnings from those in this transaction.","As I mentioned earlier, we will provide greater detail on our outlook for fiscal 2018 in our earnings conference call in June. However, I want to wrap up by saying that the addition of Cheddar's to our portfolio gives us even more confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term value creation framework we have discussed previously.","We also intend to maintain our investment-grade credit profile. In addition, the terms and structure of this transaction will put us more in line with our targeted leverage range of 2 to 2.5 times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA.","And with that, I want to welcome Ian and turn it over to him for a few comments.","Ian Baines","Thanks Rick. Well today is a really exciting day for the Cheddar's team as this acquisition is the right next step for us as a brand. Being part of Darden, benefiting from the support structure and expertise in developing brands will enable us to reach our growth potential by opening up new opportunities that were previously out of our reach.","Additionally, it became evident during my interactions with Gene, Rick and the team and at Darden, throughout this process that there are incredible amounts of similarities on how we run our restaurants and lead our teams.","The cultural fit between both parties that Gene discussed will ensure a smooth transition for us and help us to stay focused on delivering exceptional experiences to our guests. We will be stronger because of Darden and I'm confident that we will make a meaningful contribution as part of the company.","Now I'll turn it over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thanks Ian. I just want to close by mentioning that this is the fourth acquisition that I've been a part of at Darden and I've been on both sides of the table. The process can be complex, but we have a seasoned team with a terrific system in place to ensure a smooth integration.","I want to thank Ian and his team for the partnership they have given us through this process and I want to welcome all our new team members from Cheddar's to the Darden family. We're committed to delivering against our mission and I'm extremely excited to continue this journey with the Cheddar's team who will strengthen what is already a very talented team at Darden","And with that, we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank. Sir your line is open.","Brett Levy","Good morning, team. Can you provide us a little bit more color on the Cheddar's P&L what type of seasonality? How you're thinking about growth in terms of company or franchise restaurant level margins and also any thoughts on the near-term with a long-term -- near-term growth targets or the long-term unit potential?","Rick Cardenas","Hey Brett, it's Rick. The restaurant P&L we mentioned is about a 17% restaurant EBITDA, which is strong in the industry. $4.4 million AUV and they\u2019ve got 25 franchises now. The revenues are fairly immaterial to the overall revenues Cheddar's.","And as we mentioned, we have a pipeline -- they've already got a pipeline of about three restaurants in this fiscal year and another eight or so in the next fiscal year. I'd like to just close by saying they\u2019ve grown about 12%, 15% over the last 10 years and we feel really confident in their continued growth.","Brett Levy","Can you share anything about the comp cadence or what they're running, what they generally run in terms of on an annual basis and the comp waterfall for new units as they come out?","Gene Lee","Hey Brett, it's Gene. What I was going to comment on the comp performance historically, I will say that they're outperforming the industry at this time and we'll give you some more insight in June once we get this deal closed.","Brett Levy","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller","Thank you. Good morning and congratulations. Maybe just bigger picture from Cheddar's, what might you deploy into your system in terms of their value proposition or positioning? Also, maybe anything they're doing in technology human capital or otherwise, thanks?","Gene Lee","Yes, we think there's a lot to learn from the value proposition. They're obviously the value leader. You saw the chart that we had in the presentation. They\u2019ve had a long history of underpricing the industry, developing products from scratch, which enable them just to really deliver a high-quality product at a little bit lower price point.","So, I think there's a lot that we can learn from them about value and as far as technology and human capital, I think there's a lot that we can share with them. We're excited to be able to help them with some of their back of the house technology and some of the process oriented things that we've developed here at Darden that over the years, they\u2019ve haven\u2019t had the opportunity to implement.","And we think there's upside plugging them into our human resource systems and we think we can help improve their team member turnover and retention.","Nicole Miller","And just so everybody does have it, what is the approximate average check at Cheddar's?","Rick Cardenas","It's about $13.50.","Nicole Miller","Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Bittner","Thanks, congrats guys on the quarter and the acquisition. Just a big picture, financial creasing question on the deal, you said the transaction will be EPS accretive in year one by about $0.12 and then expanding to $0.20 to $0.25 in your two or 2019.","Is the difference in the accretion projections, simply you're not assuming much synergies in the 18 number and you're assuming all the synergies in the 19 number, or is there some type of growth that you're assuming out of Cheddar's?","Gene Lee","Yes Brian, thanks. We have more of the synergies coming in, in '19 than in '18, although we do expect some growth in Cheddar's in '19.","Brian Bittner","Okay. And then as far as the 2.3 EBITDAR, should we be assuming in our models that you're taking out around $500 million out of your credit facility that you currently have untapped to fund this or should we be assuming more?","Rick Cardenas","Well, what I'd start with if you look at our balance sheet right now, we've got about $390 million in cash. We're not going to talk about the way we're going to fund the debt other than to say we'll use some debt whether it's credit facility or other things to fund this transaction. We expect to close that before the deal closes.","Brian Bittner","Okay. Thanks.","Rick Cardenas","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. Sir, your line is open.","Greg Francfort","Hey guys, just one question on the EBITDA multiple, I know Cheddar's had a 44-store transaction happen earlier this year, you including those stores in the multiple in the EBITDA they're using for the multiple.","Gene Lee","Yes Greg. We're including them for a pro forma for the full, for the full 12 months.","Greg Francfort","Got it. Got it. And then just, I think you guys have been testing loyalty in some markets and is the strategy going forward to potentially acquire more brands and build out sort of a broader loyalty network? I guess how do you think about how Cheddar's fits into plans you're doing and what you're testing on the loyalty front?","Gene Lee","Yes, you're correct. We have a small loyalty test out there right now and as we've said in the past, we're going continue to go slow with that test. And how does Cheddar's fit into that, I think we keep coming back to our four competitive advantages and one of our what we believe is a competitive advantage is our data and insights.","And so, having Cheddar's being able to plug into the resources that -- and capabilities that we've developed with data and insights should be a big advantage for them. It's going to take us some time to be able to get them into our systems, but that we think about the Darden platform and plugging brands into it, we think that gives -- that enables these brands to have a significant advantage in the marketplace.","As far as a strategy to continue to do this, no, let's focus on completing this transaction and grading this brand really, really well and then we'll move on and look at it when that time comes, but that's a long time from today.","Greg Francfort","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, it's Sam Beres of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Sam Beres","Good morning, Gene, I was just hoping maybe in terms of the broader industry, hoping you could maybe share some thoughts on just how you're viewing kind of the underlying demand fundamentals from that industry perspective right now, just given the large amount of noise we're seeing within trends in recent months whether that's from weather, calendar shifts or maybe timing of tax refunds?","Gene Lee","Yeah, I think all those, the things which you just mentioned have played a big impact in the quarter and I continue to urge people to take a little bit longer term approach to this and not getting hung up week-to-week, quarter-to-quarter.","I would say if you look at our industry benchmarks, for the first couple weeks of March, the delay in the tax refunds was an impact in February and we've seen a few, a little bit better trends in the beginning of March. We're also in March dealing with a much later Easter this year than we had last year. So just a lot of noise.","When I think about the consumer, I think the consumer has been pretty steady. We know the consumer is looking for everyday value. The consumer is not reacting to promotional value constructs, the way they did a few years ago and I think that when you give the consumer what it is that they want, they're visiting restaurants.","And I think if you look at our industry, the brands that are performing and executing at a high level that are well-positioned, continue to do fairly well.","Sam Beres","Great. That's helpful and I guess maybe just one follow-up on the implied outlook for Q4 comps of 2% to 3% does assume a nice pickup from the level your just reported. So, I guess, in terms of the puts and takes on that, what gives you the confidence in delivering that acceleration? Is it just that better trend line that you've seen here recently at the start of March?","Gene Lee","Well, I think it has more to do with the late Easter. Last year we were sitting around the table and talking about why trends slow down with Easter coming forward and this year we'll get the benefits of a later Easter and later Easter helps restaurants and retail.","Sam Beres","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next, is Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Stephanie Ng","Good morning. This is actually Stephanie Ng representing Sara Senatore. Thanks for taking my question. I had a broader question. I just wanted to understand your perspective on the bar and grill category in relation to the acquisition. This category has been one of the weaker casual dining categories over the last couple of years, warranting to deflationary pressures and competition from limited service.","Why expand your portfolio to this category and why now and also if you could talk about your longer-term view on the bar and grill category, that would be great. Thanks.","Gene Lee","Yes, first, we don't consider Cheddar's as a traditionally ubiquitous bar and grill concept. We see this as a differentiated varied menu concept with a totally different footprint and much larger buildings, 300 seat restaurants, much more broadly appealing and we see Cheddar's in a segment that we've defined as the place where brands are winning and we see Cheddar's competing against Cracker Barrel, Texas Roadhouse and to some degree Olive Garden in a segment that has got a very broad audience and is very appealing to lots and lots of people.","And so, we don't think of this as bar and grill. Sometimes it gets segmented that way, but we see this as a varied menu restaurant and almost the antithesis of bar and grill. When we got scrap -- making all our products from scratch, it's a very broad appealing menu. So, a lot of ribs and stakes and chicken fingers.","This is a full dinner house menu that's competing very, very effectively and if you look at the value ratings on this compared to bar and grill, they're not even in the same quadrant. And so, we think this is the right brand at the right time with a great consumer base to be able to continue to grow this business and its significantly underpenetrated.","Stephanie Ng","Okay. Thank you. And a follow-up, how should we think about implications on the buybacks for the balance of the year and if acquisition would likely to divert some cash?","Gene Lee","Yes, on the terms of buyback, what I would just lead you to is our long-term framework, which is $100 million to $200 million a year and in this fiscal year, we've already bought $200 million. We didn't buy any shares in Q3 because we were in the middle of this acquisition. So, we couldn't be in the marketplace.","But I would just say, this does not preclude us from staying in the $100 million to $200 million range next year, which is our long-term framework.","Stephanie Ng","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Will Slabaugh of Stephens. Your line is open.","Will Slabaugh","Thanks guys. Just a question on Olive Garden, you further widened that gap as you mentioned between you and peers and didn't show that volatility that we've been seeing in the industry. So, I'm curious where you would attribute that success? Where the growth has to go, spending stepped up a little bit this quarter or if you think the promotions there seem to gain more traction on a relative basis. And I'm curious as well if you might comment on LongHorn too.","Gene Lee","Yes, I think there is a couple things going on. I think I'll make a couple comments, I think are both true for Olive Garden and LongHorn and it's a boring comment, but we are maniacally focused on improving how we run our restaurants every single day and our operations teams in both those businesses continue to make significant progress, driven by our goal of simplifying the operation.","My overarching message to all our teams this year is that these businesses have gotten way too complex. We need to continue to simplify and through that simplification, we should execute at a higher level. Now I think both businesses are making some really good decisions and they continue to invest in value. They continue to invest in menu innovation that continues to resonate with the consumer.","Olive Garden is still benefiting from strong to-go presence. That business continues to grow and we're benefiting from that. And LongHorn I think we're starting to see the payback from all the investments that we're making in food as we start to increase the size of our stakes, improve our house salad and some other decisions that we made along the way to improve the overall operation and it's going to take time for those to continue to show themselves, but our consumer research right now in LongHorn has never been better.","We're moving Northeast in our in everything that we do there and I'm really, really excited. So, I think the brands are well-positioned. They're focused on the right things. They're making good -- the leadership is making good long-term decisions in both of those brands and they should continue to win because of those decisions.","Will Slabaugh","And as a quick follow-up, would you mind giving their To Go gross at Olive Garden for the quarter?","Gene Lee","Yes, To Go, grew 17%, so we got a three-year stack of approximately 60% in takeout.","Will Slabaugh","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. I had a couple of questions with respect to trying to better understand the growth potential of Cheddar's in your portfolio. I guess I've been following it a little bit the last couple of years and as far as the overall system growth, I don't think it was at the 15% pay.","So, did I hear you right that you think that this is a 15% growth brand? Is that something that you've seen in the past or is that something that within your portfolio you think you can get to those levels?","Rick Cardenas","Hey Matt, this is Rick. The 15%ish growth rate was over the last 10 years. So, the last few years, they've had a little bit of slowdown in growth. We expect this brand to continue to grow in the category and to grow faster than Olive Garden would grow.","So, we feel really good about their potential. They're at a 140 company-owned restaurants right now with the potential to well exceed that.","Matthew DiFrisco","When it comes into your -- what is the current growth rate now in your perspective, when you bought this, are you looking at this as a you say a strong, obviously faster than Olive Garden, but that's a wide range. Is this better than a better than 5% to 10% growth or even faster?","Rick Cardenas","What I would say is still little early to tell, let us get through acquisition integration and we know that we're going to have a little bit of a slowdown in growth because of the integration and ask what they've got in their unit count and then we'll come back to you later on in this fiscal year to tell you what the growth potential is or the growth rates are.","Matthew DiFrisco","I guess just to better understand what's going to go through that analysis, can you talk about the portfolio? Is it today growth -- is it a diversified, does it diversify your portfolio of real estate? Is this a different location where you would find a Cheddar's in your opinion for the next 140 stores and maybe where a LongHorn or an Olive Garden would go, or is this going to compete for those same type of sites?","Gene Lee","Well it's a two-acre site, so it's very similar to what Olive Garden needs. It's a much bigger site than a LongHorn. So, they probably won't be competing for LongHorn sites and I think we got 835 or so Olive Gardens today.","There are a lot of places that Cheddar's can go. We're already established from an Olive Garden standpoint. So, I don't see any competition for sites. I think what it does from a portfolio standpoint, is it allow us to secure the best real estate in a market and then let us decide which one of our brands that we're going to use to take advantage of that site and that's what's exciting to our real estate team.","Matthew DiFrisco","Okay. And then just a last follow-up question, the outperformance I just want to understand as far as at both LongHorn and Olive Garden, is any of that explained by the later? Are you benefiting more and seeing a seasonality because of the later timing of Easter or something else with the calendar, or is that just pure momentum, the widening of the gap at peer group.","Gene Lee","I am going back to I think where we've been for two and half years focused on running better restaurants and I know it's not sexy. It's not something that people like me to talk about. That's what we're focused on. It's one guest at a time and I would truly believe that we need to focus -- continue to focus on that.","We're winning because our retention rates are great. Our people are excited about what we're doing. They're rewarded appropriately and we're taking care of our guests. When they come in, we're delivering on that promise and when we don't deliver on that promise, we are recovering with our guests both socially and in other ways.","Matthew DiFrisco","Excellent. That clarity is very appreciated. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have David Palmer of RBC Capital. Your line is open.","David Palmer","All right. Good morning. First, just a housekeeping on Cheddar's, the restaurant level margins and overhead as a percent of sales, did you discuss that?","Gene Lee","Yes, we said that restaurant level margin is about 17% of sales. We haven't talked about their overhead, but we'll talk more about that in the June.","David Palmer","Okay. Great. And if you could maybe just a strategic question, what was the institutional learnings do you think from past acquisitions at Darden like Yard House and just a broader point about why Darden is ready for a portfolio approach today when that's been difficult for Darden in the past in certain areas and certainly other companies as well this portfolio approach has proving to be a distraction at some critical point, thanks?","Gene Lee","Well David, I think we've always been a portfolio company. We've had more brands, less brands, more brands. I think that the way we're organized today, we're fairly decentralized on each brand as an operating company present and they have their own team. Unless it's non-consumer facing and we can get some significant synergy out of it.","It's in the brand and it is non-consumer facing. We bring it in and we try to get as much synergy as we possibly can out of it. And I know I pivot back to what we think we do really well at Darden and what we do really well at Darden is enable our brands through a couple ways to succeed in the marketplace.","We think we give them a great scale advantage. We think the data and insights work that we're doing, we think we help them with their strategic planning and we've got an umbrella that enables them to have unique operating cultures inside the brands and yet have these industry-leading retention numbers.","And so as long as we're organized appropriately and we stay decentralized and have great presidents run their businesses, managing the portfolio is really just a management challenge and we got to keep the center small and so that we don't burden the brands but we help the brands compete more effectively in the marketplace and I believe every one of our brands goes to market today with a significant advantage.","As far as what we've learned on past integration, I think we've learned a lot from 10 years ago when we did the rare acquisition through the Eddie V's and Yard House, I think that we'll understand the appropriate speed in which to implement things. We'll be able to prioritize better this time than we did the last time or the time before that.","We know where the potholes are. We're going to use an outside consulting agency to do -- to lead the PMO so that there is less distraction with our internal resources so we can stay focused on the existing businesses. No one from any other brand will have any involvement in the integration at all, so that every brand president we be fully engaged running their business.","And I'll just have a cursory overview of the integration, but I'll be focused on running our businesses day in and day out. So, we have learned things. We'll get better and we'll continue to get better, but we're excited about it and we think we can do this fairly quickly and fairly well.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass","Okay. Thanks very much. Just going back to Olive Garden margin performance this quarter, it wasn\u2019t clear to me, are these timing shifts you think that impacted margins or is there a step up in marketing for samplers as pre-opening is going to be a greater pressure.","So is that another way, do you expect these to go away in the fourth quarter in 2018 or is there some of these pressures here to stay.","Rick Cardenas","Hey John, this is Rick. Yes, the marketing pressure you talked about specifically was timing. Year-to-date we're flat on the marking as a percent of sales and we just had a very strong quarter last year which leveraged our sales in the marketing side.","The other things that we've talked about are generally -- yes, again preopening is one of the big one. So, if you think about what we've had, last year Olive Garden didn't open any restaurants in the back half of the year and we're opening a lot more restaurants in the back half of this year.","So, for Darden, we are opening more -- we expect to open more restaurants in the fourth quarter this year than we open all of last year. So, in Q3 and Q4, a lot of it was preopening differences.","John Glass","Okay. But said another way, some of that would say then right, if you're going to, if you see to open more restaurants.","Rick Cardenas","Yes, some of the preopening, we expect preopening to increase a little bit going forward, but we don't expect our margins to decline year-over-year as we go forward, but we'll talk more about next year in June.","John Glass","Okay. And then just on Cheddar's and the overlap, you mentioned Olive Garden as a competitor that values space. So, what do you know about how you currently trade customers, Olive Garden with Cheddar's and when you look at the physical footprint of the two brands, how much of an overlap now when you study those stores how do you see the impact of a Cheddar's opening for example on Olive Garden.","Gene Lee","Well, we don't see it impacting. This is a variety of seeking category. Obviously, we trade guests with Cheddar's, but we trade with every competitor and so we think that there are two different occasions even though they're both value occasions, we don't see them as a major threat.","Whether we what we own them or not, they're going to open restaurants. So, they're just like any other competitor and that's part of how we have to deal with it internally as our brands have to compete against each other effectively.","John Glass","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Sir, your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Just two quick questions on the broader industry. First one, Gene in terms of the challenges we're seeing for the broader industry, I think you mentioned in your remarks earlier, that you don't think the consumer is reacting to the promotional activity as perhaps they have in the past.","I am just wondering how you frame that versus or how does that differ maybe from Olive Garden's LTOs? I am just wondering how you bucket those two things and whether you're seeing a change in the competitive landscape from those competitors and then I had one follow-up?","Gene Lee","I think where I am trying to go with that is that when you look at every day value, you look at our Cucina Mia offering and Olive Garden, that's grown from 1.5% preference to 10% preference over the last two years and so we're still out there with some promotional messages, but we're not seeing preference on promotional items increase year-over-year.","Now we have some very broadly appealing promotions that we run every single year that our consumer look forward to. They look forward to buy one take. When they look forward to Never Ending Pasta. Never-Ending Classics was a big hit. People look forward to that.","So, we think our promotional cadence is broader than what some other of our competitors are doing where they're forcing you into buying through a construct to get that value, yet their check average continues to increase through mix and pricing.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got it. And then just more broadly when you think about maybe adding another brand, but just in general, in terms of the supply-demand, do you see any change or shift in the dynamic and that's kind of bigger structural headwind that the category is facing, whether you're seeing easing headwinds closing of units or maybe shifting of chambers in industry. Just how you see the industry from a supply-demand standpoint over the next couple of years?","Gene Lee","Yes, there is definitely there has been an over supply for 10 years in our industry and then when you look at their shared takers and the share givers and I think the brands that are really focused on their positioning, understand what they're trying to deliver to their consumer or taking share.","We opened a Yard House today and we traded $8 million in sales. We didn't create $8 million of sales in that marketplace. We took that $8 million from other competitors. And so, the way I think about is do we have share takers or share givers in all of our brands today are our share takers.","And so, I think there is structural headwinds as there are lot of seats our there, but I think that our brands because of our scale and our advantages really have a strong advantage in the marketplace and we're utilizing that once we continue to aggressively manage non-consumer facing costs and put less pressure on pricing, I think we'll continue to take market share.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Jason West of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jason West","Yes thanks. Just a couple housekeeping items I guess on Cheddar's. What is the investment cost per store there and the actual square footage that you guys are targeting on those boxes?","Rick Cardenas","Yes, Jason, this is Rick. The average investment cost is similar to an Olive Garden. So, I'll just go with that. I'm not too different than Olive Garden and not too different than in Olive Garden size. Again, we'll get into more detail on everything about Cheddar's in the June call, but that should give you a good idea.","Jason West","Okay. And then in terms of the cash flow going forward, you mentioned that you do still see room for some buybacks here, but we're obviously adding quite a bit of debt to the balance sheet. So is the plan then not going to be to pay down the debt once the deal is funded and you're cash flowing or you're going to maintain that level of debt going forward unless the EBITDA kind of catch up.","Gene Lee","Yes, Jason, when we finish this transaction, whatever debt we take on, we expect to be well within our 2% to 2.5% adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR. So, we don't think that we have to go down and pay down debt as we continue to grow, but we do expect the EBITDA to continue to help with that, but day one, we would be right smack in the middle of our adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA range of 2% to 2.5% times.","Jason West","Okay. It makes sense. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Karen Holthouse","Hi. Another quick question on Cheddar's, outside of the unit growth outlook, what's just the state of the system in terms of remodels? Is it one that you would expect any increase in near term spending on maintenance or remodels, thanks?","Ian Baines","Hello, this is Ian. One of the great attributes of the brand is that the buildings are built to be timeless. So, they never really have to remodeled. We refurbish to make sure that they're kept in pristine fashion, but because there is no branding etcetera, the building is timeless.","Karen Holthouse","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Howard Penney of Hedgeye Management. Your line is open.","Howard Penney","Hi. Thank you very much. Hi, thank you. I think just by putting all the pieces of the puzzle together today is it opening up at Olive Garden gets a better return on capital than Cheddar's, is that correct based on what you said today?","And then Gene, can you maybe go into little more detail in the pivot to buying brands? I know you went through the rationalization, but I was just curious as to why the acquisition strategy again?","Gene Lee","Okay. Good morning, Howard. It's Gene. Yes, obviously, investment in an Olive Garden would yield you a higher return today than at Cheddar's. However, the opportunity to open Olive Garden is not as plentiful as the opportunity to open Cheddar's and we've got -- we're not fully penetrated with Olive Garden, but we're getting closer and closer and it's getting harder and harder to find locations where it would be -- we could get that return because of cannibalization and other factors.","As far as the rationale and why we think this was the right time to do an acquisition, I think there is a couple things. I think we are really confident in the platform that we have built here in our four advantages and especially the first two around making scale work for us and second, what we're going to -- what we're able to do and going to be able to do with data and insights, as we get all -- get a broader portfolio.","And so, we think that that was one of the reasons that we could plug something into our portfolio and given the advantage in the marketplace. This is a mature industry and we believe that some consolidation makes sense and that's what we're trying to do.","We think that if we get a little bit more scale, we can continue to improve our supply chain, we can improve our use of the data and insights and hope -- and our plan if I plugged into a Darden platform, our brands have an advantage in the marketplace and we can underprice our competitors and we can continue to take market share.","Howard Penney","Thank you for that. I don't mean to compare it to the previous regime, but I think some of -- the platform is there before, but it didn't work. I know this question was asked, but I think it's an important one. The platform has always been there to run multiple brands.","So, your tenure, what's changed or what is different for it to work this time for me not have not been successful last time?","Gene Lee","I think we're much more decentralized today than when we were -- when we were purchased by Darden 10 years ago and I think during that time, there were decisions made right, wrong or indifferent, that they were going to build more capabilities in the center and they made investments in G&A that they believe they needed to make to grow the business.","We're just doing the exact opposite. We're letting the presidents run their businesses and we're focused on where we can get synergies in the middle on these non-consumer facing areas and we're trying to manage and drive down cost. G&A is 4.8 and we're committed to get making further south and we think we can continue to push that forward.","And so, I think that's one of the big differences is just how we're operating. The other thing I would add Howard is that dad is more valuable today and we think that if we can use this data to understand our consumer better, we're actually focusing on a couple other things from a data standpoint that's worked in real well for us from an operational effectiveness.","We think it's going to give us a huge advantage and for us to have all that data, and I think the other big difference organizationally is we're just very operational focused today and we're focused on the day-to-day execution and cost management.","We understand that cost management is going to be extremely important, so that we can continue to put value on the plate for the consumer.","Howard Penney","And then just lastly, is there To Go opportunity with Cheddar's or delivery or take out?","Gene Lee","Yeah, so there is a huge opportunity for To Go and Cheddar's and I think that the management team is just starting to size that opportunity understand what they have to do operationally to be able to deliver on that.","These are extremely busy restaurants with 6300 guests and then adding the To Go component of it, really takes a little bit operational change in their operation and I know management and my initial discussions early on have identified that and they're putting and developing the processes to implement now.","Howard Penney","Thank you for the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Brian Vaccaro of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Brian Vaccaro","Good morning. Just wanted to circle back on the state of the Cheddar's fleet today. I believe the brand underwent a repositioning that reemphasize scratch kitchen's versus a casual caf\u00e9 positioning in the past, but just curious, was there a meaningful remodeling program associated with that shift?","Gene Lee","No, I think that as Ian just said, these buildings are built in a timeless manner, very well thought out. I think the management over the years has done a great job. I think the repositioning under Ian's leadership has really more to highlight and it bring to the forefront all the wonderful things they've done with food over the years.","And I think he's brought a fresh approach to it, and went out did some research, found out what consumers thought of the brand and what did he need to bring to the forefront to highlight all the attributes that the consumer, some consumers were given credit for and some weren\u2019t and I think the teams has done a masterful job with this. I love the positioning and it's on trend, scratch cooking.","Brian Vaccaro","All right. That's helpful. And Gene, you mentioned that Cheddar's has or is outperforming from a comp perspective. Was that sort of last 12 months? Was that the last few years? Can you give any historical perspective there on what you were referencing there?","Gene Lee","No, the only comment, I must stick to my comments. It's been outperforming the industry benchmarks in most recent times and we'll give you a little bit more color once we own this business.","Brian Vaccaro","Okay. All right. Fair enough and then just shifting gears to Olive Garden if I could, I wanted to ask about average check, I noted that mix flattened out a bit or maybe some color on what's driving that? Is that an incremental shift towards value maybe some outperformance at lunch?","And then also, what's your latest thinking around menu pricing at Olive Garden. I noticed that picked up a bit late in the quarter, was that pricing or a change in thinking? Thank you.","Gene Lee","No, it was just, the pick-up in February was driven primarily by some adjustments in To Go pricing. We thought we were a little bit too far on the market with that. So, we ticked up there and especially in the catering piece, we also took some a little bit of pricing on the West Coast in February to offset minimum wage increases.","But our philosophy going forward is we're going to try to drive that down a little bit lower than what it has been historically. I don't want to say too much more about it from a competitive standpoint, but we believe long-term if we can continue to underprice the marketplace, we're going to wake up a few years from now and have a real value gap.","And the only way we can do that is to take advantage of our scale and find cost efficiencies in the rest of the operation.","Brian Vaccaro","Okay. And then on the mix dynamic specifically, was that shift towards value or maybe lunch or something else driving that?","Gene Lee","No. One of them is if you think about our To Go sales aren\u2019t growing nearly as fast as they were before, we're well above '20 we're down to '17. Catering is still driving some of that growth, but a little bit less of it because of To Go and we had some promotional timing shifts. So, it's not anything other than that.","Brian Vaccaro","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","Hi. Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups if I may, Gene, you mentioned we've been oversupplied in the category for 10 years. I wanted to get a sense in the trade areas that you care about whether that's effect of supply growth is slowing down or if it's maintaining the same pace as it was before?","Gene Lee","No. There is definitely less supply growth especially in the mature trade areas just because there is not a whole lot of more room to develop. And so, the dynamic that's going on now is I think the trade areas are getting smaller and people are willing to drive less than they used to.","And so, I think more of us are thinking about how do we bring restaurants closer to the consumer and how do we develop with that mindset, but overall the real mature trade areas today, there is just not a lot of room for development.","John Ivankoe","And one of the ways that some companies are trying to do that is by developing fast casual as opposed to casual dining that is you say needs two acres in some cases to develop. So, what was the thought of going casual dining versus fast casual and is fast casual ever an option for Darden as you foresee it?","Gene Lee","No. I don't see any upside in fast casual. I think it's a very difficult business model and I think there's a lot of growth out there. I am not a believer there's a lot of profitability out there. I think the barriers to entry are really low and I think our goal is how we put the fullback into full service and by doing that making sure that we understand the consumer's need to respect their time and that we're able to provide an extra service experience that is within their time parameters.","And if we can do that for at the same price or sometimes even less than fast casual, we're going to continue to win.","John Ivankoe","And I think you've talked before about having 2% to 3% supply growth in the U.S. for your own concepts. So, does Cheddar's allow you to be on top of that? Will you be within it? Does Cheddar's growth take over maybe some of the other businesses and I think you may have answered that a number of different questions, but\u2026","Gene Lee","I think it's absolutely within the framework. We don't think it gets us over the top of the framework. We think it helps us get solely in the framework.","John Ivankoe","Okay. And the last one, thanks for this speed round, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned commodities actually being up in the fourth quarter of '17, if I heard that correctly, is that the kind of the beginning of another cyclical trend in commodities? What are you currently seeing in the basket?","Rick Cardenas","Hey John, it's Rick. Yes, we did say commodities are expected to be up, buy up ever so slightly in the fourth quarter. Eventually this is going to turn. So, we're not going to talk about '18 yet, but we do see commodities slight inflation this quarter and what we talk about in our presentation, we're about 80% covered.","So, we're, pretty covered for the rest of the year and including 80% in beef. So, we feel pretty good about where our numbers for the rest of this year and we'll talk about '18 in '18.","John Ivankoe","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Todd Duvick of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Todd Duvick","Yes. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just a couple of quick ones. Could you tell us how many of the Cheddar's restaurants are owned and if there is a potential sale leaseback opportunity for these restaurants?","Rick Cardenas","Yes, Todd, this is Rick. All the restaurants are leased. So, there is a potential for a sale-leaseback.","Todd Duvick","Okay. That's helpful. And with the remaining franchise restaurants, can you tell us if the franchisee, well if it's one or multiple franchisees and if they have development rights for future restaurant growth?","Gene Lee","Hey Todd. This is quite a few franchisees not really any development rights other than maybe a couple of them for future growth.","Todd Duvick","Okay. Thank you very much.","Gene Lee","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Steve Anderson of Maxim Group. Your line is open.","Steve Anderson","Yes. Good morning, Just a follow-up on the questions just asked before about the franchise units. Do you foresee any plans to buy back those franchise units given that Cheddar's already had bought back a large franchisee of 44 units, that deal closed back in January?","Rick Cardenas","Hey Steve, it's Rick. That deal was part of right of first refusal that Cheddar's had to buy those franchisees back. It's still little early in the process. Again, we don't want to talk about integration. We're just getting throws of that and what we're going to do with the 25 other franchise restaurants.","Suffice to say there have been some conversation that Ian had yesterday just letting them know that the acquisition is happening, but that's just as far as we're going to go.","Steve Anderson","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Strelzik","Hey. Good morning. I just had two quick ones. On the synergies number, you mentioned 4% of revenues versus over 5% historically. Is there anything structural with respect to Cheddar's that limits that synergy opportunity relative to history, maybe the decentralization that you talked about?","And secondarily, I know over the last 12 to 18 months, there were some Cheddar's unit closures, just wondering what went into that decision and maybe anything that you learnt from a market perspective or a growth perspective, development perspective going forward thanks?","Rick Cardenas","Hey Andrew, the synergies we're seeing 4% of sales. We're just getting in the process of estimating the synergies. We wanted to give you an idea of what we think they could be with some solid numbers. So, we wanted to feel good about the synergies we told you.","If we think there's more as we go through the integration process, we'll let you know, but right now using 4% versus our historical 5%, we think is a prudent thing to do. In regards to some of the closings, as we said, they did have a pretty good growth spur over the last 10 years around 15% growth rate in their company-owned restaurants including Greer.","And they closed about five or six of them couple years ago as their process and that's normal, that's normal in any restaurant company. You have some closing. The good news for us is they already did that, night. So, they\u2019ve gone through the process of looking at their portfolio and they made those closings a couple years ago including a couple of them I think were franchise units.","So, we don't feel that the closings were an issue. We think that was a good thing for us.","Andrew Strelzik","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Chris O'Cull of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Chris O'Cull","Thanks. Gene, it looks like Cheddar's will represent just under 10% of the portfolio's EBITDA. How did its size factor into the consideration and do you expect it to become the third core primary brand in the Darden portfolio?","Gene Lee","Good question, Chris. We wanted to make sure we added something that was going to make a difference for Darden and to help kind of hedge longer-term against Olive Garden and make sure we had a big enough opportunity there.","We look at the opportunity for Cheddar's and we look at the consumer and we look at how it compares to an Olive Garden. We definitely think that Cheddar's long-term will be the number three brand. It could possibly be the number two brand inside the portfolio.","This is a very broadly appealing brand that has a strong, strong reputation in the marketplace and so we wanted to make sure that we added something to the portfolio that was going to be -- give us a significant opportunity into the future.","Chris O'Cull","Okay. And then just, answer this question in a different way, but how quickly could you accelerate development of Cheddar's? Do they have managers in training, opening teams or do you plan to use the other brands to help, build those spots? Maybe talk a little bit about that.","Gene Lee","Chris, I think someone asked me earlier what have we learned in the past? We learned that integration is hard and so we're going to spend the first 12 months, 12 to 18 months integrating the existing units into our systems so that we can benefit from our advantages.","They\u2019ve got a strong pipeline, but like any business that we've owned, people will be the restrictor on how fast you can grow and so we'll figure out over time is there is a way for them to leverage resources, human resources from our other brands to help them grow, but if not, we will grow as fast as we have the human capital to grow.","Sites won't be a problem, but we'll just to gauge our readiness from a human resource standpoint. We've got to -- the biggest challenge I see growing this brand is to maintain the culture and don't dilute the culture into the future and to do that, you've got to train people and give enough time in the brand so that they can understand what you're trying to do. These are high-volume, fairly difficult restaurants to operate.","Chris O'Cull","Okay. Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Jake Bartlett from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Jake Bartlett","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first just a point of clarification just so we understand the growth at Cheddar's in the past, how many units did Cheddar's have at the end of 2015 and I asked looking at Technomic numbers, which show 168, so wanted to make sure that that's correct or not?","Rick Cardenas","Yes Jeff, Jake, I am sorry. This is Rick. We don't know what the Technomic number was. I hear you say 168. I don't have the number that they had at the end of '15 in front of me, but we get back to you on a one-on-one call with that information.","Jake Bartlett","Okay. And then also just in terms of your own unit growth you gave us 30 to 35 gross units in 2018, can you help us out with what that means for on a net basis? ","Gene Lee","Well, in a typical year, we may have some restaurants as leases are coming up, I would just keep -- we gave you the growth numbers, so you can understand the capital piece. We'll give you -- what I can tell you is in our long-term framework, we've got 2% to 3% total new unit growth, which includes closing. We think we'll be within that framework without Cheddar's.","Jake Bartlett","Okay. Maybe could you help us year-to-date this year in 2017 how many have opened and how many have closed?","Gene Lee","Yes, we have opened -- year-to-date, we've opened 15 and we've closed six. We have as I said 24 to 28 openings -- growth openings in the plan this year.","Jake Bartlett","Okay. Thank you very much.","Gene Lee","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. Just two number questions, the 17% in the Cheddar's margin, how much is marketing in that or how does that compare to what you pay or you spend on marketing for your brands? And then also I just, I don't know if you addressed this or not, I am sorry if I missed it regarding franchising.","Obviously, this was the first brand that you've gotten in your portfolio now with franchise growth potential. What type of commitments are out there and is this something that's going to be consolidated longer term or is this now a new addition to your portfolio of franchise growth?","Gene Lee","Hey Matt, marketing as a percent of sales is fairly low. It's less than 1% as a percent of sales. As it relates to the franchise growth, there aren't any commitments really from these franchisees to open any more restaurants and we will talk a little bit more about what our plans are as we get through the integration.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. No more questions at this time sir.","Kevin Kalicak","All right. Thank you, Ray. That concludes our call. I want to remind you that we plan to release fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, June 27, before the market opens with a conference call to follow.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have I any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.","Kevin Kalicak","Thank you, Tori. Good morning and welcome everyone. With me today is Gene Lee, Darden's CEO and Rick Cardenas, CFO.","As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release which was distributed earlier today and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.darden.com.","Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation and in the Investor Relations section of our Web site under non-GAAP reporting. We plan to release fiscal 2017 third quarter earnings on March 28th before the market opens followed by a conference call.","This morning Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights and Rick will then provide more detail on our financial results from the second quarter before we open the call for your questions.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we get ready to head into the holidays. We'll keep our remarks brief so we can get to your questions.","We had another good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.64 billion, an increase of 2.1%. Same restaurant sales grew 1.7%. Outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 450 basis points and diluted net earnings per share were $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share.","Our intense focus on food, service and atmosphere drove our performance once again this quarter. Additionally, at the Darden level, we continue to concentrate on our four competitive advantages. One, leveraging our significant scale to create cost advantages; two, using our extensive data and insights to better understand our guest and effectively communicate with them; three, ensuring our brand is systematically go-through our rigorous strategic planning process; and four, cultivating our results oriented people culture to enable growth.","Our approach continues to be effective and we believe we still have opportunity to improve in all aspects of our business. Olive Garden's strong momentum continued during the quarter. Same restaurant sales grew 2.6% outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 540 basis points. This was our ninth consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden.","Looking at the key drivers of this performance, it was really three things. First, the operations team led by Dan Kiernan continued to improve restaurant level execution. We're committed to improving the service experience and still have more opportunity on that front. However, we did achieve all-time high scores for both overall guest satisfaction as well as server attentiveness during the quarter.","Next, we continue to see solid growth in our OG To Go platform. To Go sales grew 21% compared to the same period last year and more than 50% on a three year basis. During the quarter, we added the create your own pasta station to our To Go catering menu enhancing the convenience of To Go by providing a customizeable off-premise dining experience.","The exciting thing about To Go is that our operations excellence team continues to learn more and more about how to meet our guests' growing needs for convenience. And finally, our promotional and core menu strategies continue to work together to create value for our guest. During the quarter, we had two strong value promotions. Buy one, take one, which capitalizes on the consumers need for convenience by allowing them to buy one entree and take a second entree home to prepare later and Never Ending Pasta Bowl. Both of these leverage brand equities and were supported by integrated marketing highlighted by our Olive Garden highly anticipated pasta pass.","In honor of the 21st anniversary of the Never Ending Pasta Bowl, we made 21,000 pasta passes available, and all of them were claimed online in less than one second. The passion demonstrated by our guest who got a pasta pass and disappointment by those who did not reinforced the strength and relevance of the Olive Garden brand.","LongHorn Steakhouse's same restaurant sales grew by 0.1%, the 15th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 290 basis points. Our focus at LongHorn remains on improving the guest experience. We are doing this primarily by making strategic investments in quality and simplifying operations to improve restaurant execution. And we're seeing positive results. Our research shows strong improvement in LongHorn's ability to provide value through high quality food and service and that's important because value is the number one driver of guest intent to return.","Additionally, LongHorn has refined their new restaurant opening process. We're very pleased with the results we've seen in the new restaurants opened over the past nine months and it gives us greater confidence about future openings. The team at LongHorn is engaged and focused on the right priorities. We are making long-term strategic choices to position the brand to compete effectively in the future.","I want to close by acknowledging that the holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they create memorable experiences for our guests. On behalf of our management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our team members for all you do to help our guests celebrate this time of year with family and friends and for making our company successful. We continue to get better every day and I'm excited about the new calendar year ahead.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss our results in more detail.","Rick Cardenas","Thank you, Gene, and happy holidays, everyone.","As Gene mentioned, we had another good quarter with diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. Included in this $0.64 is one penny of unfavorability from market based compensation due to the significant appreciation in the stock market that was not perfectly hedged. This market based comp impact is reflected in three parts of our P&L. Restaurant labor, G&A, and income taxes. So I will provide more detail in our margin analysis.","We continue to return cash to shareholders this quarter, paying out approximately $70 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 300,000 shares of stock, totaling around $19 million.","Turning to our margin analysis. We had sales leverage from our positive same restaurant sales of 1.7%. We also continued to realize cost savings throughout the P&L and are on track to meet our $30 million of net cost savings in fiscal 2017.","Now, in addition to these sales leverage and cost saves I just talked about, we also had favorable food and beverage expenses due to commodities deflation of approximately 1.3%, 20 basis points of unfavorability in restaurant labor of which 10 points was related to the market-based compensation expense. Unfavorable restaurant expenses of 130 basis points, all related to the incremental rent expense and other taxes resulting from real estate transactions last year.","G&A was unfavorable as we lapped the $13 million favorable legal settlement in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and we had roughly 20 basis points of unfavorability related to market-based compensation this quarter. Excluding these impacts, G&A would have been favorable 60 basis points to last year.","Depreciation and interest were favorable, as expected, related to the real estate transactions. The impairment line was favorable due to impairments last year of three restaurants totaling approximately $7.7 million. And finally, we still expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 26% and 27% for fiscal 2017. However, this quarter's rate was lower than the annual expectation due to tax favorability related to the market based compensation impact.","Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, due to the real estate transactions last year, segment profit includes incremental rent and other tax expense of $21 million for the quarter. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. Going forward, we do not expect incremental impacts in future quarters as it is now more than 12 months since the spin-off of Four Corners.","Olive Garden segment profit of 16.8% was 80 basis points lower than last year for the quarter, as additional rent drove 170 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding this incremental rent, Olive Garden's segment profit margin was 90 basis points higher than last year.","LongHorn Steakhouse segment profit of 14.4% was 60 basis points lower than last year for the quarter, with additional rent expense driving 120 basis points of unfavorability. Adjusting for the incremental rent, segment of profit margin increased 60 basis points at LongHorn.","Segment profit margin of 18.2% was flat to last year in our fine dining segment. While our other business segment profit grew margins 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Even with additional rent headwinds of 50 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding this incremental rent, segment profit at our other business would have been 110 basis points higher than last year.","Finally, as we reported this morning, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2017 outlook for earnings per diluted share of $3.87 to $3.97. And our same restaurant sales growth outlook of between 1% to 2%. Additionally, our total inflation estimate of between 1.5% to 2% remains the same. However, this inflation expectation now assumes commodity costs are flat to last year and that labor inflation is approximately 3.5%. I am proud of the work our teams continue to do to strengthen our performance and drive shareholder value. This continued progress gives us confidence in our expectations for the remainder of our fiscal year.","And with that, we'll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, speakers. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. First question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer Securities. Your line is now open.","Brian Bittner","Thank you. Good morning, guys. The industry trend actually got a little bit worse sequentially from your first quarter but trends at Olive Garden for you guys actually accelerated sequentially. I really have two questions on that. First question, is it the industry trend really being held down by the bottom half of the players within that trend? Is that kind of what you're seeing? And the second question is what really drove your widening gap versus Knapp this quarter versus just a quarter ago. Was a lot of the incrementality from that 20% growth in To Go or is there something else going on?","Gene Lee","Hey, Brian. We got a lot to unpack in that question there. And we had a little bit of trouble hearing you. Let me see if I can get to it. I think when you look at Knapp throughout the quarter there's a lot of noise in that number. We had some holiday shifts. You also had a major hurricane in that period which affected brands differently. So we look from October to November, there was just I think a point just in Halloween switching there. Veterans Day messed around a little bit with sales in November moving from midweek to the weekend. So I think that created a lot of noise in the quarter. I wouldn't get too hung up on the months to months there.","As far as the overall -- when you look at the overall indexes, I think you were asking about is it really the bottom 25% that's dragging that down. I think there's something to that. I mean, we obviously don't have visibility into everybody that's in that index and what the distribution looks like, but I keep coming back to what I believe are the really well-positioned concepts that are out there that are executing at a high level, they continue to grow market share. And so that's what pivots us back to -- we've just really got to be focused on what we can control and we work off that core operating philosophy of food, service and atmosphere. And if we're not focused on one of those three things, other than our competitive advantages at the Darden level, then we're not working on the right stuff. We're just focused on trying to make our guests happy and right now that's working for us.","Brian Bittner","Okay. So I'm sorry you couldn't hear me. The second question I had on that was, was the To Go growth the biggest driver you saw of the widening gap versus the industry or was there something else that you could point to?","Gene Lee","I think we happily saw some great momentum with takeout, but we also saw some good in-restaurant momentum. I think our two promotions in Olive Garden that we ran during the quarter, Never Ending Pasta Bowl and buy one, take one, are very, very strong value promotions and they're tough for our competitors to really go against. And we had a lot of great publicity around the pasta pass and a lot of people were excited about that promotion. So I think it's two-fold. I think we had a good quarter in takeout. The business continues to grow. But I think we had a good quarter in restaurant also with our strong value promotions.","Brian Bittner","Okay. Thanks, Gene.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","David Tarantino","Hi. Good morning. Gene, I was just wondering if you could share your thoughts on the overall industry outlook post the election and I know you may not want to comment on trends you're seeing quarter-to-date, but is there any signs of strengthening or optimism that you're seeing related to the outcome of the election?","Gene Lee","No, David, I'm not going to comment on what's happening in the third quarter. I would say as I think about this, the new administration's pro growth policies if they're implemented should be good for restaurant consumers. We're watching closely. But there's a lot of time between talk and action and how that's going to impact us long-term. I'd like to say we're somewhat hopeful that these pro growth policies will help. What's happening in Washington is not going to change what we're focused on. And we believe in our strategic -- the strategic choices we've made here at Darden and this should enable our brands to consistently outperform our competitors going forward.","David Tarantino","Great. That's helpful. And then, just one question about the current quarter. This is an unusually challenging comparison that you're cycling. Is that the way you're looking at it? Is this a tough comparison or I guess how would you frame up sort of the current quarter and the puts and takes on that?","Gene Lee","Yes, David. I think it's fair to say this is a difficult quarter. We had a little bit less than normal winter last year, so we had some favorable winter throughout the season. December was very mild and didn't have a lot of weather impact last year. So it's a -- we had a lot of momentum in the quarter last year. We also had a lot of calendar noise. We had the 52\/53. There were other things going on. I would say that right now I think holidays are slight negative in the quarter, but my counsel to everybody listening would be weather's going to be what weather's going to be and that really has no impact long-term on the momentum or the overall value of our company. And if it snows on a Saturday, it snows on a Saturday. But it's not going to snow next year on a Saturday. And so I'm not getting all worried about things that we can't control. And I'm trying to get the organization just to stay focused on creating great dining experiences. I believe if we do that and keep our 150,000 team members focused on that we'll continue to grow our business.","David Tarantino","Makes sense. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens. Your line is now open.","Will Slabaugh","Thanks, guys. Just wanted to ask on LongHorn, on the check there in particular, so that's been a little bit soft in terms of growth the past few quarters and in this quarter was slightly negative. Curious if you could talk a little bit more about the value that you're pushing in the restaurant and if we should think about that check remaining in the flattish to down range going forward, and then, what you think that eventually might mean for traffic.","Gene Lee","Yes. Good observation, Will. I mean we are doing some different things with our merchandising on the tables which is having a little bit of a negative impact on add-on sales. We believe that we may have too much activity, too much -- too many things on the table that is not really enhancing the overall dining experience. So we had some negative mix at different times during the quarter. We've got a little less price in there, 1.5 I believe price. We're just trying to -- part of our strategic -- the strategic choice in LongHorn is to try to simplify. We believe that business over the years has gotten too complicated. For it to work, it needs to be a high food cost, low labor cost model. And so simplification's a big part of it.","We believe that we'll continue to try to under price a little bit in LongHorn, as we are in Olive Garden, but I'm not overly concerned right now with a little bit of movement in negative mix as we try to get -- try to undo some of the things I think that weren't done for the right reasons for the brand in the past.","Will Slabaugh","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","John Glass","Thanks very much. Rick, two questions for you. First, just on post election, a lot of proposed changes around taxation. Can you frame up how you think about it first just from a corporate income tax benefit? You've got a lower rate because you benefit from some deductions. How do you think about how your rate might end up in a lower corporate tax rate environment? How do you frame that up? How do you think about things more broadly? Maybe there's CapEx depreciation accelerating. Does that benefit businesses like yours and would that incent you to build more restaurants because of that? Have you spent more time post election thinking about possible tax implications and how that may change how you think about capital allocation?","Gene Lee","We've thought about this for quite a bit. But, I will say, just in tax reform and other things, we've been working with members of Congress for many years on tax reform over time. We look forward to continue to work with the new Congress and the new administration on those things. We do have an advantage on some of those items but we'll continue to work with them to find out what the best solution is for everybody. We'll continue to apply the appropriate discipline on our capital spending and ensure that the capital provides a positive return above our cost of capital. So whatever that tax rate is, we'll take into account with our growth in the future.","John Glass","Okay. Thank you. And then just on G&A, appreciate it was lower year-on-year because last year's was high. But it's lower than it was in previous years, previous quarters. Is this the right run rate current quarter G&A or was there something unusually low about this quarter relative to, say, the last couple of quarters on G&A?","RickCardenas","I wouldn't say there's anything unusual. I would say we continue to find cost savings throughout our P&L. As we've mentioned we've got $30 million this year, $165 million or so over a three year period and a lot of that is in the G&A line. Just remember, this is our lowest volume quarter so G&A is usually a little higher there. But we were -- I think what I said about 60 basis points better in G&A had we not had the legal settlement last year that was favorable. I would just say continue to think about our G&A more along the lines of the run rates that we've had over prior year as we continue to get our cost saves.","John Glass","Okay. As a percentage of sales, is that how you're looking at it, or dollars?","RickCardenas","We look at it as a percent of sales but I would tell you that a Q1 G&A dollar number isn't that different from a Q2 G&A dollar number which isn't that different from Q3. So but I would say if you focus on G&A as a percent of sales year-over-year, you'll probably get close.","John Glass","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. I just had one bookkeeping question, then a follow-up question also. With respect to the growth and the openings, I guess the 24, 28 new store restaurants and even the CapEx budget of 310 to 350 does seem like it's heavily back end weighted. Was that in your initial guidance? Is there any concern that some of those stores could potentially fall into FY'18?","Gene Lee","Yes, Matt, we still expect to open the 24 to 28 restaurants that we said at the beginning of the year. Based on weather and other things and timing of openings, generally a lot of them happen towards the very end of the year but we still expect to open our 24 to 28.","Matthew DiFrisco","Okay. And then sort of a longer term question also, I mean you guys have done a great job obviously you always compare yourselves to Malcolm Knapp Group, but seems like you've led the pack there or you're finding other ways to drive business. You've improved the Customer Service and you've seen it in your scores. You've seen you're outcomping the Knapp peer group. Does that sort of change the longer term vision of maybe the growth rate of these brands?","Are you thinking that the 24 to 28, if we see this demand and the superior demand trends continue, would that manifest itself in greater square footage growth or do you think you're just also expanding the capacity of the existing 800 stores and we would see probably more capital used towards enhancing and modernizing those stores on an ongoing basis to drive greater comps and greater leverage?","Gene Lee","I'll talk about a couple of things in that question. One, I point you back to our long-term framework for new unit growth, 2% to 3% a year. We expect to be this year at the low end of that. But as we move forward and we start building our pipeline, we expect to move closer to the middle or the high end of that range.","We also continue to invest in our restaurants as we talked about with Olive Garden and remodels. We're adding capacity in some of these remodels. We'll continue to find ways to invest appropriate capital to grow our business, whether that's adding more restaurants than we have in our long-term framework or getting to the top end of that range or adding more remodels. The other thing is we still expect all of our restaurant brands to grow. So we believe in all of our brands, every brand in our portfolio has growth opportunities for them and so we'll continue to see openings in all of our brands.","Matthew DiFrisco","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brett Levy","Good morning. I guess I'll just follow-up on the capital side. Can you provide us a little bit more clarity and updates on your remodel and renovation pipeline, how many you've seen completed, what kind of returns you're seeing and you how should we be thinking about the remainder of this year and into next year and the number of projects. Thank you.","Gene Lee","Good morning, Brett. It's Gene. We've got 23 full ones to complete in fiscal 2017. We've got 25% of the 160 approximate bar refreshes complete and we will have those done by the end of 2017. The remodels to-date are getting about 3.5% traffic growth. So we're still very pleased with what we're doing there and as far as I know and Dave George is sitting right next to me here saying we're on track to get these done this year. So I have not been told otherwise, so let's assume they get done.","Brett Levy","Fantastic. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from David Palmer of RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning. Away from To Go, when you compare Olive Garden's performance versus the casual dining peer set, where are you seeing the relative strength? And you can slice it in different ways but I'm thinking about the day parts that people say are weak for casual dining like lunch. Or even on a demographic spaces people talk about Millennials not using chains like they used to and I heard Olive Garden might be doing relatively better there. But any data points would be helpful about how you think you're outperforming? Thanks.","Gene Lee","Yes, David, good question. A couple things. We're actually seeing strength at lunch. And we're seeing strength on the weekend. Actually, the only place where -- it's not weak, it's just not growing as fast is as the other segments is Monday through Thursday dinner time. So we believe we have a little bit of an opportunity there. But, I think we've done some pretty good things at lunch to increase our value perception. You look at our lunch menu today, there's really only four price points on the front of it; $6.99, $7.99, $8.99, and $9.99. Every time I go for lunch I'm just -- I can't believe the value that you can get there, you can get at Olive Garden for lunch I think it's fantastic. I'd also say we've got some geographic areas that are performing really well for us. California, the Pacific Northwest, Mountain, continue to perform above the system average. We got good presence out there. So I think that's where we're seeing Olive Garden outperformance.","David Palmer","Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Karen Holthouse","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Just one quick one on wage inflation where guidance came up a little bit versus last quarter's range. I'm just curious if that's something where a particular region is driving it or if it's more broad-based. And then, how do we think about sort of cadence through the year? Is that 3.5 pretty similar quarter-to-quarter, something that's ramping into year-end? Thanks.","Gene Lee","Yes, Karen, another really good question. Labor is under some pressure. I would say the labor environment is -- we're operating in a low unemployment situation and in that environment we're going to continue to see wage increases.","Now, this is different as you might allude in your question, this is different, different parts of the country, depending on the overall economic environment. We have parts in our operations in that geographic area unemployment's extremely low, well below the national average and we're seeing a lot of wage inflation. And we've adjusted our practices to ensure that our management teams at the store level have the tools and the flexibility they need to be able to pay their people appropriately, based on the environment in which they're operating. I would say that historically these types of environments we've operated in them before have turned out to be great for our business.","And so I'm optimistic that this wage inflation that we're seeing is going to turn into discretionary income and some of it's going to end up back in our restaurants.","Karen Holthouse","And then the cadence in the year?","Gene Lee","I think it's increasing a little bit as the year goes on. But its de minimis, but we are seeing more and more pressure. The environment continues to get better out there from an employment standpoint.","Karen Holthouse","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Chris O'Cull of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Chris O'Cull","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Gene, the past few years it looks like off premise sales growth has stepped up in the fiscal third quarter. Is there a seasonal push around catering sales?","Gene Lee","Yes, Chris. Obviously, the more penetrated we get around the holidays, the better off we're going to be. Even Thanksgiving and -- that's second quarter. Around certain times of the year, convenience becomes more important. Valentine's Day, believe it or not, is the largest, it's the biggest takeout day of the year for Olive Garden.","Chris O'Cull","Is there an opportunity to he see off premise growth accelerate this season as you kind of broaden the reach or the awareness of the program?","Gene Lee","Yes. I mean, I think -- I really don't want to get into a lot of details around that that part of the business for competitive reasons, but yes, we're focused on it. We see it as an opportunity and we hope that business continues to grow.","Chris O'Cull","Is that part of the confidence you have in lapping these difficult comparisons this third quarter?","Gene Lee","I think you could make that statement.","Chris O'Cull","Okay. Great. And then one last one, Rick. Why do you expect inflation, commodity inflation in the back half of the fiscal year?","Rick Cardenas","Yes, Chris, we -- as we've said in the past, we forecast our inflation based on the contracts that we have and then what we have open. And we still have some parts of our inflation open or some parts of our commodities open. We're only about 70% covered for the back half of the year, so we've still got 30% To Go and we assume whatever's not covered is the typical inflation. So the hope is that the inflation isn't as high as we have in our plans as we continue to find and continue to go out farther in coverage, but we just want to make sure that we are prudent in what we estimate.","Chris O'Cull","Is there any commodity in particular that's floating in the back half that you're concerned about?","Rick Cardenas","Nothing that we're concerned about, but we just have a lot of things that are floating. In our presentation we've got beef covered at about 55%. Produce is the one that's the least -- that's the most covered at 80. But there's nothing that we're super concerned about. We just like to be prudent in what we forecast for inflation.","Chris O'Cull","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you. Two questions as well. First, just Gene, as you think about the industry and obviously have a lot of brands in our portfolio so I think of you as a pretty good proxy for broader casual dining. But, most of your peers have talked about headwinds, confluence of factors kind of pressuring results and I think you acknowledged the industry may be softening a bit. So, I'm not sure whether you would say you are less vulnerable to some of these headwinds. I was wondering if maybe you could kind of prioritize for us these different headwinds in terms of how you think they're impacting the industry, whether it's food at home, food away from home, divergence that we hear more and more about or the shift from brick and mortar to online or political uncertainty, value bundle fatigue, and just seems to be a lot of things that some of your peers are talking about, was wondering as an industry veteran how you would prioritize those potential headwinds for the industry. Then I have one follow-up.","Gene Lee","All right, Jeff. Again, a lot there. When I look at the industry today, I think there's more competition for discretionary dollars than there has been in the past. Whether that is -- I think the biggest one that we really don't talk about that is -- that people -- that restaurant sales are competing with is data and other what I would call new necessities today, whether smartphones, whether your cable bill, your Netflix bill, those all have increased significantly over the years and I think that people are making choices. And I just think it's not just confined to food.","I think people just -- I think we're competing. And we've got to in the industry and most -- my focus at Darden is to find a way to create a reason for people many want to come spend money with us. And I think we have to continue to innovate from a culinary standpoint. We've got to do a better job from a service standpoint and we've got to create environments that people want to come to because they have more choices.","I think if you read a lot of Malcolm's -- he talks about the reallocation nation, I think there's a lot of truth to how he's describing the situation in the industry. People are feeling better and when they feel better they're spending on bigger home good items. So that's having an impact. But as I look out over the overall industry and I look at people that -- brands that continue to create value from the real value players, all the way up to mid, all the way up to higher end, if you're doing a good job and you've managed it over the years, I think conservatively, I think you're doing pretty well today.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got it. And then, just a comment you made earlier in terms of I think we can see the sequential trends in terms of menu pricing but it seems there's easing at both core brands in recent months. Just wondering if that's a conscious decision or maybe how should we think about that outlook going forward and your ability to protect the margin if pricing continues to slow down to that maybe 1% range. Thanks.","Rick Cardenas","Yes, Jeff. This is Rick. Our pricing for the year we still expect to be at the low end of the 1% to 2%. And as you did say that we've had some deceleration in pricing that's more because we took pricing multiple times last year versus the really one-time this year.","As you think about our advantages that Gene's talked about so often and scale being one of them and driving costs out of our business, we use that to reinvest and one of the ways that we reinvest is by pricing we hope below our competition in the long run. So whatever happens with inflation or other things, we still expect to focus on keeping pricing at the lower end to maintain and accelerate our value proposition and we are -- we continue to fight for that as long as we can.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from of Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Stephanie Ng","Good morning. This is actually Stephanie Ng representing Sara Senatore. A quick follow up question on labor. Could you comment on the DOL overtime ruling, does that impact you at all? And could you see labor pressures easing with the new administration and how much of an impact would changes in federal regulations really have since you've already addressed this first and some of your benefits in compliance?","Gene Lee","All right. Overtime regulation, whether that's implemented or not as we've said in the past it's not going to have any material impact on our business of the compensation levels of our managers. So there's really -- there's no story their for us. That's a non-impact.","As far as the new administration, I would say we would expect less structural pressure at the federal level, but we expect to have continued activity at the state level, which is really where the pressure has been for the last decade. And so, I don't know how much the changed administration is going to have on our overall labor policies going forward. I see this as much more of a state issue.","Stephanie Ng","Okay. And a quick follow up. You spoke earlier about the price point for lunch but could you provide a bit more color on menu or food based on that lunch? And also given weakness in the biggest fast casual competitor, are you taking any traffic share from that category?","Gene Lee","I'll answer that. We haven't been able to trace back where the share's coming from. But we've innovated at lunch and I talked about this in the past. I mean current management team, Dave George and Jose and Dan, for the first time have been able to unbundle soup, salad and bread sticks effectively at lunch with the duo platform which allowed us to get back to the $6.99 price point. And to me, that's been the big innovation, the big breakthrough. When you look at our, create your own lunch duo, which pivoted us away from having to rely totally on soup, salad and bread sticks. That to me has been the biggest innovation in Olive Garden ands has really just changed the whole complexion of lunch.","I mean for $6.99 you can get an eggplant parmesan sandwich and all the soup or salad that you want. That's an incredible value. I'm looking at the menu right now and it's just you get a meat ball sandwich for $6.99 plus either a soup or salad and that's all if you need option. Incredible value. We've got to continue to find ways to communicate that and we've got to continue to innovate the food platform inside that. But that's our big innovation.","Stephanie Ng","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Jeff Farmer","Great. Thank you. Just following up on some of the labor questions. You suggested that discretionary wage rate increases are having a greater impact on labor inflation than some of the legislative wage rate increases that are out there. So with that said, is that prudent to assume that this discretionary wage rate pressure driven by that very tight job market could persist or even intensify as you guys get deeper into calendar 2017 or as we move into calendar 2017 and get deep into calendar 2017?","Gene Lee","There's always the chance that it could get deeper and if unemployment continues to decline, but I would say that we are very well positioned to deal with that. Industry turnover continues to increase. Darden's team member turnover in the second quarter actually declined slightly. We've got a strong employment proposition that we will continue to work hard on. We believe we have a great relationship with our team members and that's one of our competitive advantages. And so if the labor market continues to tighten, I think we're very well positioned to handle it. We've been working for a year with our restaurant teams and changing the processes and procedures on how we hire, how quickly we do it.","We're becoming much more technologically advanced with that. We know that's going to be a real problem. It's something that we wake up every day and we think about is how are we going to make sure that our employment proposition remains strong and that we are going to be -- we are going to have enough team members to do what we need to do.","Jeff Farmer","That's helpful. Then an unrelated question. November consumer confidence index number jumped 107. I think that's the highest reading in almost 10 years. To the extent you guys have looked at this data, if you go back and look at the last 10 plus years of your own business, have you seen your same-store sales traffic trends, whatever that might be, is it a relationship worth discussing between your same-store sales and traffic trends versus those consumer confidence numbers or do you find that relationship to be relatively weak?","Gene Lee","That relationship is relatively weak.","Jeff Farmer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Jason West of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jason West","Yes. Thanks. Couple questions. One, I guess last quarter you guys talked out about one of the few areas of weakness was Texas, particularly on the higher end brands. I think you said Olive Garden was lagging a little bit there as well. Just wondering with the improvement this quarter if you saw any strength or stabilization in Texas and sort of the outlook there?","Gene Lee","Yes. It's slightly better but still lagging. In certain parts of Texas that are more difficult. I mean Houston obviously continued to struggle. Dallas is a little bit -- Dallas is fine. And so overall Texas is a little bit of a drag, but it's better than it had been. As we're starting to -- basically we're starting to lap when Texas became a problem.","Jason West","Okay. Got it. And in terms of the To Go business, providing such a nice uplift here, I mean can you guys I guess give us an update on where mix is. I believe it's around 10%, 11% of sales. And how much of the strength there is from new platforms around catering since that's a fairly new offering or is this really more about the in store To Go business just continuing to gain strength? Thanks.","Rick Cardenas","To Go was 12.6% of total sales in Q2 and it's all aspects. I'd go back to the insight that we're operating on. It's convenience. The consumer is demanding more and more convenience today and one of the things that we think about here every day is how do we apply that to everything that we do. That's the biggest thing I've seen change in I think about decades. Over the last decade, the consumer's desire for convenience has significantly increased and I think that's what's driving the takeout in Olive Garden because we're able to meet that need, that need state, through multiple channels. And again, I go back to we have food that travels extremely well.","Jason West","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Andy Barish","Hi, guys. Just a quick one back on LongHorn. Can you give us an update in terms of where you are in sort of shifting the promotional strategy? I think you were kind of moving away from the value consumer and trying to move a little bit higher price point and why that isn't showing up in the mix line as well.","Rick Cardenas","We've been pivoting away from the low price steak promotions. We have not been trying to pivot to higher price points. I'd say we've gone to medium type price points, so it's not like we're out there advertising porterhouses. We're out there kind of in the middle. We were doing a lot of $10.99, $11.99 steak promotions that we thought we had to pivot away from. I think we're into only one of those now a year.","And so I would say it's more of a strategy of kind of pivoting away from these promotional periods where you have -- you're selling $11.99 promotional steak and you had other digital incentives out there which you need to have out there to be competitive. We determined that there were a percentage of the guests that we were serving; we were not making money on. And we decided that we were going to try to move away from that.","And I would urge everybody that's out there listening and thinking about LongHorn is look what we've done to the overall business model over the last 18 months and what LongHorn's profitability has become. This brand obviously the one that I am the most familiar with, as I ran it for a lot of years, is a high quality, is a simple, high quality business and that's the way we're going to win. We're making the right strategic choices. I believe in it. These decisions that we're making are going to take years to pay out.","But as I look at the landscape and I look at the landscape of all of casual dining, I think there's a niche over time that LongHorn can compete in and be extremely effectively in. It's not going down. It's not going down and competing with the more value players. It's actually carving a niche out a little bit above what I would call traditional casual dining.","Our research is incredibly encouraging. You I am not hung up right now on what day-to-day same restaurant sales are. I believe in the research. I believe that we've got the business model back. The business is still too complicated and we've got to simplify it so we can continue to remove some labor from the operation so that we can invest in great steaks and get them cooked right for our guests.","Andy Barish","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Andrew Strelzik","Hey, good morning. You just touched on some of the strategies at LongHorn. But you mentioned the proportion of the consumer base that focuses on value and you also mentioned wanting to be a high food cost, low labor cost model. So I'm just wondering bigger picture, longer term, as you're thinking about reinforcing that value, it doesn't seem like service in that model really is going to play as large of a role maybe as it played at Olive Garden. Is that the right way to think about it? How do you really think about pulling those value levers without the price point promotions over time?","Rick Cardenas","I think about it a little bit different. I think service has got to play a higher -- a more important role in LongHorn. We want great service in Olive Garden, don't get me wrong. If we're going to have a $21, $22 check average at LongHorn, that service has got to be better than casual dining service. We should have the best servers in LongHorn because they should make more money because the check average is higher, we do a little bit more volume. We should have the best people out there on the floor. I think that when I think about LongHorn, we're still paying the price for opening 40 restaurants -- approximately 40 restaurants for a couple of years. And we are -- by slowing down and really focusing on some basics, we have -- we're making great, great improvements and I think one area where since Todd's been involved, he's been really focused on food quality and getting the food back to where he thinks it needs to be. We both agree that we may have not paid enough attention to service and LongHorn for years had a unique service style that the consumer talked about. And I think that we've lost a little bit of that. And I think we're going to get back to a little bit more balanced operational message where we're going to continue to focus on food. We want to elevate the service experience inside of LongHorn. We think there's big opportunity there.","Andrew Strelzik","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","John Ivankoe","Hi. Excuse me. Couple of quick ones if I may. Firstly had, thanks for the outlook on the commodities for the second half of fiscal 2017, but it does kind of beg the question of what any kind of initial indication may be for fiscal 2018 as you see where commodities are relative to spots or futures, what have you and what your overall outlook may be if there's an early look that we could get there.","Gene Lee","Hey, John. Thanks. We're not going to talk too much about 2018 yet as we finish up this year. We're only halfway through this year. I will say we're taking coverage in 2018 now. So as we still see the supply out there, we're taking coverage on some products now which we might not have done in the past.","John Ivankoe","Maybe if I can get you to answer this one. Any outlook just on steak which I recognize it's not as easy for us to see in terms of just the overall trend of steak because it's not feeder cattle or live cattle in terms of where your buy might be as the biggest category.","Gene Lee","John, this is Gene. For competitive reasons, I'm not going to comment on that. But I'll give you the one place that I look. I think you can go right to CME Board and look at live cattle futures and just look at a three year trend and you can get a pretty good idea. The ratios changed throughout the years, but it can give you directionally where the market is. And so I'd look at that. I don't want to comment for competitive reasons what we're going to do on beef.","John Ivankoe","Okay. Fair enough. Thought I'd ask. Secondly, there's been a lot of conversation about restaurant supply. There's been some slowing in chains, independents maybe maintaining the rates, possibly even increasing the rates. But, could you give us a view of just kind of effective real supply increases as you currently see them and what your outlook might be for calendar 2017, if that's possible.","Gene Lee","We look at the Crest data which has historically been directionally the best piece of research. We're seeing the supply up slightly. It's outgrown population. I think as long as there's capital out there, people are going to build restaurants. Whether they're good investments, who knows. Especially on the independent front. So as far as capacity, I think that I would expect capacity right now to outpace inflation as long as capital is cheap, especially driven by the independents. I would continue to look for the strong -- continue to get stronger and people who -- brands that aren't able to reinvest into their business could get weaker through this cycle.","John Ivankoe","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Peter Saleh of BTIG. Your line is now open.","Peter Saleh","Comment you made a little while ago talking about wage increases and how it could potentially translate into some incremental discretionary income which could come back and show up in the restaurant sales. Are you seeing any evidence of that in states like California that were ahead of the curve on raising wages versus the rest of the country?","Rick Cardenas","Peter, I'd hate to make that connection that their wages are the reason why that we're seeing better performance in California. I'm not sure I can prove that out statistically. But California for Olive Garden is one of our better performing markets. But, I'm not quite ready to make that link yet.","Peter Saleh","And then on the To Go business, how are you guys thinking about delivery on single orders? Is that something you guys will consider doing either later this year or into next year?","Rick Cardenas","We've got multiple tests going on with all the big players out there. Obviously, they want us. We want them. We've just got to figure out how we make this work for both parties from a financial standpoint. Stay tuned.","Peter Saleh","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Nicole Miller of Piper. Your line is now open.","Nicole Miller","Thanks. Good morning. Couple of questions. You talked about your organic unit growth outlook. How does the portfolio look from the positioning of adding another brand organically and\/or acquiring another brand for the portfolio?","Gene Lee","Good morning, Nicole. I'm going to go back to a standard answer here, one that -- we're in continuous conversations with our Board and with the rest of management evaluating all our alternatives to achieve our business results. We're not -- I would just say that we're not in the active business of developing our own concepts today, but we'll continue to have these conversations with our Board and we'll figure out what's the right decision to build long-term shareholder value.","Nicole Miller","Thank you. And just a final question. Thinking about the specialty restaurant group and specifically most of them tend to be higher check, but the highest check concepts within that group, how do you think they're positioned for holiday? What do you expect not out of your brands per se, but just broadly bookings and the spend in terms of food and alcohol if you could? Thanks.","Gene Lee","You're asking a forward-looking question. I really don't want to duck it, but I'm really not going to talk about what's happening in December, or what our bookings are like. We'll talk about that in March.","Nicole Miller","Thank you for your time.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is in Howard Penney of Hedgeye Management. Your line is now open.","Howard Penney","Thanks for the question. My question is also on delivery. There is a lot of talk [Technical Difficulty] if one of the possibilities to participate in this market --","Gene Lee","Howard, you're breaking you up. We can't hear you, Howard.","Howard Penney","Can you hear me now?","Gene Lee","That's a little better.","Howard Penney","Sorry about that. I was just wondering if you agree with the statement that delivery would be one of the most disruptive influences on the restaurant industry in a generation. And then, the second question from that line is, would you ever consider building out your own network of [Technical Difficulty]?","Gene Lee","I'm going to repeat the question back. I think you talked about delivery being the most disruptive innovation in the industry and us building out our own network.","Howard Penney","Yes. Thank you.","Gene Lee","I agree with you, delivery is disruptive and as we think about developing our own network, all I'd say is that those are conversations as we think about where is it going to be in 10 years, those are conversations that we'll continue to look at. Developing your own network is couple fronts. We could be developing our own network that could handle the one-off deliveries. We think what we're doing today around catering is kind of our own network. Then it's all the way to could you actually build a kitchen in a warehouse district and deliver in a major city out of that.","So I see that disruption in a very long perspective. I mean you've got a lot of choices along that continuum. And so all I'd say is that we're aware of what the choices are and we think a lot about the Amazon effect, as we call it around here. What would Amazon do? And so that's where we kind of get to -- is someone going to develop a kitchen in one place and just deliver food from that kitchen. So that would probably be the most disruptive. So I guess the answer to your question is, yes, we're thinking about it. We don't have any plans in future, but we're fully aware of this disruption and where it could go.","Howard Penney","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Jake Bartlett","Great. Thanks for taking the question. With the prospect of wage inflation continuing to be strong or potentially increasing and commodity inflation coming in the future, how much opportunity do you have to continue to find cost savings, whether it's in labor or other areas of the business beyond the $30 million you're looking for in 2017.","Gene Lee","Cost saves are going to be a big part of how we go forward. It goes right into the number one competitive advantage I think we have which is scale. And challenged the Presidents of the businesses and the functional leads to make sure that we are as efficient as we possibly can be from a support standpoint and then secondarily, in all our non-consumer facing areas, have we become -- have used our scale as much as possible to be able to drive down cost. And we've made great progress. I still believe there's work to be done there.","Jake Bartlett","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your final -- go ahead.","Jake Bartlett","I just had one more clarification, actually. On the G&A, you mentioned an answer to an earlier question about G&A as a percentage of sales being about right on the year-over-year basis I guess, but I'm looking at G&A down roughly $10 million in the second quarter from the first quarter. Is the absolute dollar level that we're seeing in the second quarter, is that the right run rate to think about or was there some reason why that might be lower than your kind of run rate going forward?","Rick Cardenas","Yeah, Jake. Let me clarify what I said before. G&A is probably closer in the third and fourth quarter to what Q1 would have been maybe slightly lower than that. The reason Q2 was a little lower is incentive comp. We don't usually have as big a charge for incentive comp in Q2 based on the way our earnings grow throughout the year. So just to clarify, thanks for that question, Q3 and Q4 is more like Q1.","Jake Bartlett","Okay. Thank you very much.","Rick Cardenas","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Final question is from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. Just sorry if I missed it. Did you guys mention how much share repurchase you may have done in the current quarter or towards the end of the quarter, just the weighting of that $19 million, just because it looks like you may have more activity in the second half of the year than you had in the first half of the year.","Rick Cardenas","More activity in the second half of the year?","Matthew DiFrisco","Planned. Planned for the fiscal.","Rick Cardenas","What we've said in our long-term framework in this year is, we're going to be between $100 million to $200 million. The Board did authorize some more share repurchase after the first quarter. We've only bought $19 million worth of shares since then. And we'll continue to be opportunistic as the market gives us opportunities to buy.","Matthew DiFrisco","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time speakers no other questions on the phone. I would like to hand the call back to you.","Gene Lee","Thank you, Tori. That concludes our call. I want to remind you that we expect to release results for the third quarter on Tuesday, March 28th before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thank you all for participating in today's call and we wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference.

First, we need increased promotional innovation and increased promotional intensity around affordability at our 3 big brands, and this was made particularly clear this quarter, which has long been the most value-sensitive time of the year. Second, our results this quarter reinforce to us what we need to do beyond promotions to regain momentum at our largest brand, Olive Garden, and ensure we build on rather than lose the underlying momentum we've established over the last 2 years at Red Lobster and LongHorn.","In a moment Drew, is going to discuss our thinking about those issues. But before he does that, I want to provide a little more context around a secondary issue which we believe contributed to a loss of momentum this quarter and which is also a factor in our outlook for the full fiscal year. During the second quarter, Darden as a company, and especially our 3 large brands, was the focus of significant media coverage and online conversation relating to our testing of different labor models in advance of the implementation of healthcare reform. And while businesses across the spectrum, especially in the restaurant and retail sectors, are considering their options in this area, Darden and, most importantly, our brands were subject to a unique and sustained focus.","And as the story spread, many misinterpreted our actions as a stand against healthcare reform, and they came to believe we've made a declaration that we were committed to a policy which would avoid paying for healthcare for our full-time employees by limiting their hours. The volume of coverage and conversation about this was significant. And although it's difficult to measure, we do think it had an adverse impact on our results.","To reassure our employees and correct misunderstandings among our guests, we recently made 3 public commitments to our employees. First, none of our current full-time hourly employees will have their status changed to part-time as a result of healthcare. Second, we will continue to have both full-time and part-time hourly employees in all of our restaurants, because that's what it takes to deliver the experience our guests expect from us. And then, third, the healthcare coverage that we offer to our full-time hourly employees will be the same as the coverage we offer to all salaried and executive full-time employees.","The longer-term impact of this negative coverage on guest and on employees is difficult to predict. But because healthcare reform will remain a topic of much conversation over the next several months, it does contribute to our caution about performance for the remainder of the year.","And so what does it all mean? First, we believe that while Red Lobster and LongHorn clearly have improvement and opportunities, generally and improvement opportunities with promotions in particular, as they address those opportunities, we think they do so with reasonably solid underlying momentum. And that underlying momentum reflects the meaningful progress each brand has made over the past several years, and it also shows in the strong same-restaurant sales results that Red Lobster and LongHorn have posted when we look at their performance for the second quarter on a cumulative 2-year basis.","Second, while Olive Garden's results were at least as negatively affected by the healthcare reform controversy, even when we take that effect into account, we know that Olive Garden is well short of where it needs to be. And we see that when we look at its longer-term sales trends coming into the second quarter, and we see it when we look at Olive Garden same-restaurant sales performance for the quarter on a cumulative 2-year basis. Again, Drew is going to discuss in a moment our thinking about regaining momentum at Olive Garden.","Our third takeaway is that being the focus of controversy around healthcare reform implication -- implementation caused us to exit the second quarter with a lower sales and earnings base and lower cash generation potential going forward than would've been the case if we were only dealing with our operating challenges. And based on both our operating trends and our need to be cautious in the face of controversy, it's highly likely that, as Brad's going to discuss in a moment, our capital budget for next year, our fiscal 2014, will come down.","And with that, let me turn it over to Brad to walk you through the financial details for the quarter.","C. Bradford Richmond","Thank you, Clarence, and good morning to everyone. Darden's total sales from continuing operations increased 7.0% in the second quarter to $1.96 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $78 million in sales from Yard House, which we acquired on August 29, 2012. On a blended same-restaurant sales basis, results for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn declined 2.7% in the second quarter. In contrast, we saw continued same-restaurant sales gains in our Specialty Restaurant Group and a 0.7% same-restaurant sales increase on a blended basis.","While the current quarter same-restaurant results were negative, we were lapping a strong success last year for both Red Lobster and LongHorn. Over the 2-year, same-restaurant sales were very solid, with Red Lobster up 4.1% and LongHorn up by 0.2%. We have an opportunity to rebuild momentum, as Clarence talked about, at Olive Garden to achieve the similar success that the brands' building efforts at Red Lobster and LongHorn have had. Where there's -- at Olive Garden, their sales were -- over the 2-year period are down 5.7%.","Now turning to food and beverage expense for the second quarter. They were approximately 30 basis points lower than last year on a percentage of sales basis. This favorability was driven by lower cost for seafood, partially offset by higher cost for beef. For the second quarter, restaurant labor expenses were flat to last year on a percentage of sales basis due to lower incentive pay, productivity gains and improved wage management that offset wage inflation.","Restaurant expenses in the quarter were approximately 60 basis points higher than last year on a percentage-of-sales basis due to sales deleveraging, roughly 35 basis points, and the impact of adding Yard House, which was also about 35 basis points. Yard House runs higher restaurant expenses as a percentage of sales than the other brands as all of Yard House restaurants are leased.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 80 basis points higher than last year as a percentage of sales, due primarily to the acquisition of Yard House. Absent these impacts, selling, general, and administrative expenses on a percentage-of-sales basis would have been flat to last year despite higher media cost due to inflation. Depreciation expense in the quarter was approximately 40 basis points higher on a percentage of sales basis compared to last year because of the increase in new units and the remodel programs at our larger brands.","Overall, operating profit margins for the second quarter, our seasonally low quarter, were down 145 basis points to 3.9%. Yard House accounted for 80 basis point of the decline because of acquisition-related cost and a slightly lower margin at the operating profit level. Yard House adverse impact on operating profit margins is expected to decline to approximately 20 basis points in the back half of this fiscal year.","Our tax rate this quarter is 21.8%, approximately 360 basis points lower than the prior year, driven by increases in available tax credits and our tax planning initiatives as well as lower taxable earnings. We estimate that our annual effective rate will be in the 23% to 24% range, which is about 130 to 230 basis points lower than last year's annual effective tax rate. This annual effective tax rate will vary from quarter-to-quarter.","Now turning to our financial outlook. For the full fiscal year, we expect combined same-restaurant sales for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse of approximately down 1% to flat, and we expect a net new restaurant increase of approximately 100 restaurants, which is approximately 5% unit growth on our current base. With these same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant opening expectations combined with the acquisition of the Yard House, we expect total sales growth in fiscal 2013 of between 7.5% and 8.5% and that diluted net earnings per share growth from continuing operations for the year will be between $3.29 and $3.49. The expectations regarding diluted earnings per share include acquisition-related cost and purchase accounting adjustments of $0.08 to $0.10.","Turning to our commodity basket. We have approximately 60% of our total food spend contracted to the end of the fiscal year. We have not fully covered our usage through the fiscal year because we believe that premiums for future contracts are simply too great given where we expect prices to be in the cash markets as we look forward. Food inflation in the second quarter was approximately 0.2%, with seafood deflation in the mid-single-digits and beef inflation in the low-double-digit range. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect that our commodity basket will be see -- will see inflation in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%.","Now category by category, through the balance of fiscal 2013, seafood costs are lower on a year-over-year basis with nearly 100% of our usage covered. Beef costs are higher on a year-over-year basis with 60% of our usage covered. Poultry costs are slightly higher on a year-over-year basis with 40% of our usage covered. Wheat costs are slightly higher on a year-over-year basis with 20% of our usage covered, and dairy costs are higher on a year-over-year basis with 25% of our usage covered. Our energy costs are expected to be slightly higher on a year-over-year basis as we have contracted 30% of our natural gas, electricity in the deregulated markets in which we operate through the balance of the fiscal year.","I'll close by touching briefly on cash flow. The key observation for this year is that even with our revised sales and earnings outlook for the year, we still expect to generate approximately $1 billion in cash from operations. This includes a change where working capital goes from a use last year to a source this year. Last year, as part of our work to optimize the supply chain, we took ownership of inventory further up the supply chain, and that resulted in a cash outflow. This year, approximately half of that outflow will reverse, and the balance will do so over the following 2 years, resulting in positive working capital this year and likely into next fiscal year, too.","This fiscal year, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $750 million, which means there's approximately $250 million of cash from operations to support our dividends, and of course, our capital budget has a meaningful flexibility as well. In fiscal 2013, for example, we have trimmed our new unit opening plan.  At the beginning of the year, if you remember, we forecasted 100 to 110 units excluding the new Yard House restaurants, and now we intend to open approximately 100 units, including 5 new Yard House restaurants. Looking ahead to fiscal 2014, our thinking at this point is that we are likely to reduce capital expenditures by as much as 10% on a year-over-year basis, and most of that is likely to come from reduction in new unit growth as we strengthen our balance sheet and ensure we maintain solid debt metrics that preserve our investment-grade credit profile. We have more to say about cash flow, capital expenditures and credit metrics at our Analyst Investor Meeting in February.","And now, I'll turn it over to Drew to comment on our brands.","Andrew H. Madsen","Thank you, Brad. As Clarence and Brad have already mentioned, we're clearly disappointed with our second quarter performance. So this morning, I'm going to spend more time discussing the broader industry and competitive dynamics we need to address to strengthen our same-restaurant sales trends going forward and less time on the second quarter brand-by-brand, promotion-by-promotion operational details.","So stepping back, our view is that industry sales growth will be modest once again next year, calendar 2013. And so what we will continue to see in casual dining is a highly competitive market share contest. This reality reflects important consumer changes over the last several years, changes that have resulted in a decline in category usage. The decline is most noticeable among more economically constrained households and, to a lesser degree, among Gen X and millennials.","And for all 3 groups, the primary issue is affordability. These consumers want to use casual dining more often than they do today but often do not feel that they can afford to do so. As a result, large chains have been increasing use of promotional price incentives, from nationally advertised promotions and couponing to increased levels of more targeted digital offers, and the promotional intensity has, if anything, been ramping up recently.","Now at the same time, what is also clear and important is that not all guests are motivated primarily by need for greater affordability. Over the past several years, we've also seen a growing desire among more economically secure guests for distinctive, higher-quality dishes that also have higher prices. In addition, many guests, millennials in particular, want more convenience in their total restaurant experience and menus that offer more freshness and greater flexibility to dine the way they want.","So the key issue for us has been how to respond tactically from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter in a way that addresses an urgent need for affordability among some guests while ensuring that, strategically, we're doing what is required to strengthen and evolve our brands in ways that appeal to all guests and strengthen and evolve our organization so that Darden remains in the industry leader for years to come.","As we weigh how we're doing in maintaining appropriate balance, our assessment is that we're making significant progress on important priorities that evolve our brands so they are better positioned for the future across all guest segments but we have not responded aggressively enough or effectively enough to address the needs so many guests have for affordability right now.","And here are few examples of what we've already done to put the planks in place to grow our guest base over time. All 3 of our large casual dining brands have recently introduced new advertising campaigns that help them create a more distinct brand identity and communicate compelling news about the guest experience that each offer. LongHorn and Red Lobster have each introduced meaningfully improved core menus, and Olive Garden has begun a phased implementation of compelling new platforms to their menu.  Now this is important because 80% to 90% of what our guests order are items off these core menus. These menus include a wider choice of affordable dishes, wider dishes as well as a wider choice of more distinctive dishes at slightly higher prices. While it will take time for this menu improvements to lead directly to increased guest counts, early results at all 3 brands are encouraging.","LongHorn has completed a remodel of their existing restaurant base, and Red Lobster will be approximately 75% complete with their remodel program by the end of this fiscal year. Both programs have significantly elevated brand perceptions among all guests and contributed to value-creating guest count growth. Olive Garden is preparing to implement their remodel program in the second half of this fiscal year.","We've also implemented organization structure changes in operations and marketing for all 3 large casual dining brands that are designed to do 2 things: first, to strengthen execution against our core fundamentals, especially as our restaurant base grows, which, again, is important for all guests; and second, to accelerate development of an array of innovative new programs that are each designed to appeal to different guest segments and help grow guest counts.","And finally, we're building an appropriately robust technology platform that can support targeted digital marketing campaigns and the digital engagement our guests increasingly expect and do so in a way that gives us competitive advantage.","When we look at the other side of the equation, providing the affordability many guests need right now, we have not been as consistently effective with our short-term tactics as we need to be. Fundamentally, we've been a little too protective of brand image, guest satisfaction and margin and as a result have not been sufficiently competitive to attract a more economically constrained guest looking for a great deal. We've also not responded quickly enough to communicate enough news across enough channels to consistently keep our brands top of mind.","Our second quarter is a good example. Because during the quarter, we took 3 calculated risks in our promotions that in hindsight did not appropriately take into account today's realities. First, we decided to raise the price of Olive Garden's Never Ending Pasta Bowl promotion $1 dollar this year to $9.95 in order to fund more price-pointed promotional weeks later in the year than we had last year. However, the traffic hit as a result of this price increase was much bigger than we planned.","Second, at Red Lobster, we began the year with a strategy to run 5 longer promotions this year instead of the 7 shorter promotions we ran last year in order to free up funds to invest in advertising behind the launch of Red Lobster's new core menu. The net result is that, beginning in the first quarter and continuing into the second quarter, guest traffic at Red Lobster during the added weeks has been lower than we planned, and this was most pronounced during October, when Endless Shrimp ran out of steam after 12 weeks on air.","And third, we decided to launch LongHorn's Stuffed Filet promotion without a price-point feature. This is a very distinctive dish with great guest satisfaction, and it certainly helps elevate LongHorn's steak expertise credentials. But it also carries a premium price, and in this environment, that likely contributed to guest count softness in October and November at LongHorn.","So given all these, we are making definitive changes to our second half plans to strengthen same-restaurant sales performance. Now we do not believe it benefits us to publicly disclose too much about our plans. In fact, we believe we need to be competitively less predictable, because we have seen some competitive preemption of our recent promotions. So I'm not going to discuss specifically the changes we're going to implement.  But I will say that Red Lobster, LongHorn and Olive Garden, have replanned the second half promotionally in ways that will more aggressively attack affordability, which means more promotions that are fundamentally about communicating a great deal and less about communicating brand-building news. It also means more price-pointed promotions with shorter duration than we previously planned. In addition, each of our 3 large brands is also significantly elevating the number of targeted digital offers that they will send their guests to help keep our brands consistently top of mind.","Now ultimately, our approach is intended to grow total operating profit by broadening the appeal of our brands and growing guest counts, even if profit per guest and margin as a percent of sales is slightly lower. Until we get further down the road, it's difficult to assess in a very precise way the trade-offs in the short term between better guest count traction and somewhat lower margin per guest, and that difficulty is reflected in our earnings outlook for the year. We're also zeroing in on ways to make sure we aggressively leverage our new operation structure to further elevate execution in our restaurants today and as a result build stronger guest loyalty for the future.","And with that, we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. John Glass of Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, I wanted to ask about the commentary around the reallocation of capital going into 2014. And I appreciate there's been a change in tone there, but 10% reduction in CapEx on a budget that's as big as you have and has been inflating doesn't seem like a lot. So, one, is that just your opening bid, or is there more on the table here? Because I think investors need to see a greater certainty around your cash flow, particularly as it relates to your dividend. And secondly, can you just give us an update on terms of your priorities? Buybacks didn't come into that calculation, Brad, when you talked about it, and yet now the stock is cheap, and you probably, all else equal, probably wish you had more dry powder to use that against the slower stock price. So can you talk about how you're reallocating some of those priorities and talk about if 10% is just the opening bid? Because it seems still fairly small relative to the size of the CapEx budget.","Clarence Otis","And -- I'll start and then hand it off to Brad. So this is Clarence. And it's still pretty early in the process as we think about capital expenditure budget for next year, so starting in June. As Brad said, it's got a lot of flexibility in that budget, and we are pretty focused on what we need to do there to make sure we have the kind of operating cash flows that we think we need to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. And so that's the first thing, is really to make sure we manage our debt metrics to preserve that profile. We think that's important. And so share repurchase, even if the stock price is lower on the list, then making sure we've got the right credit profile is how we think about it. But for sure, we've got flexibility in the capital budget.  As we look at the various streams, whether it's new restaurants or remodels, we'll put a finer point on it, but I think, as Brad said, we see at least a 10%.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes. And, John, the only thing I would add is I'd step back and say, even as we look forward with this year's performance, still generating operating cash flows of $1 billion, and so that's a significant cash flow that we have to work with. We've talked some about trimming, and Clarence elaborated some on the CapEx piece. We're going to continue to invest to protect that strong cash flow. So maintenance CapEx, remodels, those continue to move forward, but there will be some movement around new unit growth. And protecting our investment credit profile is something that's very important for us as we look forward.","Clarence Otis","And I would just say from a new-unit perspective, Olive Garden is probably the first place that we look. I mean, Olive Garden is over 800 restaurants. We've talked about what we think its ultimate potential is. It's not that far from that. Or even without the operating trends that we're seeing, we were poised to scale down. But that's certainly the first place, then we'll look across the entire capital budget.","C. Bradford Richmond","And we'll  share more in February. But -- and when you look at our new unit performance and their risk-adjusted cost of capital that they have to earn against, including any draw impact that they have in other restaurants, new restaurants continue to perform quite well with this. So they will remain a meaningful part of our CapEx budget.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I, though I -- I do think you'd probably agree that capital now being scarcer than it used to be, there probably has to be some hard decision made, even if those returns are strong. The second question just is relates to the promotional stance you're taking, more aggressive. Does that not just get you further into the problem you already have around sales volatility? I mean, how do you balance that versus saying, \"Listen, maybe we need permanent value on the menu.  Maybe that does take a onetime margin hit to reestablish kind of lower price points on the menu and build from there?\"  In other words, why does getting more promotional help you in the long run?","Clarence Otis","Yes. I think Drew got into it. So for sure, as we look at the core menu, we need to make sure that we've got a wide range of affordable price points, because that's important to a lot of guests.  And that is something that we'll -- that we've been doing, will continue to do. Red Lobster made a fairly significant move in that direction with its core menu rollout in October. From a promotional perspective, for sure, you have some volatility around promotions. And so if you're a little bit more promotional from a price perspective, there's a little more volatility. But over time, we really are looking for growth in promotional guests, and we're comfortable handling some of that volatility.","C. Bradford Richmond","And, John, Brad here. The volatility is, as you can predict it and know it's coming, which would -- we know our promotions, we know what we're running, we know the expected impact, that makes it easier to manage through from our perspective. So unexpected volatility does challenge our operators to execute at high level. But for the promotions we're planning, we have pretty good insight so we can prepare and be ready for that.","Andrew H. Madsen","And the only add I would make to the points already made is that it's really an and equation and it's making our promotions more affordable as well as building menus that offer more everyday affordability with more distinctive items. The improvements we're making to our core menus are going to take time to reflect themself in sustained guest count growth. And in the interim, to get better guest count traction now, we need to be a bit more aggressive in our promotions. But you can see it in the things our brands have already done. I mean, LongHorn's a good example. They've added 7 or 8 items under $15 in the last year, and in addition to that, they've just added a Porterhouse for Two that's an indulgent and premium-priced dish. And I think Clarence mentioned the Red Lobster menu, where we've meaningfully increased the number of items under $15. At the same time, their Crabfest promotion now is featuring a premium and distinctive crab and lobster bake dish as well. So it's really an and equation.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you talk about what I presume is the gap between the test market results and the actual results for recent promotions? Are you concerned that your market research and testing processes are broken? Perhaps they were to a different time. And where's your confidence that the test market results and the actual results can re-converge?","Andrew H. Madsen","Well, I think there's a lot of dynamics in the market today from what our results would predict several months ago when we originally tested them to what's going on in the market today, elevated levels of competitive activity, and some things are tough to quantify, like the negative PR that we got. But I can tell you, in the case of -- I'll use Olive Garden as an example, value is the biggest opportunity, particularly affordability, but we also need to put a fresh face on the brand. And their new campaign, Go Olive Garden, has got in our copy testing the highest scores we've seen for that brand in terms of what we'd ultimately call involvement and relevance telling -- talking about the brand in a new way that makes it more relevant for more guests. Dinner Today, Dinner Tomorrow as a promotion has the highest value ratings for any promotion that we've tested other than Never Ending Pasta Bowl. It's a little bit different of a construct, Dinner Today, Dinner Tomorrow, and we may not have done as good a job at describing that difference in our new advertising campaign. But we saw a markedly different performance in our dinner day part versus our lunch day part in the second quarter, with dinner getting progressively better with that promotion, ultimately about flat, and lunch remaining pretty soft, which means that's an area in our core menu platforms that we're going to need to address in the relatively near term.","Clarence Otis","And I would also say, Joe, so we've got a much more dynamic market then we had historically, and so consumer sort of confidence moves around a lot more. The competitive dynamic is such that people are in and out with things a lot more than they used to be. And so, for sure, as we test something, we have to discount those results more than we've had to do in the past, because the environment where we launched may have some pretty important differences from the environment where we tested.  And so we recognize that.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just a question on Olive Garden. As you try to improve Olive Garden's value standing, why are we seeing prices in check up year-over-year? And how is this the only concept with higher operating income year-over-year as you try to reposition? Don't you have to sacrifice margins going forward?","C. Bradford Richmond","Well, the biggest reason in the second quarter is that the check was up is our decision to increase Never Ending Pasta Bowl a $1. In addition to that, they introduced some new appetizers 6 months ago, a little more than that, and that's continuing to result in an increase in appetizer preference and add-ons. So those are really the 2 big drivers of it. And ultimately, as we've discussed in the past, we thought $9.95, even though it was up $1, was still a very compelling absolute price point, consistent with a strong value equation for the brand. But having said that, some of the things that we're looking at Olive Garden, as I described in my prepared comments, are going to more directly address affordability, which means there will be some slightly lower margin per guest. And as we regain guest count traction from that, ultimately, our goal is to grow total operating profit. But it's tough to predict it precisely in the short term.","Clarence Otis","And I would say, Joe, and Drew mentioned this, the reason why we thought it makes sense to raise it by a $1, the reason why we did it is because we wanted to fund more promotional weeks in the balance of the year. And so that was the thinking. And as you said, absolute dollar profit was up, but it wasn't up by nearly enough to support what we wanted to do. And so, in hindsight, it's something that we tried and that didn't work.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer and Company.","Michael Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","This is Mike Tamas for Brian Bittner.  Just looking at Olive Garden's comps, the third quarter faces a much more difficult comparison than it did the second quarter. So I'm just wondering how confident you are the changes you're making there to be able to successfully lap this. And is it something that we're going to see that quickly, or do you think it'll take a few more quarters?","Clarence Otis","Yes. I would say couple of things. One is weather is part of the third quarter comp at Olive Garden. So we had much milder-than-normal winter weather last year, and that's reflected in the comp for Olive Garden and all the others. And I forget, I think it was worth, we thought, about 2 points. Now that 2 points was because that quarter was comparing against a quarter the prior year where weather was much more severe than normal, and so it was a big swing. And so a swing back from mild to something that looks more like normal shouldn't be worth a point, or 2 points rather, but it's impossible to predict the weather. So that's part of it. I think on the other side, our goal is to have more consistent same-restaurant sales improvement at Olive Garden than we've had. And so as we look back, we had a third quarter, even without the weather, that was a pretty solid third quarter. We had weak fourth quarter. We had a decent first quarter this year and the weakness that we've seen in the second quarter. So the goal right now is just to get more consistent quarter-to-quarter improvement as opposed to setting aggressive growth goals.","Michael Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And if I could just ask one follow-up. Specifically, on Olive Garden, you talked about pulling back on the unit growth a little bit. And I'm just wondering how do you think that impacts your ability to kind of drive comp sales. And I was looking at some other concepts, it seems like Olive Garden over the last few years had been growing units faster that some of the competition. So how -- what does that dynamic look like going forward?","Clarence Otis","Yes. We've talked about what new restaurant growth pace at Olive Garden has been on the past few years does to same restaurants, and so it's been roughly a 70 basis points negative impact on same-restaurant sales growth, the pace that we've been on. As Brad said, we take that cannibalization into account as we look at our new restaurants and forecast cash flows, and it's got to cover that in order to achieve its hurdle rate when it comes to return on invested capital. But a slowdown means that, that erosion caused by the current pace will narrow some. That's what I think it means, so...","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Jason West of Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just another one back on the cash flow. Brad, can you just talk about your confidence level in that $1 billion of operating cash? Because you've got a long ways to go to get there for the balance of the year. And maybe if you could quantify how much of that's coming from the working capital. And I'm assuming you just assumed sort of normalized net income and D&A in line with the guidance, but I don't know if there's any other moving parts we need to be aware of there.","C. Bradford Richmond","Basically, that reflects earnings guidance that we have. It's right at $1 billion. What I would say is that a 1% movement in same-restaurant sales on an annual basis is about $30 million to $35 million of cash flow to help put that in terms of a sensitivity point of view. Like -- so we have a lot of things that go into the cash flow, obviously, driven by our earnings, but we've talked about working capital. And I think last year, that was a pretty significant usage. This year, we've talked about that is reversing out, as we had expected to. And so that when you even look at the first half of our fiscal year, our operating cash flows were up almost $200 million in spite of some of the top line weakness that we have. So as we look to the back half of the year versus the first half, to your point, long ways to get there, is the seasonal nature. This second quarter is very seasonally low quarter for us, so any variances or variability in the second quarter has a outsized percentage impact when you look at things. But if you look at last year's performance, particularly in the second half, the guidance that we have for this year, that puts you on track to have about $1 billion in operating cash flow. The biggest unusual mover would be this working capital change that last year was a usage, this year is a provider of cash flow to us. That's -- other than that, there's not any big secrets or big movements in the cash flows.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one other on the guidance for the back half. Can you talk a bit about the margin assumptions in there around things like COGS? And any other color you can offer us? Sometimes you do give some color on the current quarter for the line items.","C. Bradford Richmond","Well, obviously, with where we are year-to-date, margins are going to be down a little bit. I would say we're looking at a range, at the EBIT level, of about 70 to maybe 110 basis points for the year of a decline. I wouldn't want to go into particular line items, because we try to manage to the total. But we have had strong success on managing our restaurant labor, and there's obviously a lot of leverage in our restaurant expenses. So if we have more aggressive price points, that could raise our food and beverage cost as a percentage of sales. But to the degree it's driving some incremental traffic, we would leverage those on, I said, restaurant labor and restaurant expenses. So that, as Drew said, it's not so much about managing the percent as growing the absolute total operating profit that we generate from these activities.","Operator","The next question comes from David Palmer of UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Other than the sales malaise, with regard to the consumer backlash, with regard to Darden's tested or presumed response to Obamacare, I mean, clearly, you were taking steps that made you -- made it look like you're getting into damage-control mode. So it looks like you believed it. But what were you seeing that made you believe it, other than the sales?","Clarence Otis","Yes. Well, I would say we've got a lot of channels for listening to our guests. And so those include social media we track pretty heavily, we look at conventional media, all of those things. We've got a guest relations operation here, so we get guest feedback directly. And we saw significant spikes in all of those areas, and we see spikes on other issues. This dwarfed those. And it dwarfed them, even though on a lot of those other issues, it's -- the buzz is orchestrated. And so it's a lot of form letters and form calls. This was not orchestrated. This was organic, and so we think the intensity level was much higher. And then, as you said, we -- it's -- when you look at sales, there are a lot of moving parts, we're changing promotions, we're changing meal plans. So it's difficult to discern there. Probably the cleanest read would've been at Red Lobster, because they were relatively early in a promotion that in September was really quite strong and then dropped off immediately around the beginning of the conversation about this issue.","C. Bradford Richmond","And I'd add on that another dimension that what made us think that this had a negative impact on our business is the way we listen to what our employees were saying as well, and there was a particular spike in comments from employees across the country in our restaurants as well as here. And that reflects, obviously, what they're hearing, what their guests are saying and the way they feel, and we think it ultimately makes a difference.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then one -- the second and last question. Olive Garden profit was up slightly, and that makes the deleverage of the remaining brands that much more striking. I would guess that you're not shooting for that sort of profit sensitivity per same-store sales point of decline. What comment could you have about that, please?","Clarence Otis","Yes. Back to Brad's point about the quarter. So this is a seasonally low quarter. And so -- and it's -- the fall is a relatively value-sensitive time across all of retail, but certainly, across restaurants, and that really is what drives a lot of the seasonality. And so you get a lot more movement on these lines from these changes in top line than you would in other quarters.","Operator","The next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","There's been some earlier questions about the promotional and testing behind the promotions. I wanted to ask, actually, about the new menu rollout you were discussing today in your prepared remarks. How did you test those, for example, in what markets? Can you distinct if you're getting a new guest or a legacy guest more frequently? And also, what was impact to mix and margins and average ticket?","C. Bradford Richmond","Well, the biggest change was the menu -- new menu introduced by Red Lobster, and we tested that for not quite a year in multiple markets across the country. And we -- probably 80. And what we saw when we tested it over several months was a pretty modest reduction in check related to entrees that people were purchasing. A little bit of an increase in check related to new appetizers and different types of items on the menu than what we had today and about a point increase in traffic. And -- but that took several months to materialize. Since we've introduced it, and it's only been about 6 weeks, not even a couple of months yet, we've seen -- and the objectives for this menu at Red Lobster are to help sustainably grow guest counts by addressing everyday affordability, first, and, second, the veto vote, had more non-seafood variety. And since we've introduced it, we've seen almost a 50% increase in preference on items under $15 and more than doubling preference on non-seafood items.  So very early, but encouraging. That's the sort of guest behavior that we want to see to gain confidence that, ultimately, what we're doing is going to help grow guest count sustainably.","Clarence Otis","I think as Drew said, so the build for core menu change takes time. I mean, so that's not the same as a promotion. So that will occur over a period of time. We tried to stimulate some of that with the launch of that new menu having some media support behind it, but it does take time.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then just one question about the Specialty Restaurant Group, which you haven't talked about so much today. Could you talk about current holiday trends? Anything you'd be willing to share, specifically perhaps on The Capital Grille, or maybe you're benefiting from banquet and private dining bookings and how that is shaping up?","Eugene I. Lee","Nicole, it's Gene. I would just say that all the drivers for luxury are in place. Business travel is still improving. Holiday parties have been strong. And I would -- not getting ahead of ourselves here, I think the holiday season has probably been pretty strong for luxury brands.","Operator","The next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could talk just a minute on some commentary you made earlier and what you meant by being too protective of both guest satisfaction and brand image, which sounds maybe a little counterintuitive on the surface as you think about messaging and experience going forward and maybe how you balance that with the affordability push that you're making now.","Andrew H. Madsen","Sure. Well, obviously, we want to build brands that have broad appeal and build loyalty for years and years to come, and we start with the guest in everything we do. And part of the way we're trying to build distinctiveness is reflected in our promotions. So an example at both LongHorn and at Red Lobster, so Stuffed Filets is an example of how we're trying to offer distinctive dishes that you can't get anywhere else that really contribute in a meaningful way to building steakhouse quality and steakhouse credentials at LongHorn while also helping drive near-term guest count growth. That's worked for us in the couple of years. It didn't work as well this year, and we think one of the biggest reasons is probably the perception of that is it is distinctive but it's expensive. Crabfest is another example at Red Lobster. So part of what we want to do is become -- maintain the reputation of the brand as being the best choice for seafood and casual dining. And part of the way we do that is by offering, again, distinctive dishes that you can't get anywhere else, an array of crab dishes, in this example, that some are affordably priced, some are little -- a little more indulgent to build our image about food quality, food distinctiveness in the seafood space. That's a promotion that we ran middle of July and August last year. It contributed 5% or more same-restaurant sales growth when the industry was plus 1%. In the current environment, we think it was viewed as perhaps just a little bit too indulgent, perhaps a little bit too expensive, even though we featured a $12.99 dish that was better than the $14.99 dish we featured last year, so a focus on brand-building there. And on guest satisfaction, we're not going to do anything in terms of quality of ingredients, as an example, or service to jeopardize guest satisfaction. But we do believe what guests are willing to -- what some guests are willing to accept today in terms of portion size and price is a little bit different than what they might have been willing to accept in the past. And as we become more aggressive in affordability, we think there's room to refine what we offer without in any way negatively impacting guest satisfaction.","Clarence Otis","My only add would be -- so when we talk about building the brand, much of that takes place with the guest experience in the restaurant. And so it's about every piece of that, the core menu, the service, the decor and image inside the restaurant, the look and feel of the place.  And we try to support that with our advertising. And so the look and feel of the advertising consistent with the brand, promise that we're making and the brand delivery that we're endeavoring to do. And then we try to support that with a narrative inside the advertising as well. And so I think a little bit of what we're seeing is we're probably trying to make it work too hard, and the narrative needs to be more specifically about what a great deal it is. Now it still needs to be presented with creative that has a look and feel that helps build the brand. But we do think we do a lot of things in the restaurants themselves to build brand, and we can dial back, at least, on the narrative part, the brand-building piece and dial up clarity around a great deal.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then a quick follow-up from me on healthcare. I appreciate the takeaways there from the test on employee morale, guest satisfaction, et cetera. But wondered if you could talk about what steps you think you will be able to take to help mitigate these costs. And I know it's early here, with a lot of the regs not having been written, but any sort of estimate around what that cost might look like?","Clarence Otis","Yes. I would say it is very early with the regs not being written, and there's also -- as we think about costs when regs are written, we've got to make a very significant number of assumptions about employee behavior and how they're going to respond to the landscape. And some of those assumptions we'll have to make without full information, because we don't know our employees' household incomes. That's going to be a big deal in the new landscape. And so it's pretty too early to talk about cost. But our sense is that it'll be of a magnitude where we'll do things across a number of different sectors to mitigate costs. And as -- we've got supply chain. We've got a lot of levers, and we'll be looking at all of those.","Operator","The next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just, first, a clarification on the capital discussion around cutting back CapEx and leveraging that. One thing that you didn't address directly is the dividend. And could you maybe talk about how you're thinking about dividend policy currently, and whether there's a risk that the dividend might need to come down to maintain your investment-grade rating?","Clarence Otis","Yes. And I would say the answer is no. There's not a lot of risk that dividend will come down. Because as Brad said, we've got $1 billion, roughly, operating cash flow, a $250 million dividend and actual day-to-day renewal capital of $120 million. And so the flexibility in the capital budget is $600-plus million. And so the real question for us is less about dividend coming down and what about -- more about what dividend growth looks like going forward.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then maybe back to the question about affordability. And I'm just wondering how you arrived at your conclusion that you need to address affordability more so than focusing on the quality and differentiation of the experience. And more specifically, I guess, how do you think about the risk of training consumers that the brands are all about the price points you're offering rather than the differentiated experience that you're offering?","Andrew H. Madsen","Well, we think -- again, to reiterate a couple of points I made in my prepared remarks, we think we need to do both. There are guests where we need to strengthen affordability more directly, and there are other guests where we need to continue to focus on distinctiveness and quality. And then make sure for all of those guests, as Clarence just said, once they come into the restaurant, inside the 4 walls of our restaurant, that we're building value and loyalty by delivering a consistently great experience. But what's given us the belief that we need to emphasize affordability now, in particular, is that we have seen a drop in category usage among households that are more economically constrained, particularly under $60,000. That's more pronounced than any other demographic or generational cohort segment. Our drop in that group has been more pronounced than the industry drop, and that's -- we're still well above the industry in households under $60,000. But we've declined more than the industry, and that's a key part of the breadth of appeal of our brands and why we think we need to be particularly more aggressive there in our promotions while we continue to do other things with core menu and service that build quality and distinctiveness and value.","Clarence Otis","Yes. So again, it really is an and equation. We've got to do both, because both of these customer groups are big for us, those who are economically constrained and those who are economically secure. So we've got to do both, and we've talked about the strategies to really accomplish that.","Operator","The last question will come from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You touched on this earlier, but I'm just trying to get a better read on what a casual dining consumer, what the consumer's responding to in the current promotional environment. So I guess using Olive Garden as an example, you had the 2 for $25 promotion.  Did that attract a different type of customer than what you saw with the Dinner Tonight, Dinner Tomorrow promotion? And again, just trying to all relate that back to the deal narrative that you related to.","Andrew H. Madsen","I don't think we yet have great insight in that shorter time period on the difference or similarity of the guests that we're attracting with those promotions. But clearly, they're designed to be more about a great deal, specifically addressing affordability. We had very solid traction with the 2 for $25 that you mentioned earlier in the first quarter, and at dinner, we had solid traction with Dinner Today, Dinner Tomorrow. And that's what they were designed to do. But it's too early, too short, in just a couple of months, to have a -- draw a conclusion about the guest base.","Clarence Otis","And I would say -- so Dinner Today, Dinner Tomorrow is a more challenging construct, right, because the 2 for $25 is one that customers are familiar with, because it's being offered in various forms with different price points across the entire category. The other took a lot more to explain, and so those are differences.","Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I didn't know with one if -- for example, the 2 for $25, you're getting sort of increased frequency from a loyal customer, and with Dinner Tonight, Dinner Tomorrow, you're essentially renting some shorter-term customers. Is that even close to being fair?","Clarence Otis","No. That's not close to being fair, because we have a lot of customers. And so the question -- and they have different frequency levels. And so we need to dig in and understand better, as Drew said, over a longer period of time, which of those bases we were tapping into. But we have very few customers that are rented, very few customers -- and those are customers that we capture in our Specialty Restaurant Group. So some of those customers don't interact with our other brands, but beyond them, not a whole lot out there.","Matthew Stroud","We'd like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And we recognize there's still several of you in queue that have some questions. Of course, we're here all day today to help answer those questions.","We wish everybody a safe and a happy holiday season. We look forward to speaking with you again in February at our Analyst Day.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. You may begin.","Kevin Kalicak","Good morning everyone and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO, and Rick Cardenas, CFO.","As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company\u2019s press release which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings on June 21st before the market opens, followed by a conference call.","This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights and Rick will provide an update on our financial results and outlook for the year. During today\u2019s call and for the remainder of this fiscal year, all references to Darden\u2019s same-restaurant sales will only include Darden\u2019s legacy brands since Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen restaurants are new to Darden.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. As you see from our press release this morning, we had another good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $2.13 billion, an increase of 13.3%. Same-restaurant sales grew 2%, despite the negative weather impact, which Rick will address in his remarks. And adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.71, an increase of 29.5% from last year.","I am proud the ways our teams have executed against our strategy we rolled out three years ago, our operating teams remain focused on foods, service and atmosphere and at the Darden level, we continue to concentrate on our four competitive advantages. Leveraging our significant scale to create cost advantages, using extensive data and insights to improve operating fundamentals and to better understand our guests and communicate with them more effectively, ensuring our brands systematically go through our rigorous strategic planning process, and cultivating our results-oriented people culture to enable growth.","Olive Garden had another solid quarter. In fact, December was the highest total sales month in the history of the brand. Overall, same-restaurant sales grew 2.2%, the 14th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 310 basis points. Same-restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 440 basis points.","During the quarter, Dan Kiernan was appointed President of Olive Garden. I am excited to have an outstanding operator like Dan leading the team. His passion for our team members and guests coupled with his deep understanding of the brand makes him the perfect leader for Olive Garden.","Olive Garden continues to consistently deliver strong results, which I attribute to the brand\u2019s strategic focus on driving frequency among our most royal guests. This begins with flawless execution of the guest experience, and we will continue to focus on simplification to improve execution of our standards.","We were also able to drive more frequency by introducing craveable menu items that create excitement among our core guests. We introduced the new appetizer loaded pasta chips, and a new lunch entr\u00e9e, the Meatball Pizza Bowl, during the quarter and both were supported with successful integrated marketing campaigns that drove overwhelming PR buzz.","Additionally, our focus on off-premise sales is doing more than just meeting our guest needs for convenience. It\u2019s also enabling us to capture dining experiences that guests would not have previously considered for us. During the quarter, off-premise sales grew 13% and were approximately 15% of total sales for the quarter. Building loyalty also means that we need to continue to deliver meaningful value to our guests, every day.","During the quarter, we launched our new advertising campaign to build awareness for everyday value, highlighting our Lunch Duo starting at $6.99, Early Dinner Duos starting at $8.99 and [indiscernible] pasta starting at $9.99. The work we are doing is resonating, as industry data shows that Olive Garden has seen the largest improvement in our value ratings versus key competitors over the last year.","Our focus on everyday value and simplification has also allowed us to reduce the number of promotional offers we\u2019ll run this year. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we will not offer our one of our most popular promotions, Buy One Take One that we ran during the fourth quarter last year. Buy One Take One is a strong promotional platform for us. And to assure its long-term effectiveness, we don\u2019t not want to risk over exposure. However, not running this promotion may have a short-term impact on our traffic in Q4. I am encouraged by Olive Garden\u2019s momentum and we\u2019ll remain focused on making decisions that ensure our guests win.","LongHorn Steakhouse\u2019s same-restaurant sales grew 2%, the 20th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden by 290 basis points. Same-restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 420 basis points. The team at LongHorn continues to make solid progress against their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging LongHorn\u2019s unique culture to increase team member engagement.","We think about investing in the guest experience across all three guest touch points, food, service and atmosphere. While we\u2019re making investments across all three areas, our primary focus has been on increasing the quality of our food. In fact, we\u2019ve increased the size or improved the cut of nearly every one of our steaks over the last two years. Our focus on simplification by producing a number of new items needed to support our promotional offers is driving more consistency leading to higher levels of execution inside our restaurants. That\u2019s evidenced by the fact that LongHorn ranked the top of its competitive set on food quality scores. And while LongHorn\u2019s team member management retention levels lead the industry, we remain focused on team member engagement.","During the quarter, we kicked off our third annual Steak Master\u2019s competition. This program provides intense trading for our culinary team members, while creating excitement and increasing engagement with our entire team and each restaurant. And finally, our new LongHorn openings continue to exceed our expectations, and we\u2019re building a strong pipeline for future growth.","Now, I\u2019ll update you on Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen and our progress with the integration. Same-restaurant sales decline 2.2%, and that decline was driven by the 52 restaurants in the two franchise systems that have been acquired over the last 14 months. Same-restaurant sales at the 91 legacy Cheddar\u2019s restaurants were essentially flat. Operations leadership is focused on strengthening the restaurant management teams and working to improve operational excellence with the concentration on the previously franchised locations. Cheddar\u2019s is a strong brand that serves more than 6,000 guests per week. These high guest counts create some unique operational challenges that we will address, primarily through simplification. This will take time as we manage to the amount of change taking place across the system.","Turning to the integration. It\u2019s been less than a year since we acquired Cheddar\u2019s, and I\u2019m pleased with everything the integration team has accomplished in that amount of time. We are now in the final stages of our systems integration. All restaurants are utilizing our full distribution network. And we successfully transitioned Cheddar\u2019s on to the Darden payroll platform in December. The last major milestone is the rollout of proprietary POS system, which we expect to complete by the end of the fiscal year.","Our restaurant managers and teams are still familiarizing themselves with our systems and processes, and it will take time before they\u2019re fully comfortable using them. But, we\u2019re pleased with the insights and feedback we\u2019re receiving from the restaurants that are fully integrated into the Darden infrastructure.","As I\u2019ve said previously, this is a complicated process. We know, we\u2019re throwing a lot at the restaurant teams and we know it\u2019s distractive. But we\u2019re confident the long-term benefit will be worth the short-term impact is this having on the business.","Now, let me provide a quick update on the restaurant we just open in Washington D.C., called The Capital Burger. This retardant is a brand extension of The Capital Grille in D.C., which is a very busy restaurant with limited capacity. The Capital Burger is a way for more of our guests to enjoy bar-centric Capital Grille with a limited menu featuring our signature burgers. The Capital Burger leverages The Capital Grille\u2019s steak and wine expertise as well as their exceptional service to create an extraordinary burger experience. I am excited to see how our guests in that market will respond.","Finally, I want to congratulate all the restaurant management teams at Olive Garden and the Capital Grille for winning the People Report\u2019s 2018 Best Practices award. Being recognized as having the best workplace culture in the casual dining and fine dining, is a tremendous honor. We know it truly sets apart as our people and I am proud of the work each one of our eight brands does can ensure our results-oriented culture remains a competitive advantage for Darden.","Now, I will turn it over to Rick.","Rick Cardenas","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone.","We had another strong quarter with total sales growth of 13.3%, driven by 11.3% growth from the addition of 154 Cheddar\u2019s and 34 other net new restaurants, and same-restaurant sales growth of 2%.","Adverse winter weather negatively impacted same-restaurant sales this quarter by 70 basis points. The negative impact was experienced in January and February. Weather for the quarter was in line with the average over the last five years. However, we were wrapping on unseasonably mild winter weather in the third quarter last year.","Second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were a $1.71, an increase of 29.5% from last year\u2019s earnings per share. We paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased $19 million in shares, returning approximately $97 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter and over $440 million fiscal year-to-date.","Additionally, during the quarter, we further strengthened our financial position by issuing $300 million of new 30-year debt at 4.55%, replacing $311 million of our outstanding notes tendered that had a higher interest coupon rate of 6.8% and 6.0%. We funded the approximately $100 million of premium and fees, associated with the tender, with cash on hand and commercial paper.","Looking at the margin analysis, I am going to focus on food and beverage, restaurant labor, G&A and tax, as variances for all other lines on the P&L were relatively small on a year-over-year basis. Food and beverage expense was 50 basis points favorable to last year as pricing leverage, cost savings, and synergies more than offset commodities inflation of below 1%.","Restaurant labor was 130 basis points unfavorable last year due to several factors. First, we continue to see elevated wage inflation of approximately 4% that was only partially offset by the favorability we picked from pricing leverage and productivity improvement. Second, we are still experiencing negative brand mix from Cheddar\u2019s. Next, there were headwinds related to mark-to-market expenses for General Manager and Managing Partner equity awards, which I\u2019ll explain in further detail in a moment. Last, in January, we announced the $20 million investment in our workforce this fiscal year and we incurred approximately $9 million of that amount this quarter, most of which impacted the restaurant labor line.","General and administrative expense was elevated this quarter, driven by mark-to-market expenses related to significant appreciation in the equity markets this quarter. The mark-to-market of our deferred compensation liability and other equity based programs, increased expenses, primarily in G&A, consequently reducing our EBIT. However, due to the way we hedged this expense to reduce the volatility of earnings after tax, it is almost entirely offset in the tax line. In the quarterly presentation that is posted on our website, we show the third quarter details of this hedge.","Market-based compensation increased general and administrative expense by $5.5 million. Including the impact in restaurant labor I previously mentioned, total mark-to-market expenses reduced EBIT by $7 million and EBIT margin by 30 basis points this quarter. Our hedge reduced income tax expense by approximately $6 million, resulting in a net earnings after-tax impact of $900,000.","In quarters in which the overall equity market and\/or our stock price declines, the inverse relationship would be true, EBIT would have a positive benefit, while the tax line would be unfavorable. But, overall, earnings after-tax should be relatively flat.","Turning to income tax expense. We had an abnormally low performance-adjusted effective tax rate of 4.4% this quarter due to several factors. First, the application of the new lower tax rate in Q1 and Q2 earnings reduced our rate by 7 percentage points in the quarter. Next, the resolution of other tax matters reduced our quarterly rate by 4 percentage points. Both of these favorable impacts were contemplated in the updated guidance we provided in January. Finally, the impact from the deferred compensation hedge I just explained lowered the tax rate by approximately 4 percentage points. This was not contemplated in our January guidance. After adjusting for these three factors, our normalized tax rate for the quarter would have been approximately 19%.","Now to our segment performance. Olive Garden, LongHorn and the Fine Dining segment all grew sales in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurants. Segment profit margin increased in each of these segments, even at the incremental workforce investments by leveraging the same-restaurant sales growth and managing cost effectively. Sales grew 71.4% at the other business segment, primarily due to the addition of Cheddar\u2019s and new restaurant growth at the other brands as well as same-restaurant sales growth at Yard House and Bahama Breeze.","Similar to last year, segment profit margin was 250 basis points lower than last year -- last quarter, I\u2019m sorry, similar to last quarter. Segment profit margin was 250 basis points lower than last year due to the brand mix of impacting of adding Cheddar\u2019s and for moving consumer packaged goods out of this segment, primarily the Oliver Garden.","Additionally, with this morning\u2019s announcement, we increased our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share outlook to between $4.75 and $4.80 from the previous $4.70 to $4.78. This assumes approximately 126 million average shares adjusting for the year and is driven by same-restaurant sales growth of approximately 2%. New restaurant growth of approximately 40, not including the 11 Cheddar\u2019s franchise restaurants we acquired into Q2 and total sales growth of approximately 13%. We also updated our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 16.5%, down from approximately 18%. Finally, we brought our annual CapEx guide to the bottom end of the previous range at approximately $400 million.","Looking ahead, we wanted to provide some preliminary guidance for fiscal 2019. We currently anticipate total capital spending of between $425 million and $475 million, of which $225 million to $260 million is related to gross new restaurant openings of between 45 and 50, and $200 million to $215 million is related to ongoing restaurant maintenance, additional Olive Garden remodels, technology and other spending.","In addition to the CapEx and new unit guidance we typically give during our third quarter announcement, we are providing a few additional items for fiscal 2019, given tax reform and other unique modeling challenges. First, we anticipate our annual effective tax rate to range between 12% and 13%. We also expect to make an additional $15 million of investments related to the savings from the Tax Act. This is in addition to the $200 million of workforce investments we are making -- $20 million -- to the $20 million of additional workforce investments we are making in fiscal 2018, for a total annual run rate of $35 million in P&L investments. Finally, we expect diluted average common shares outstanding for fiscal 2019 to be approximately 125 million.","And with that, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, speakers. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Your line is now open. ","David Tarantino","Hi. Good morning. Gene, I just wanted to ask about your views on the current environment within casual dining and how you\u2019re viewing the underlying momentum in the business in light of sort of factoring out some of the weather issues as you noted. And then more, specifically, on Q4, you do have what looks like a tougher comparison, especially for Olive Garden. And you mentioned that you\u2019re not going to repeat the Buy One Take One promotion. So, just wondering about your thoughts on how we should expect the fourth quarter to play out and your ability to sustain positive momentum despite the tough comparison in eliminating that promotion?","Gene Lee","Yes. Good morning, David. Let\u2019s start with the industry. We are seeing a little bit of momentum there, little bit uptick in traffic. But, the real change that we\u2019re seeing, as we analyze the benchmarks is that the check average appears to be growing and has picked up some steam. And as we look at that, we\u2019re trying to analyze whether that is the industry taking more pricing, is it a pullback on some discounting, is it change in promotional strategy. At this point, we really don\u2019t have a good feel, but we do see that check average is up over 3% and it\u2019s been that way for almost the last 90 days. So, that\u2019s a significant move up.","And we\u2019ve seen a tick up in traffic but not at the same rate as overall sales. As far as the fourth quarter, I mean, we gave our guidance -- we think that we\u2019re comfortable in that range. We do have some tough laps. But, we think that we\u2019ve made -- we\u2019re making good long-term decisions. We think there\u2019s value in the menu. We think we\u2019re operating and executing at a high level. So, I think we\u2019re -- obviously, we\u2019re very comfortable with the guidance that we just put forth.","You know you did make the comments to introduce the fourth quarter weather issue. We have -- we\u2019ve been -- in this quarter and every week, we had a major snow impact for at least one day. I will add and I think added this during the hurricanes is that weather impacts today are greater than they were 5 or 10 years ago, because of the media hype around the situation. And so, kind of tough for us to -- and this would be the only common I\u2019ll make about fourth quarter. It\u2019s been tough for us to get any type of read around fourth quarter, because of the weather impacts in March.","David Tarantino","Just a follow-up, Gene. On the elimination of the Buy One Take One promotion, are you planning to run something else in place of that or is it a situation where you\u2019re not going to have a major promotion like that in the fourth quarter. And any way to gauge what the level impact from that factor alone would be\u2026","Gene Lee","No. I think we believe that we -- actually, we\u2019re going to run promotion. I mean, we have taken the promotional calendar; we\u2019ve gone from 9 to 6 promotions this year. We think that\u2019s a huge operational benefit. So, our promotional timing is not lining up exactly with last year. We do have great promotions at the start in two weeks. So, we think that will be really strong. As we change the promotional cadence or we also change on media cadence, which makes our ability to analyze our business week-to-week a little bit more difficult. But, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve got a group promotion for the back half of the fourth quarter. And we think we\u2019ve got the right media plan. And so, that\u2019s all but incorporating the guidance we gave you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brett Levy","Is there a number where you look at your same-store sales gap and outperformance where you start to get concerned? If you look at what we\u2019ve done -- if we look at what we\u2019ve seen for Olive Garden, it seems to be back to the beginning of your run about 10 quarters ago. And I\u2019m just -- when you think about labor, what can you do aside from just trying to drive greater retention? What can you do to offset the creep, either incremental training, incremental technology to try to help us get a better sense of what the leveragability is on that line? Thank you.","Gene Lee","As far as the gap would, I would point you back to our long-term framework and say that we\u2019re focused on trying to deliver between 1% and 3% same-restaurant sales on a consistent basis. And I know, there is a lot of attention and a lot of concern about our GAAP. I would point -- I\u2019d go back and look at a two-year stack, we didn\u2019t lose that much momentum on a two-year stack, also we lost a lot less momentum on the guest count. We appear to have a lot less price in our menu compared to our competitors, which we think is a really great thing and will play out over the long-term.","As far as labor goes, I think the key to labor is simplification. And we\u2019ll continue to try to simplify our menu, simplify our processes. And we\u2019ve done a good job. I thought the graph that Rick showed in his prepared remarks, shows that we are getting some productivity improvement to offset some of the wage rate increase. It\u2019s a line that I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to leverage here in the near-term. But, we\u2019re trying to keep it as flat as we possibly we can. And I look at our businesses. I\u2019m not so sure that there is a piece of equipment out there that\u2019s going to help us improve, or any technology is going to help us improve our efficiencies back there. My belief and my belief always be that it starts with your menu and it starts with all your processes and procedures as your products come in your back door. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to focus on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Anna Papp","Good morning. This is actually Anna Papp, representing Sara. So, I\u2019m surprised that how modest food inflation has been across the industry despite what appears to more significant increases in commodity prices. Can you remind us about how contracting plays into this and how we should think about the type of lag there might be between the commodity markets and your inputs? Because it seems like the industry is taking checkouts aggressively, as you say, and typically we\u2019d expect that to happen if costs [ph] are up. ","Gene Lee ","Yes. Anna, thanks for the question. On the commodity front, we contract at different times of the year. We\u2019ve got a great supply chain team that decides when the right time is to buy, looking at forward rates et cetera. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of commodity inflation. As we\u2019ve said, we were slightly below 1% in the quarter.","What I would say is more of the pricing you\u2019re seeing from some competitors is probably to cover the labor, not necessarily the commodities. What we also know is that as demand has picked up, supply has picked up. So, it\u2019s helped keep the commodities from inflating dramatically. And we also in our presentation show that we\u2019ve got inflation expected in the back -- in the last quarter in the low single digits. We\u2019ve got an appendix back there.","The one place we are seeing a little bit of inflation in the food is on the distribution side. It\u2019s getting a little bit tougher and tougher to find people to drive trucks. So, we\u2019re seeing a little bit of distribution expense, but that\u2019s driven by labor, not necessarily the food cost.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Brian Bittner","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Rick, I appreciate the initial look into 2019 on several line items. You highlighted the incremental investments of $15 million from the tax savings redeployment. But as we put all the pieces together for 2019, you didn\u2019t say anything regarding the Cheddar\u2019s synergies. What\u2019s the year-over-year benefit now expected related to that for 2019? And I have a follow-up.","Rick Cardenas","Yes. Brian, thanks for the question. In relation to Cheddar\u2019s synergies next year, what we said last quarter was we expect to be close to the run-rate by the fourth quarter of this year and we expect to have $22 million to $27 million of total synergies. So, doing the math, we\u2019re going to be a little below $15 million next year in incremental synergies. But we also now expect to be closer to the high end of our synergy range of the $22 million to $27 million. Hopefully that answers your question.","Brian Bittner","Yes. And just on the labor line, when you back out the investments in the mark-to-market stuff, the deleverage was close to like 90 basis points. That\u2019s more deleverage than we\u2019ve seen recently on that line. Is there something changing there, is inflation picking up relative to past quarters or anything else you can point to, just kind of changing the trend in that labor line?","Rick Cardenas","No, Brian, nothing is changing in the inflation. We\u2019re still seeing in the 4% to 5% wage inflation. And we did have a little bit of Cheddar\u2019s mix in there, more than we might have seen in the past, as we as we bring in more franchisees or we brought in the franchisees in Q2. But, other than that, there\u2019s really nothing dramatically different. We did have a little bit lower check growth and pricing in the quarter than we had in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Your line is now open.","Will Slabaugh","A question on Olive Garden. Did you more recent advertising campaigns around $8.99 dinners impact the mix of Kachina Me [ph] at all or even the rate of what you\u2019d call overall value mix? And if so, just curious on your thoughts, if you\u2019re okay with that and is that\u2019s the direction you want to go here?","Gene Lee","Yes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s had a lot of impact on Kachina Me [ph]. It\u2019s only rolling offering from 3 to 5. I mean, we see that -- Early Dinner Duos is just an opportunity to attract the clientele that is looking for value during really the only time when Olive Garden has some capacity. So, we see it as. Obviously, there is some people trading and they were coming in at 5.30, they\u2019re now coming at 4.45. But we think this is -- over the next couple of years, we think this is a real growth opportunity for us just to build this value visit for people who aren\u2019t really time-sensitivity around when they\u2019re eating. And we hope that over time, we\u2019ll just backfill anybody that we shift down into an earlier time zone. So, we think, this is a great way to offer value to our consumers in a period of time when our restaurants aren\u2019t very full.","Will Slabaugh","And just a quick clarification on the guidance, if I could. So, on the tax rate, I just wanted to clarify what you\u2019re implying for the fourth quarter. It looks like it\u2019d be closer to 20% and curious what the reason would be if it did climb that high?","Gene Lee","Well, if you hear the prepared remarks, we talked about what our normalized rate would have been in the third quarter. It was about 19. So, if you\u2019re doing the math to get to the 16 to 16.5 and you\u2019re getting to around 20, it\u2019s not really that different from what our rate would have been in Q3.","Operator","The next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","John Glass","I wanted to just go back to the change in the promotional cadence in Olive Garden. I guess, one, specifically, if you can talk about what you think that promotion or change in the promotion specifically might do to impact sales and you called that out. And maybe just more broadly, as you move from 9 to 6 promotions. Does that create -- is that the right number now as you think about 2019? And does that change for example the first half of 2019 as you think about lapping or uneven laps around promotional activity?","Gene Lee","I\u2019ll answer the last part of the question first. I mean, we\u2019ll not change the first part of next year. We\u2019ll have completely lapped this. We\u2019ve been working this all year. We haven\u2019t talked too much about it primarily for competitive reasons. We did want to call it out this time, because Buy One Take One is one of our most successful promotions. And we\u2019re not sure how we\u2019re going to be able to really -- how well we\u2019re going to be able to offset that. As far as giving some guidance into the fourth quarter, all I\u2019d point you back to is our guidance. We\u2019ve taken into account what we think the headwinds will be from removing that promotion, and it\u2019s in our full guidance. I\u2019m not going to give any more color on that. ","John Glass","And Rick, just two modeling questions, if you will. One is this mark-to-market program. Is this new? I haven\u2019t heard about it coming to be bear to before and there hasn\u2019t been market volatility before. So, is there a new program, we should just anticipate this from time-to-time or is this just the first time that surfaced as a call out? And then, I just want to make sure I understand the workforce reinvestment this year. You said $9 million this quarter, so an anticipated $11 million next quarter, the fourth quarter and then $15 million in 2019? I just want to make sure that is correct.","Rick Cardenas","Yes. The workforce investment was $9 million this quarter and it would be about $11 million in Q4. As far as the mark-to-market, it\u2019s not new -- it was just with the with the run up in the equity markets for our quarter was pretty significant on a one quarter basis and our stock price at the same time caused a lot more impact than mark to market that we\u2019ve seen before. We\u2019ve had this program going on for years but this was just a significant impact for us in this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Jeff Farmer","Thank you. Did you guys comment on the potential refi impact on interest expense as you head into FY19? Was that lower interest rates? Just trying to figure out; I think you gave us some interest rates, but what that might mean to actual interest expenses as you move into 2019 versus 2018?","Rick Cardenas","Yes. We didn\u2019t call it out, but if you do the math, it\u2019s about a $5 million net reduction in interest expense for next year when you include the fact that we had to take on a little bit of commercial paper. ","Jeff Farmer","Okay. And then, just one unrelated question. Turn appetites or philosophy toward pursuing acquisition of additional concepts in coming years. Any updated thinking on that?","Gene Lee","Yes. I think right now, we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re really focused on continuing the integration. And Cheddar\u2019s building the solid foundation for that brand and ensuring we get it on the right growth path before we consider doing anything else.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Matt DiFrisco","Thank you. I just have a follow-up and then a question. With respect to the fourth quarter change in the promotion also, I guess, it sounds like for lack -- for simplifying it you\u2019re losing a customer that was probably overly discounted in the first place. So, would that have a favorable affect to your labor margin? So, if you go back to Brian\u2019s question about the 90 basis points of deleverage, would the fourth quarter be set up to in theory have less deleverage because you\u2019re getting less promotional activity?","Gene Lee","No, that\u2019s exactly the opposite. Buy One Take One is a very, very profitable platform and it\u2019s not heavily discounted, because it is a prepared meal that\u2019s going home with the consumer and it goes home without soup, salad and breadsticks. So, the overall package -- it\u2019s very additive actually. So, it\u2019s a powerful driver -- guest driver and it\u2019s also on average, I believe it\u2019s an average type promotional construct.","Matt DiFrisco","Glad I asked the question. With respect to the $15 million in 2019. Can you give us a little bit of detail on where that will be deployed? Is that just purely higher wages or in what -- or is it more hours in essence or more service for the customer? I\u2019m wondering what type of customer facing things are sales driving benefits they could have with that $15 million investment.","Gene Lee","Yes. We\u2019re not -- as last quarter, we\u2019re not going to talk about the specifics of where those investment dollars are going to go. They\u2019re going to go to improve our overall experience for our guests or our team members. And for competitive reasons, we\u2019re not going to talk in a whole lot of detail about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Your line is now open. ","Gregory Francfort","I had two questions. One is just on the -- I think, you gave a labor bridge in the presentation. And one of the components was just the productivity of new restaurants. Are your new stores, I guess mixing significantly lower on labor and maybe what are they doing differently than your existing stores are doing? And maybe can you apply some of those learnings to the existing stores?","Rick Cardenas","Hey, Greg. This is Rick. The productivity is net of new restaurant. So, productivity was higher. We continue to add new restaurants into the mix. And when they come on board, they are not as efficient as they normally will be, as they move forward. So, productivity without new restaurants would have been higher than the 0.3 that we showed.","Gregory Francfort","And then, maybe Gene a question for you. Just on the Cheddar\u2019s comps, I remember you\u2019re saying at ICR, the Cheddar\u2019s comps would probably be negative for a while. But, it seems like this is mostly driven by franchise stores coming on the books and you guys maybe taking the average check down. Can you help me understand how you\u2019re thinking about how the Cheddar\u2019s business plays out in terms of comps? And maybe when this drag goes away from the franchise stores that have come on? Is that sort of early \u201819 sort of a dynamic or is that kind of an ongoing process?","Gene Lee","I think, it\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s an ongoing process. And when I look at the overall system, I think there is -- and I tried to allude to this in my prepared comments. This is a complex business; it\u2019s doing a lot of guests. And we believe after being involve now for almost the year, simplification is the key. We\u2019ve got to simplify the processes. In the restaurants that we\u2019ve recently acquired, I think we\u2019re really focused on the fundamentals. We\u2019re focused on getting -- continuing to develop great general managers in these businesses. We have some staffing challenges in the restaurants that we\u2019ve acquired recently. So, I think about getting back to basics and making sure we have the right management team in place, we have the right number of employees scheduled at the right time.","I think one of the things that we\u2019ve learned in this is when you buy a small franchisee where their owners aren\u2019t financiers, but they\u2019re really the operating owners and they operate the business and there is a lot of a motion is a heart and soul of these businesses. And when you remove them, you might have a little bit more turnover than you thought. You have a little bit -- you have some cultural issues. And it\u2019s going to take time to rebuild out and integrate those restaurants into a traditional corporate system. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re really going through.","These restaurants that we bought, I think there is 10 or 11 of them in Georgia. These are really high volume restaurants. And even with the significant decline, they\u2019re still at the system average after this. So, we\u2019re really excited about the opportunity to get in there. We have excess to resources in Atlanta, because of our huge base in our other businesses. So, it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. But, I would say that when we look at it, we\u2019re more optimistic today than were we bought the business about the opportunity.","So, we believe we can have a significant impact on basic restaurant operations and improve the overall delivery and get the experience to the consumer. I can\u2019t put a time table on it for you. You just need to know that we\u2019re working really hard doing these basic things. As I say, we\u2019re almost through the integration. Next year, we won\u2019t be talking about the integration. The management won\u2019t be even referring to integration of the restaurants. They\u2019ll be going to systems they know. So, I think we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. But, we\u2019re really excited about where we\u2019re at and what the opportunities are.","Operator","The next question comes from Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Fred Wightman","Hey, guys. It\u2019s actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. In the past, you\u2019d taken sort of a wait and see approach to any consumer benefits from the tax reform. Now that we\u2019re starting to see some increases in paychecks and take home pay and you\u2019ve talked about sort of that higher check average across the industry, do you think it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re seeing a tax benefit at the consumer level?","Gene Lee","I think, it\u2019s way too early to say that. And I would, again, based on the fact, the last three weeks we haven\u2019t had a week where we haven\u2019t had a significant interruption into our business because of weather. And so, I think it\u2019s my belief it\u2019ll take time for this extra incentive to get into -- get into our overall system, into our economy. But it\u2019s got to be good news as how much of it flows to us. And I\u2019ll go back to the well-positioned brands with great value equations are going to benefit. And I think that when I look at our portfolio, I think we have the opportunity to benefit from this.","Fred Wightman","Great. And then for that $15 million of investment next year, what\u2019s the cadence going to be like? Should that all hit in 1Q or should we see a 50-50 split, sort of like we saw this year?","Rick Cardenas","Fred, it\u2019s Rick. It should be spread pretty consistently throughout the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Penney from Hedge. Your line is now open.","Howard Penney","Thank you for the question. My question is also in the Olive Garden promotional change. In the past, when you\u2019ve changed promotion for previous -- the other brands and I\u2019m thinking about LongHorn, you may have compromised traffic trends in a certain quarter, but it significantly improved profitability because of the change in the promotional cadence, would you expect that too for Olive Garden?","Gene Lee","No. I think, we\u2019ve seen some of that throughout the year as we\u2019ve changed the cadence. I wouldn\u2019t expect at this point in time anything dramatically to change. LongHorn was a little bit different. We were coming off a deep value platform and going to a different type of offer. This is -- we\u2019re still in the same value range, it\u2019s just a different type of promotion. And we\u2019re -- we know that Buy One Take One was very, very successful. We believe that we are overexposing it. And just like Neverending Pasta, we only run that once a year. We need to run Buy One Take One once a year.","So, I wouldn\u2019t expect the big swing in profitability because of this change. Now where the profitability does come into play, as we move from 9 to 6 is from a labor standpoint. A0nd we\u2019re moving less product around. We\u2019re having less all team meetings to roll out new product. So that\u2019s been embedded in our P&L throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris O\u2019Cull from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Chris O\u2019Cull","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I had a follow-up to that last question. Gene, what have you seen in the data that causes you to be concerned that the Buy One Take One could be at risk of being overexposed? And I believe we are lapping that promotion right now. So, is that true and are there any other comparison issues we should think about for the quarter?","Gene Lee","No, we are -- you are correct. We\u2019re lapping that promotion from last year. I think it was more just our intuition that told us that long-term you\u2019ve got to protect the integrity of these promotions over time. And this is a great promotion. And we wanted to have its traffic drivability to continue on. And if you -- we know if we run it 16 weeks a year, it\u2019s going to lose some of its effectiveness. So, to me it\u2019s -- when you think about Neverending Pasta Bowl, it\u2019s a great promotion, but you got to run it once a year and you\u2019ve got to enjoy it once going on. And then, you\u2019ve got to take it away. To make it powerful, it\u2019s got to -- it can\u2019t be there all the time.","Chris O\u2019Cull","And then, Rick, thanks for the explanation on the G&A increase year-over-year. But, it looks like it\u2019s still -- you\u2019re running higher than the trend would suggest. Any other explanations for the G&A increase in the quarter and how much of the G&A increase do you expect to reoccur in the fourth?","Rick Cardenas","Yes, Chris. As we said, mark-to-market was about $5.5 million. And the workforce investment didn\u2019t just impact the restaurant labor line, it also impacted G&A $2 million to $3 million. So, if you take those things out, we\u2019re pretty -- we weren\u2019t that off where we were in Q2. So, we can\u2019t predict the stock market. So, we can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen in the fourth quarter on mark-to-market. But the workforce investment in the fourth quarter should be similar to what it was in the third quarter in the G&A line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Andrew Strelzik","I wanted to ask a question on the in-store business at Olive Garden. If I kind of back out the numbers you gave on off-premise, it seems like the in-store business was relatively flat, which is similar to the industry. Is that something that you\u2019re okay with? It just seems like -- I know you\u2019re taking less price but it seems like relative to the industry, the in-store business has been, the gap has been narrowing. And have you seen any change to the trade-off among in-store and off-premise as you saw -- continue to see the strong growth there?","Gene Lee","I would say that -- obviously, we\u2019re thrilled in-restaurant business is continuing. I think it actually grew, they\u2019re holding up all sign across the table here saying our in-store restaurant actually did grow a little bit, which is fantastic. And I think the analysis that you made was compared to the industry -- were equal to the industry. Well, the industry has got a lot of takeout growth in it too. So that\u2019s really not a fair comparison. However, we\u2019re focused on it in its totality. And when we think about Olive Garden, our goal is to deliver Olive Garden experience to people when and where they want it. We understand convenience is a big need state today. And so, we look at it in its totality.","So, I guess, I would go to a day like Valentine\u2019s Day, when there is no room to dine in Olive Garden, because we\u2019re so busy; it\u2019s our busiest takeout day of the year. And so, we\u2019re able to deliver an Olive Garden experience to the consumer in a way they want it. They can\u2019t get into the restaurant; they\u2019re going to take it home. So, I think trying to isolate the two different need states is I think on the stake. And we got to look at it in its totality. There is definitely a continued focus on off-premise. We\u2019re trying to maximize our opportunity there. But, we are really focused on making sure we\u2019re creating a great in-restaurant experience because that\u2019s the biggest part of our business. And our research tells us, the consumer is still looking for a great in-restaurant experience; and those who provide it, will continue to win.","Andrew Strelzik","I appreciate the perspective on that. If I could squeeze one more in on LongHorn actually. You\u2019ve seen price increases have been a bit lower the last couple of quarters, at the same time the mix has been ticking up. Is that a conscious decision on the pricing to manage the check growth and should we expect kind of a similar construct of check growth kind of as we progress...","Gene Lee","We are definitely trying to continue to create value to increasing the quality of the product in LongHorn and also watching what we\u2019re doing from a pricing standpoint. The mix is coming from a couple of components. It\u2019s coming from our simplification and we\u2019re actually selling more add-ons. But, the biggest part of it is a reduction in discounting. And as we reduce our discounting pressure, our menu mix goes positive, which is just another form of creating value for the guest. So, when I look at the LongHorn mix for the quarter, 2%, 0.7 [ph] price, flat guest counts and I\u2019m doing -- we\u2019re doing this with a lot less discounting, I feel really good.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","John Ivankoe","Hi. Thank you. I was curious about that the chain versus independent share dynamic. What you guys are seeing? And I asked this question in the context of there being some significantly conflicting data that\u2019s out there of whether -- who\u2019s taking share versus who\u2019s chains or independent. So, I wanted to get your thought on that. And also, if there\u2019s somewhat of an outlook on 2018 and 2019 as you guys have been through many different cycles before which side the pendulum switches in your opinion, chains or independents? ","Gene Lee","Yes. I am been briefed recently on the recent CREST data. And again, CREST data is directional. But, what we\u2019re seeing is large chains and independents picking up a little share and small chains actually donating that share. And so, that\u2019s the most recent trend. Not a huge swing. I mean, we\u2019re talking 10, 15, 20 basis points. There is not a lot of movement. But, it does seem like it\u2019s coming on the small chains with large chains and independents growing. As far as -- as we look into the future, I mean, that\u2019s hard -- I do think that the large players continue to have an advantage from a cost standpoint, from an advertising standpoint and will continue to -- should continue to take share, if we manage our businesses effectively.","John Ivankoe","And I asked this question also, Gene, just in the context of smaller, even one-off restaurants that have a better ability to market before and there is also a lot of discussion about there being some generational preferences for -- like the truly independent owner operator type of restaurants. So, but again, just relying on your experience in this case. Do you think that\u2019s true in 2018 or 2019 or if there\u2019s still a broadened swap of that population that appreciates a high level of consistency that just the overall industry, not necessarily Olive Garden and LongHorn can hold on to that share?","Gene Lee","Yes. Two thoughts, first of all, the independent growth, there\u2019s a coastal problem. It\u2019s happening on the coast; it\u2019s not really happening as much in Middle America. And secondly, I think that we\u2019re also at the top end of cycle. I think we saw this in \u201805, \u201806 and \u201807 where there\u2019s a lot of capital out there for people to open independent restaurants. And usually, independent growth slows down as that capital slows down. And a lot of these restaurants cannot withstand any type of shock. And as we saw in 2009 and 2010 and most a lot of them fell out. So, I think as we look forward, I think a lot is going to depend on the overall economic environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Anderson from Maxim Group. Your line is now open.","Stephen Anderson","Yes. Good morning. I wanted to discuss Cheddar\u2019s. And I thought you gave guidance on fiscal \u201819 CapEx. Do you have any kind of estimate as with regard to what you would like to spend to renovate some of the older Cheddar\u2019s that are out there? On the franchise side, there is still a lot older units that may not up to the current prototype? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Yes. I think, one of the things that we\u2019re most impressed with Cheddar\u2019s is the durability of their buildings. They\u2019ve got a great design that\u2019s been able to stand the test of time. And I don\u2019t think that -- there is not any type of remodel program that is needed. There is a little bit of refresh. We got to do some signage, changes. But for the most part, the buildings that we have bought are in great condition. We do have some transformational work in the kitchen with some new equipment that we\u2019re reporting into some restaurants and there will be some capital there, but that\u2019s minimal.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeremy Scott from Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Scott","Maybe just high level. I was wondering when we have a quarter like this with so many different weather events, how your takeout business performs and maybe you can -- I realize the 70 bps impact is across the board. But, just wondering, your comment that weather has in fact bigger impact today than it is five years ago, because of the media focus, some of that offset by the fact that you\u2019ve now laid the pipes primarily at Olive Garden to reach the customer\u2019s home. And then any changes in your thought process around delivery?","Gene Lee","Yes. First of all, I\u2019ll -- a lot in that question. But, I always say that weather hasn\u2019t helped us from a takeout standpoint either. I mean, it\u2019s -- we get to a certain point with this weather pattern that we\u2019re in where restaurants are close. We can\u2019t do takeout of a close. We take the safety of our team members very, very seriously and we close our restaurants, so that the takeout is not there.","The second part of the question around our attitude towards delivery. I would say that we have focused on Olive Garden on a large party catering. We see that as a huge opportunity. We\u2019re in the beginning parts of really starting to develop that. We are, again, as I\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re focused on these. The average order side is $300. As we continue to grow that business, it has some impact. We\u2019re still talking with a lot of third-party delivery companies trying to understand how this is all going to shake out. And we\u2019re testing, doing our own delivery. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of things happening right now. And we\u2019ll continue to analyze it and we\u2019ll make the right decision for our business. And we have the right -- we have enough information that leads us to a conclusion.","Jeremy Scott","Have you seen takeout growth in any of your other brands? I think, LongHorn the last time you mentioned was half of Olive Garden. How is that trended in the last couple of quarters?","Gene Lee","Yes. We\u2019re obviously seeing good takeout growth in all of our brands, especially LongHorn as the consumer demands convenience. And so, it\u2019s a significant part of the growth story in all of our businesses. But we\u2019re focused -- we still believe, we\u2019re focused on maximize the opportunity in Olive Garden, because the food travel is so well. And we have unique packaging. We have a unique product offering. And so, there is a lot more focus on really growing that. I would say in other businesses, we\u2019re going with the demand of the consumer and we think that\u2019s the place to be.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Brian Vaccaro","Thank you. Good morning. Gene, I wanted to follow up on John\u2019s industry question and also get your perspective on industry supply growth. It seems to be some indications that we\u2019re finally seeing some rationalization in recent quarters. And curious if that\u2019s consistent with what you\u2019re seeing and hearing from your teams in the field, and also your view on supply growth over the next couple of years.","Gene Lee","On supply growth, I think what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re seeing some rationalization and we\u2019re seeing some good growth. So, we\u2019re -- the last CREST data, I saw and it was recent was that we\u2019re basically a net -- no increase in restaurant growth year-over-year. But what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re seeing the weaker players start to close some restaurants; we\u2019re seeing some independents fall out; then, we\u2019re seeing new restaurants come back in. And the restaurant brands that are growing are strong and they are growing for a reason.","So, the example I like to use is when you open a yard house and we do $8.5 million in sales, we didn\u2019t create $8.5 million in sales in that marketplace, we stole that $8.5 million; it\u2019s been redistributed. And so, as we see these stronger players continue to open, it does put some additional pressure on the business.","I will tell you that the one thing I\u2019ve noticed in the last 12 months or so which gives me confidence that the environment is somewhat improving is that our new restaurants are performing better. And it does feed into our belief that we\u2019ve got to continue to build restaurants closer to where people live. They may be a little less likely to travel distances that they used to travel, especially to some of these malls, lose their drawing power. But, we\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised to the upside how well our new restaurants are opening. And that tells me a little bit about where we are economically.","Brian Vaccaro","That\u2019s helpful. And then, just two quick follow-ups, if I could. Rick, the cadence of the tax savings reinvestment, clearly we saw $9 million in the third quarter, $11 million expected in the fourth quarter. As we think about sort of the year on year impact, wouldn\u2019t the $15 million be sort of front-end loaded in fiscal 2019 or I\u2019m not thinking about that correctly?","Gene Lee","The $15 million wouldn\u2019t be front-end loaded in 2019, but we had no investments last year or this fiscal year in Q1 and Q2. So, we will see an increase. So, if you think about the $20 million that we made this year, just assume that\u2019s going to flow naturally through next year and then the $15 million will also start flowing naturally through next year, so. ","Brian Vaccaro","Got it. Okay, perfect. And then, last one for me, the weather that you\u2019ve seen in March, if you assume to April and May sort of normalized year on year, obviously not knock on wood, but how much of a weather headwind for the fourth quarter would that equate to? Would it be\u2026","Gene Lee","That\u2019s all incorporated in our guidance today. Again, we\u2019re hoping that -- you all in New York saw your last storm yesterday. We said that last week too. Weather is out of our control and there\u2019s nothing we can -- we don\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019re focused on running great restaurants; when we have a weather event, we\u2019re focused on ensuring our people are safe. And I think, as Rick said in his statement -- his comments, we saw more of a normalized winter through the third quarter. I mean -- and when get to the end of February and we looked at it, this is a normal winter. We\u2019ve got the benefit of a couple mild winters in the past couple of years. March may turn that upside down a little bit, but we\u2019ll give you some color in that in the fourth quarter when March is done.","Operator","The last question comes from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Matt DiFrisco","I just had a question with respect to the off-premise sales. I think you said it was about 13% or so. Is that got delivery in there? I\u2019ve seen you guys pop up a little bit more on Grubhub with Olive Garden and Yard House and some other brands, just curious, if you can give some comments on that.","Gene Lee","Yes, Matt. That\u2019s inclusive of all off-premise. And, yes, you are seeing us pop up either via test or we don\u2019t know that we\u2019re participating with them. They have a way of just taking the menus and marketing products. So yes, that\u2019s inclusive of anything, 13%. And I thought the number that\u2019s impressive was 15% of our total sales for the quarter were from takeout.","Matt DiFrisco","So, you don\u2019t have an agreement then with Olive Garden and Grubhub? They are just taking you and listening you on there?","Gene Lee","Well, it depends. In some markets we do. And yes, I mean, there is a little Wild Wild West out there right now.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. We show no further questions at this time. ","Kevin Kalicak","All right. Thank you. That concludes our call. I want to remind you that we plan to release fourth quarter results on Thursday, June 21st before the market opens with the conference call to follow.

","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you and you may begin.","Kevin Kalicak ","Thank you, Jay. Good morning and welcome everyone. With me today is Gene Lee, Darden's CEO, and Rick Cardenas, CFO.","As a reminder comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed earlier today, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. ","Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements and a reconciliation of these measurements is included in the presentation. We plan to release FY 2017 second quarter earnings on December 20 before the market opens, followed by a conference call.","This morning Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights. Rick will then provide more detail on our financial results from the first quarter and update our outlook for FY 2017. And then Gene will have some closing remarks before we open the call for your questions.","Now I'll turn the call over to Gene.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","[Technical Difficulty] \u2026keep going -- cultivate our results-oriented people culture to enable growth. We remain confident that we have the right strategies in place, both in the operating businesses and at the Darden level. And we continue to significantly increase market share as we execute against them.","Olive Garden's positive momentum continued during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 2%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 410 basis points. This was our eighth consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden.","The primary drivers of this performance include; one, our ongoing focus on flawless execution inside the restaurants. Our teams are working hard to get better every day which is reflected by the fact that our overall guest satisfaction scores rose to an all-time high during the quarter.","Two, the strong performance of OG ToGo. ToGo sales grew 20% compared to the same period last year and more than 50% on a three-year basis. And, three, culinary innovation. During the quarter we introduced dishes that build on brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, including pepperoni fettuccini and Italian pot pies.","Additionally, we continue to interact with our guests in a variety of ways. During the summer we surprised and delighted many guests by setting up our never-ending family table in multiple states across the country. It debuted at the High Line in New York City where we served 6,000 guests in four hours. This type of non-traditional marketing is popular with Millennials and leverages Olive Garden's strong emotional connection. The Olive Garden business is strong, and we remain laser focused on delivering exceptional experience for our guests.","LongHorn Steakhouse maintained its top line momentum and delivered significant profit growth during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 0.6%, the 14th consecutive quarter of growth outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 270 basis points.","We continue to focus on strengthening our in-restaurant execution to improve the guest experience. One way we are doing this is through operation simplification, which enables our team members to better focus on delivering a quality experience for our guests. Another way we're strengthening in-restaurant execution is through enhanced training for all culinary team members because we know perfectly grilled steaks are critical to a great steakhouse experience. This came to light during the quarter through our Steak Masters Challenge, a highly engaging training program and two month competition that began with 6,000 culinary team members and ended with the grill master Alex Alvarado being crowned as Steak Master champion. ","The team at LongHorn is focused on the right priorities and our research shows that we're making meaningful progress on multiple fronts.","Turning to our specialty restaurants; all five of our businesses continue to perform well and increase share, and each one is well positioned for growth as we build out our pipeline. The Bahama Breeze team delivered another strong quarter. Same-restaurant sales were up 3.9% as guests continued to respond positively to the enhancements we're making to create an immersive experience that feels like a tropical getaway.","Seasons 52 performed well with same-restaurant sales up 0.7%. We continue to be a leader in culinary innovation and the restaurant of choice for guests who are conscientious about what they eat but are not willing to compromise taste.","Same-restaurant sales were flat at Yard House. I really like what the team is working on as Mike Kneidinger gets further immersed in the business. Finally, The Capital Grille and Eddie V's same-restaurant sales were down 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively, wrapping on 7.2% and 5.1% same-restaurant sales growth last year. Not only did we anticipate this was going to be a difficult wrap for both brands, Texas continues to be a tough market for our fine dining brands. However, if you normalize for Memorial Day, which was observed in Q1 of this year but Q4 of fiscal 2015, the Capital Grille would have been positive.","Now I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss our results in more detail.","Ricardo Cardenas","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's first-quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. We returned more than a $0.25 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of more than $70 million in dividends and approximately $196 million in share repurchases. And as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to $500 million of Darden's outstanding common stock. This plan does not have an expiration date and it replaces the previous plan.","For clarity, we repurchased an additional $4 million worth of shares in the first week of the second quarter, which were still under the prior authorization, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $200 million. As a reminder, while our long-term framework reflects share repurchases of $100 million to $200 million per year, the actual amount of shares we repurchase in any given year could be higher or lower than that range, just like any of the elements in our framework.","Looking at key drivers of our earnings performance for the first quarter, we had sales leverage from our positive same-restaurant sales of 1.3%, a favorable commodities environment resulting in approximately 1.5% deflation in food and beverage expense, continued progress leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings throughout the P&L, and approximately 170 basis points of incremental restaurant rent expense and other taxes resulting from real estate transactions last year. Excluding these costs, the restaurant expense line would have been approximately 10 basis points favorable to last year.","In addition, below the restaurant level EBITDA line, we had depreciation and interest expense savings related to the real estate transactions, a planned gain of approximately $8 million, primarily related to the sale and closure of one Bahama Breeze restaurant. This transaction occurred in the first month of the fiscal quarter and was contemplated in the full fiscal 2017 earnings outlook we provided in June. And legal expenses that were unfavorable to our expectations by approximately $3 million, along with $2 million of support center rent expense and other taxes related to the sale leaseback. ","Excluding these expenses, G&A as a percent of total sales would have been 40 basis points favorable to last year's adjusted G&A expense.","Turning to segment performance, as a reminder, due to the real estate transactions last year, segment profit for the quarter includes incremental rent and other tax expense of $29 million. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit.","Olive Garden segment profit margin of 19.4% was 90 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 230 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding the incremental rent, Olive Garden's segment profit margin was 140 basis points higher than last year.","LongHorn Steakhouse continues to strengthen its business model, improving segment profit margin by 70 basis points this quarter to 15.6%, even with a headwind of 150 basis points related to additional rent expenses. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit margin increased 220 basis points at LongHorn.","Segment profit margin declined 90 basis points to 14.8% in our fine dining segment. Although margins were lower due to negative same-restaurant sales in the quarter, they were flat when excluding incremental rent expense and preopening costs, primarily related to two new Capital Grille openings in the quarter.","Our other business segment profit margins were down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis, as additional rents drove 60 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit margin at our other business was 50 basis points higher than last year.","Turning to our annual outlook, we increased our fiscal 2017 annual earnings per share range to be between $3.87 to $3.97, from our previous $3.80 to $3.90. This reflects an updated diluted average share count for the year of approximately 126 million shares, primarily as a result of higher than anticipated share repurchases in the first quarter as we took advantage of volatility in our stock price. All other aspects of our fiscal 2017 outlook remain unchanged, including our same-restaurant sales growth outlook of between 1% and 2%.","And while we don't provide specific quarterly guidance, I do want to remind you of a few timing-related factors that impact our quarter-to-quarter performance and comparisons to the prior year, specifically in the second quarter. First, in November we will lap the completion of our real estate transactions last year. As such, we will incur approximately two-thirds of the incremental quarterly rent and depreciation impact we've been experiencing. However, we will have essentially a full quarter's of interest savings relative to last year as most of the debt reduction related to our real estate transactions didn't occur until early in last year's third quarter.","Additionally, the G&A expense in the second quarter of last year was abnormally low due to a favorable legal settlement of approximately $13 million that we do not expect to recur. Finally, this favorable settlement was partially offset by approximately $8 million in asset impairments in the second quarter of last year, which is reported on the impairments line of our financial statements. As Gene mentioned, we are confident we have the right strategies in place. This is clearly evident in our sales outperformance versus the industry, while our teams continue to better manage their businesses and leverage Darden's scale to improve profitability.","We continue to believe Darden represents an attractive investment, given our strong cash flow generation, our investment grade credit rating with a compelling dividend yield, which is 3.65% based on yesterday's closing price, and, as we laid out in our long-term framework, our expectations for 10% to 15% total shareholder return over time.","And with that, I will turn it back over to Gene for some closing remarks.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Thanks, Rick. I was informed that I had a problem with my microphone as I opened. So I'm going to summarize my opening comments before I close.","Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance and the progress we made against our strategic initiatives in the quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.7 billion, an increase of 1.6%. Same-restaurant sales grew 1.3%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 340 basis points. And earnings per share were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings.","So overall, Q1 was a good quarter for us. Our strategy's working. We continue to grow share, improve margins and make meaningful investments in our business, while returning capital to shareholders. It was also an important time of year for us as we held our annual leadership conferences for each business. These conferences allow us to get in front of every General Manager and Managing Partner across our 1,539 restaurants to align on our plans for the year and generate a lot of excitement. For me personally, aside from being in our restaurants day-to-day, it's one of the things I enjoy most about my job. It's a great chance to engage with our leaders and listen to those closest to the action.","It also confirmed for me that our result-oriented people culture is truly what sets us apart. Our restaurant teams and our restaurant support center staff are the best in the business. And I take great pride in the fact that our team member turnover continues to be flat year-over-year, which reflects our compelling employment proposition. ","So I'll close by saying thank you to our team members who are at the heart of everything we do. And now we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris O'Cull, KeyBanc. Your line is you now open.","Chris O'Cull","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Gene, on the last call you indicated less menu pricing for the year than I believe what was maybe taken this first quarter. Has your thinking changed or do you expect less pricing in future quarters? And then I have a follow-up.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Good morning, Chris. I think we expect to price less in the back half of the year than we did in the front half of the year, as we had some pricing from the third and fourth quarter last year that's still on the menu that we haven't lapped yet.","Chris O'Cull","Okay. And then I know there had been some traffic growth embedded in the 1% to 2% comp guidance. But can't you achieve the guided range with slightly negative traffic and less pricing, given the contribution you're seeing from the off-premise sales growth?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Yes, I think that's true. I think that we're also having some more success with our add-on sales and other things that we're doing. But when you look at the Olive Garden number, you've got about between 50 to 60 basis points in there of mix that's really guest count, so it should be associated with guest counts.","Chris O'Cull","With the catering business?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Yes, with anything that's -- anything that's large container. So when we sell a pan of lasagna, we're not giving [ph] ourselves any guests.","Chris O'Cull","Okay. That's right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Levy, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brett Levy","Good morning. Can you please give us a little bit of incrementality on what you're thinking about the competitive landscape, and why Olive Garden performed so much better than the others, and, really, where you saw the pockets of softness across the other brands, whether it be on the value, the premium sides and regionality? Thank you.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Well I think I'd start, let me start pretty broad, Brett, and then I'll get down into our brands. I think the consumer environment, it continues to be difficult. I think there's a lot of choices the consumer has with their discretionary income. And I think restaurants are competing against a lot of those other choices, not just restaurants. I think restaurants today have to stay -- they have to stay relevant, and they need to continue to invest in the experience. And I believe that this quarter of outperformance has less to do with what we did this quarter but more to do with what we've done over the last two years to improve the overall experience in Olive Garden. ","We've been on this plan now for almost three years since Dave George has been involved, and everything cumulatively is adding up to our competitive advantage that we have in Olive Garden, which is value. And I think our advertising's relevant. I think, most importantly, we're running better restaurants today than we were in the past. And as you all know, this is a momentum business and I think this business has that momentum right now.","When I look at what you call weaknesses in the other business -- I'm not sure I want to use that word -- I think our businesses performed well. We had big gaps in the marketplace. And I think LongHorn had a really good quarter. When we look at LongHorn, we're giving you segment earnings now, we need to look at that number, the overall performance of that business is up. We needed that business to contribute more from an earnings standpoint. We're getting that. And I'm pleased with that.","When I look at -- let me give you a little bit of color, just based on geographic. Texas it still, it continues to be an area where we struggle. I would say Olive Garden continues to hold its own in Texas but the momentum has slidden there, too.","Brett Levy","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Buckley, Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Joseph Buckley","Hi. Thank you. First, a bookkeeping question. The $7.8 million gain, is that the normalized tax effect against that? Is that in effect about $0.05 a share in EPS?","Ricardo Cardenas","Joe, that's about $0.04 in EPS -- $0.03 to $0.04 in EPS.","Joseph Buckley","Okay. And then curious on the off-premise, if you could elaborate a little bit on that, how it's breaking down between ToGo and catering, if delivery's playing into that. And I realize the -- I expect, maybe I don't realize -- I expect the mix is going to vary somewhat seasonally by quarter. Could you share with us what the mix of off-premise was in this quarter?","Ricardo Cardenas","No, I'm really not going to share the mix for competitive reasons. Let me say that we've identified convenience as a huge opportunity. We've demonstrated that we've been able to pull that lever, take out \u2013 altogether it is -- up 50% over the last three years. What I will say is that we have momentum in the catering and delivery space but I'm not going to break down the components of our ToGo for competitive reasons.","Joseph Buckley","Okay. And maybe just one more then on LongHorn. Can you talk about what you're doing competitively? It seemed like the email coupons picked up during the quarter. Again, maybe that's seasonal, or I didn't know if you were getting a little bit more aggressive perhaps than you had been in the past couple of quarters.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Yes, let me address that because this is a strategy that we're implementing. We're executing this holistic marketing strategy and looking at all the tools we have available to us. As part of that, we've increased our digital spending in conjunction with our promotional strategy, which is really less broad scale discounting, and while using more targeted incentives to create value.","And you can see the results of that as you look at our check average over time. We're not giving up check average as we shift incentives from free-standing inserts to digital. Digital's a much more cost effective way to reach your consumer. As you take the value away from these price points and promotions, which were deep in LongHorn over the years, and you shift it to more of a targeted digital incentive, we think that's a much better way to go after this, and I think we can see it in our financial performance.","I would also just say the landscape on advertising and marketing is changing dramatically and we are constantly trying to find new ways and using our data scientists to analyze what is going on and what is the most cost-effective way to deliver the appropriate value to the right guests at the right time. We will continue to evolve this over the next probably 24 to 36 months as the environment continues to change.","Joseph Buckley","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tarantino, Baird. Your line is now open.","David Tarantino","Hi. Good morning. Gene, my question is about Olive Garden's relative performance versus the industry. If I look at the past several quarters, it looks like you saw a very sharp acceleration in the middle two quarters of last year in terms of your relative performance. My question is really about your degree of confidence in sustaining the type of relative performance you've been seeing in the upcoming quarters, given how difficult the comparisons are starting to get. And then I have a brief follow-up.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","That's a pretty tough question, David, in all honesty. We think that we're doing the right things. We're starting with focusing on the basics of the operation. I'm really impressed with Dan Kiernan, our head of operations and what he's done with that team to keep them motivated on trying to improve. Our guest feedback is at its highest levels ever. We think our promotional strategy moving forward is sound.","But do I feel confident that we're going to continue to outperform at the levels we've outperformed? I'm not sure. We're going to do the best we can but I can't predict that. I think we've got a good plan. I think we've done our work over the last few years and we'll continue to do our work. So, I think we're well positioned, but those are big hurdles to get over.","David Tarantino","Great. Then the quick follow-up, Gene, are you assuming that the industry trends get a little better than they have been recently or are you assuming more of the same as you look at the balance of the fiscal year? And then maybe the second part of the question is what do you think is needed for the industry trends to get better than what we've seen recently?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","I think there's a lot in that question, David. I would say that, as we think about the industry, we are preparing -- we prepare our plans, we assume the industry's going to stay where the industry's going to stay. We're not assuming that the industry's going to get a whole lot better.","I would say that my message to our team's let's focus on what we can control, running great restaurants and delivering great food service and atmosphere. I think there's some real uncertainty in the near term here but that's going to pass from a consumer standpoint. We're focused on the long term.","When you think about what's it going to take to move the whole industry, I don't know, I still look at there's a lot of great brands out there doing great things, growing sales and growing new restaurants and same-restaurant sales. I think they're well positioned. They've got good value equations.","I'm hoping that some more inventory will come out of the system. We've seen some big announcements of closures lately. And I also think there's other -- as you drive down the road, you're starting to see more restaurants close. You're also seeing more restaurants open. But we could use some inventory to come out. That would be helpful.","David Tarantino","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sara Senatore, Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Stephanie representing Sara Senatore. Good morning. A question on LongHorn. A lot of the conversation this quarter has been focused on gaining a certain mix of profitable customers. Now that you've had a bit of time to assess the data and the P&L and work on the strategy, has the profitability mix responded in the way that you expected it to? And if low beef prices were to persist, does this strategy still make sense? Thank you.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Yes, I think we're thrilled with the performance of LongHorn. Profitability has come back to historic norms. We've had 14 consecutive quarters of same-restaurant sales growth, significant outperformance over that time period, over the industry. So we've taken a lot of share. So we feel good about where we're at, at this point in time.","We'll continue to make investments. Yesterday, we made some huge investments into our business in LongHorn. We actually went back and increased the size of a couple of our steak [ph] that we felt we needed to and make that investment to get the quality where we need it to be. We improved our house salad yesterday. So, we're making investments in that business.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And a quick follow-up -- could you update us on your commodity outlook and if you're still expecting a return to inflation after this quarter; and, on a similar note, what that means for price competition within in the context of this environment?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","I heard the commodity outlook question. I didn't hear the second part of your question. Can you repeat that?","Unidentified Analyst","I was asking if you could update us on the commodity outlook and if you're still expecting a return to inflation after this quarter, and if you could talk about what that means for price competition.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Okay. We still expect commodities to inflate in the back half of the year, more towards the fourth quarter. But we do expect commodities to be flat to low single digits unfavorable for the year. And, as I said, this quarter we had 150 basis points of commodity deflation. So, you would see that we'd have some inflation in the back half of the year.","What does that mean to pricing? We still believe that we have the pricing strategy that's correct for us. Overall inflation for us, when you include labor and other things, is still going to be 1.5% to 2%. So, even though commodities are down in the beginning of the year and they're inflating in the back half, overall for the year we expect total inflation of 1.5% to 2%. As that relates to pricing, as we said, we expect to be in the low end of our 1% to 2% pricing this year. Olive Garden has taken their pricing action for the year already. And LongHorn just did this week -- earlier this month, I'm sorry. And so we don't expect to do much more with pricing for the rest of the year unless something dramatically changes.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh, Stephens. Your line is now open.","Billy Sherrill","Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Billy on for Will. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the labor line. You mentioned again last quarter the labor market remains tight across many of your markets. Do you have any updated thoughts that might be helpful for us? And should we still be thinking about that 2.5% to 3.5% wage inflation as appropriate, even headed into this new calendar year?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Yes, it's a good question. I think that your 3% assumption for wage rate in the back half of the year is probably the right assumption. The market continues to tighten. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're holding turnover flat year over year. We've got a strong employment proposition. Our people like what we do. We're a place people want to work. And so we'll continue to monitor the environment. We've changed some of our processes and procedures around hiring to help enable our restaurant managers to do a better job.","And most importantly, we'll continue to look for ways to improve productivity at the restaurant level. I've said it for two years now, simplicity is a key to success in this business. We've made these businesses too complicated and we can get productivity enhancements as we simplify.","Billy Sherrill","Thanks. That's helpful. And then just one more if I could, kind of taking a step back. I wanted to ask on possible acquisition opportunities. Do you guys have any updated thoughts here? Lately as we've seen valuations come in across the space, your balance sheet seems to be in a good place. So I guess, is there any reason why something like that would be off the table if a good opportunity presented itself?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","As I've said in the past, the management team and the Board will regularly evaluate all the alternatives open to us to achieve our financial goals and we will continue to do that. I'm not going to make any further comment than that.","Billy Sherrill","Got it. Thanks. That's helpful.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Jay, we are ready for our next caller. ","Operator","Yes, our next question comes from David Palmer, RBC. Your line is now open.","David Palmer","Thank you. Gene, first a follow-up on Joe's question earlier. Last quarter the take-out catering mix was a little under 11%. Are you updating that number? Can you give that number for the quarter?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Total take-out was 11%, it was 11% of the business.","David Palmer","Thank you. And the discount that I was getting on our adjusted email list -- and I know we're a sample of one and we were seeing online orders that was being marketed at 20% discount versus the traditional pricing. It seems like an important initiative for Olive Garden to get people into that habit, at least for take-out. Can you maybe walk us through the rationale of doing discounts like that? Perhaps it just makes sense on a mix basis given the saved labor and other, and maybe there's a growing base of web marketing that you can get from that.","And then if I could squeeze one more in, is online ordering of delivery for individual orders in your future and how distant could that be? Thanks.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","A lot there. Let me deal with the first one and hopefully I'll remember the second one. We believe that it's important to move as many people as we possibly can over to online ordering. We've talked about the importance of that because the average check is much higher when someone orders online and we can prompt them through that order.","But secondarily, from an operations standpoint it's really important, if we can move people off the phone taking orders to serving guests in the restaurant, that's really helpful. And when you think about, we have a ToGo specialist, one, two or three, and they're on the phone taking an order and there's a guest in front of them, the priority becomes the guest in front of them, not the person on the phone.","So we feel like the service experience is a lot better as we move people to online. And we will continue to incentivize people to get in that habit. And we believe that the 20% discount, to do that is well worth it until we can change the behavior. The second question was individual order delivery. Yes, we will continue -- we are monitoring what is going on in that space. We are intimately involved with the big players that are in that space. They need us, we need them. We're going to proceed with caution.","However, individual delivery orders are coming in the future somehow, some way. We just don't know who's going to be our partner, what the economics are going to be at this time.","David Palmer","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Karen Holthouse, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Karen Holthouse","Hi. Another question on the ToGo business. As you started to move people onto a digital platform and have a little bit better sort of tracking of who's ordering what, do you have any numbers around frequency you'd be willing to share, or any suggestion that people are using large order delivery or large order take-out as almost a home meal replacement option versus a catering occasion?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","I'm not going to get into a whole lot of detail, again, for competitive reasons. But they are using it for all different occasions. They're using it as a whole meal replacement. They're using it -- catering's a big word, but you've got a minimum of $125, I believe, on the Olive Garden take-out. Some families that's a family meal, if it's a large family. So it's being used for all sorts of occasions.","I would tell you that the satisfaction rate is incredibly high for anybody that uses these services. Obviously we're trying to monitor every single event and trying to get feedback from the consumer. But right now the consumer feedback is extremely high and they're very satisfied.","Karen Holthouse","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Brian Bittner","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just on the financial stuff, what's your calculated debt-to-EBITDAR ratio today? And how does that relate to your targeted range? And if it's below your targeted range, could you dip into this low interest revolver you have? I think you have $750 million of untapped availability there. Could you dip into that to help accelerate these repurchases?","Ricardo Cardenas","Hey, Brian. It's Rick. Our debt-to-EBITDAR ratio right now is slightly under 2% and our long-term framework is 2% to 2.5%. We do have a $750 million revolver.","That doesn't mean that we're going to dip into it. We'll continue to work with the Board on figuring out what the best use of our capital is. If the stock price becomes volatile, we'll take advantage of that. But that's probably about as far as we'll go in talking about how much we're going to buy back.","Brian Bittner","Okay. Just going back to this ToGo business, I think it's probably one of the main incremental drivers to your outperformance against the industry. And just still trying to fully understand what it is that sets you so far apart in this piece of your business relative to your competitors. Obviously the food appears to be more portable than others. But if you could just maybe hit a little bit more on what it is that you're doing to drive the incrementality there, and what's setting you apart on the ToGo business versus your peers.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","I think you hit on one of the most important ones, which is that the food travels really well. But I also think it's important to note that Olive Garden is under-indexed on Italian take-out for a long time. We think it was a huge opportunity for us to really promote and make people aware of what's available. And I think we're still, we're scratching the surface on how we market this and I think the opportunity is large. When you think about, even when we look at our other businesses and what the take-out opportunities are, they're not as great. Olive Garden, because of the food, you can you do a pan of lasagna, you can do a pan of fettuccini Alfredo. The cuisine lends itself to a take-out type of event. I think that's part of why we're having so much success there.","We've got food, we under-indexed, and I think we're marketing it very effectively. And we've got a consumer that wants it. The consumer wants the convenience. ","Brian Bittner","As you go forward and continue to talk to us about ToGo, is catering going to be lumped into the ToGo conversation? Are those all going to be talked about as one?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Yes, Brian, they're all one. I really want to reel this in for competitive reasons.","Brian Bittner","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco, Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. I have a question about the other side of the outperformance. I guess if you look, both brands seem to have, both LongHorn and Olive Garden, seem to have outperformed roughly about 200 basis points if you wipe away the benefit that you're getting from the growth, the 20% growth in take-out and catering. So I guess is that a reflection of not only the value but is that also a reflection of dinner? If you could talk about what you're seeing across the industry, both your brands have historically indexed a little bit more towards dinner than some of your Malcolm Knapp casual dining peer group. So I'm curious if the competition seems to be a little bit heavier that you're seeing at the lunch day part.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Actually, we're seeing some decent growth at Olive Garden for lunch. I think if you go to an Olive Garden, you look at our lunch menu, there's only five or six price points on the front of that menu, except for the bottom part, and they're all below $9.99 in most parts of the country. So we've seen some good growth there at lunch. And dinner remains strong. I hate to keep pivoting back to this. I know that you guys don't like to hear it. But we're so focused on improving the restaurant visit for the guest at each individual restaurant.","Operations is driving some of this growth. I can't emphasize that enough. This is a very difficult business to execute at a broad level. And we've done a great job focusing our teams on that. And I think that's what's driving growth.","Matthew DiFrisco","That's great. Also, can you just talk a little bit about, as far as if I look at the margin side, when do we get to the point, or are we at the point, where take-out is, across the board, sort of being agnostic as to whether it's a order pick-up or catering, is it a higher margin than your in-store visit even with the potential discounting or marketing needed to drive the business? Are we seeing this as a positive flow-through on the margins, as well, on the mix effect?","Ricardo Cardenas","Yes, Matt, this is Rick. We're still saying that our margins are neutral to what our in-restaurants are. A lot of it is because of the alcohol and the other beverages that you can sell in restaurants. Even though we do have a higher check on our ToGo business, we've got a lower margin on the food than on the alcohol.","Matthew DiFrisco","And then just a last follow-up on that, where do you stand as far as testing across some markets, potentially delivery with some third parties?","Ricardo Cardenas","We're testing. We're looking at different third parties. We're not really wanting to talk about our testing for competitive reasons. But as Gene mentioned, we're talking to a lot of these deliverers to see which one is going to win out.","Matthew DiFrisco","Is it meaningful, though, to the growth that you're seeing now across enough stores that it's affecting the year-over-year growth rate that you're seeing in take-out and off-premise?","Ricardo Cardenas","No, no. The only delivery that's meaningful in our growth is our catering delivery that we're doing ourselves.","Matthew DiFrisco","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Glass, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","John Glass","Thanks very much. Gene, food deflation, and particularly food at home deflation, has been cited as one of the key reasons why restaurant sales have been weak recently. And that makes sense sort of intellectually, but I don't think I've ever really seen it happen, at least to this extent. So do you believe in that? Do you see it in your own data when you either talk to customers or survey customers that they're actually preferring to eat at home now instead of dining out because of that?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","John, obviously I was prepared for that question because it's being asked a lot of my peers. The way I think about this, John, it has to be a headwind for the entire industry. When I say the industry, I'm lumping fast food and other pieces in there. It's really hard for me to quantify the impact on casual dining.","When I take the week-to-week noise out of the benchmarks, casual dining's down a little bit more than 1%, whether you look at it from a 13-week or 26-week or 52-week trend. So, when I look back over the year, as this spread has started to happen, I haven't seen a whole lot of difference in the trend. There's noise week to week but I like looking at these benchmarks on more of a trend to see what's happening, and try not to get too excited about what goes on week to week.","I just have a hard time, when you think about our brands, that, where they're experiential, that people are trading out and staying home because they can get their groceries a little bit cheaper. I'm just having a hard time with that.","John Glass","Got it. You mentioned some of the higher end brands that struggled. Do you see the higher-end consumer in, say, Olive Garden or LongHorn changing their behavior? If you look at your customers by that segment, are they ordering less or visiting less, maybe you're picking up lower-end consumers, or maybe you're getting the benefit of trade-down? How do you see the high end interacting with your main brands?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","I don't see, really, any interaction there. I don't see any change in behavior. I think when we look at The Capital Grille sales for the quarter, the one thing I didn't mention in my prepared remarks, we had some shift in the restaurant charity weeks that moved back into September, which are huge weeks for us. So those businesses, when you look at them on a longer-term trend, are performing really well.","So I don't see any change in the upscale consumer behavior at this point in time, other than Texas. Texas continues to be weak. We're going to lap that here pretty shortly. But I haven't seen any -- it's not like the higher-end consumer is trading down. ","I think -- we look at -- again we set out two years ago to try to increase frequency in Olive Garden. We thought that was the play. We thought we spent too much time trying to increase our reach. We went back to try to increase our frequency and stay focused on our core. I think that's what we're doing. We're driving more core business.","John Glass","Got it. And, Rick, just one quick one. You mentioned the one-time gain this quarter was in your guidance. I just feel compelled to ask, is there anything else in that guidance that we may not normally anticipate for the balance of the year?","Ricardo Cardenas","Other than the things that I told you that happened last year, I wouldn't see there's anything very different than normal year-to-year stuff.","John Glass","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein at Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. One, Gene, just on the comp trends, I'm just wondering from your seat, the sequential trends you look at, and I know we talked about shifts this year and last, more so last I guess, but would you say that trends through this quarter, ex those shifts were stable, or perhaps you saw any kind of trend one way or the other?","I think you also mentioned something about when you think about the broader category that you're competing against broader consumer discretionary. So I'm just wondering, when you put that aside for a second, just from your restaurant peers how would you assess that competitive landscape, whether it's getting better or worse in terms of the discounting. And then I had a follow-up.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Jeff, I would say, again, I think, when you look at month to month, we've got promotional changes in there where we've got different tests going on with incentives. So, I don't get too worried about what's going on month to month. I'm kept fairly well informed of exactly what's in market and being tested and what to expect.","We're pretty good at predicting when we're going to be a little bit weaker versus last year and then when we're going to make it up. When you look at LongHorn for the quarter we are right on our plan. We planned to be at 0.6% and we were at 0.6%. We nailed the plan based on what we're doing with the marketing schedule. ","As far as the competitors, there's a lot of talk about it being very promotional. I would just urge you to go back and look at the benchmarks and see that there's still a 2% to 2.5% gap between -- we phrase it this way -- the consumer's paying 2.5% more this year than they did last year. And that's been true for seven years. For me, we haven't really seen a real promotional environment since the great recession. There was an 18-month period there where we saw a lot of promotional activity when check average was actually less than guest counts. But since then we've been adding between 2% and 3% to the consumer every single month.","People say it's promotional. I'm not so sure that the consumer believes it's promotional because they're still paying 2.5% more.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got it. And then just to clarify, I know in your slide deck you talked about the cost saves. I think you said $30 million in fiscal 2017. I'm just wondering whether you can provide any color in terms of the components of that. Are we now going forward in a state where we should be expecting savings in that range, and the low-hanging fruit of the $100 million-and-some-odd over the past couple years are now in the past, and this is the new normal run rate?","Ricardo Cardenas","Jeff, just big picture on the cost saves, since Gene's been the CEO, we've taken about $160 million out of costs out of the business. Yes, a lot of that was early low-hanging fruit. We're continuing to look for other areas of productivity enhancements that we can get. We do expect $30 million this fiscal year. And as we said in June, if we get more than $30 million, we'll decide whether we want to reinvest those savings into our consumers so that we can improve our value perceptions. ","But we're going to continue every year to look for more productivity enhancements. I can't tell you what the savings will be in 2018 and 2019. We are still working through those. But if we have an update we'll give you one when we have one.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason West, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jason West","Yes, thanks. Just one quick one first and then a follow-up. You guys mentioned the Memorial Day shift, I think, impacted the fine dining business in the quarter. But it didn't sound like it impacted any of the other brands. Can you just explain what happened there?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","It was de minimis in the other brands. It was almost 100 basis points in Capital Grille approximately. But the other brands were de minimis.","Jason West","Okay. Got it. And then just big picture, on the two big brands there, you saw some strength at the end of the quarter in August. Could you try to just clarify how much of that was maybe promotional timing, things like that, maybe the pricing timing, versus if you are seeing any signs of improvement out there with just the general consumer, would be helpful? Thanks.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","I wouldn't read too much into August. Schools start differently every year, the calendar, we had some promotional changes. There was a lot going on in August. And we could tell in certain areas what schools went back before Labor Day. There were big changes in the school schedule. So I would look more at the quarter number than the month number.","Jason West","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole Miller, Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Nicole Miller","Thanks. Good morning. Could you update your potential new unit growth opportunity? And when we look back at the growth targets, I think you outlined in one of your investor decks in the spring or summer, do those represent both Company units and JV or franchise units?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Nicole, what we said earlier in June was we'd expect 24 to 28 new units this fiscal year. We still expect to be within that range, 24 to 28. Now, I'm going to take you back to our long-term framework. Our long-term framework is 2% to 3% new unit growth. And as we said, early on in this long term, we'll be below that. But that does include just company-owned. That does not include any JV or any franchising sales growth for new units.","Nicole Miller","And any -- would any international, outside the US, be contemplated in that?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","No, international is all franchising. So that's not contemplated in the 2% to 3%. That would all be upside.","Nicole Miller","Thank you. And then just as a quick follow-up, in some of our field checks we've noticed a very heavy family mix, really tables with like very large families lately. Have you noted that customer mix change, as well, and does it have any impact?","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Yes, Nicole, we really haven't noticed a big change in family mix. Olive Garden's always had a larger family presence, anyway. So, we haven't really noticed a big change in mix in families.","Nicole Miller","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ivankoe, JPMC. Your line is now open.","Alexander Mergard","Hi. Thank you for the question. This is Alex Mergard on for John. A quick question on Olive Garden remodel CapEx. I believe it was mentioned previously that you're targeting 62 for the year at about $250,000 a unit. Can you provide a quick update on where you stand at the end of the quarter and also your initial take for 2018? Thanks.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Yes, Alex, we're still on track to hit our 60 roughly remodels for this fiscal year and we expect to do about 60 next fiscal year. We're still determining whether we want to accelerate that or not. But right now we're at 60 this year, roughly 60 next year, and then we'd be done with the year after at 60. They're running $250,000 to $450,000 in our total cost of remodels. But we're still on track for our 60 this year.","Alexander Mergard","All right. Great. And then one quick follow-up question. Going back to the longer-term opportunity you mentioned accelerating development, perhaps, in 2018, particularly in your other business brands. Would you say that's still the framework for ramping development? Or could it be sooner? Later? Any clarity there would be great. Thanks.","Eugene I. Lee Jr.","Alex, the other brands, you're talking about, the smaller brands on ramping up development, we believe that all of our brands have room to grow. It takes a little bit longer for those smaller, more specialty brands to build a pipeline. So when we kind of slowed the pipeline down a couple of years ago, some of these take 24 to 36 months to get open. What we talked about, our long-term framework on new units, was we expect to be below that long-term framework early and start ramping up for that. The good news is these specialty brands are higher sales volumes than an average Darden restaurant. So even if we open one or two, it's like opening three or four LongHorns.","Again, we expect to be at the low end this year, or below the low end of our long-term framework for new units. And when we talk about 2018, we'll let you know when we get that sometime later this fiscal year.","Alexander Mergard","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

You may begin.","Kevin Kalicak","Thank you, Hans. Good morning and welcome everyone. With me today is Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO and Rick Cardenas, CFO.","As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company\u2019s press release, which was distributed earlier today and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com.","Today\u2019s discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliation of these measurements is included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and year end earnings on Thursday, June 30 before the market opens followed by a conference call.","This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and brand highlights. Rick will then provide more detail on our financial results from the third quarter, as well as an update on our expectations for fiscal 2016 and then we will open the call for your questions.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. Let me start by saying how excited I am to have Rick with me this morning as our new Chief Financial Officer. Rick\u2019s extensive experience and proven track record of results leading finance, operations, IT and strategy during a 25 plus year career at Darden. In addition to his consulting experience with Bain & Company and the Parthenon Group make him uniquely qualified for this role. Also, I want to point out that just as we did last quarter, we reported same restaurant sales on both the fiscal and a comparable calendar basis. This morning, I will refer to the comparable calendar comps during my remarks.","We had another solid quarter, with great same restaurant sales and significant operating margin improvements. Our operations focused philosophy continues to drive strong performance across our brands and we are gaining significant shares as a result. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.85 billion, a 6.7% increase from the third quarter last year. Each of our brands delivered strong same restaurant sales growth during the quarter and we added 7 net new restaurants.","Olive Garden\u2019s positive sales and earnings momentum continued during the quarter. Same restaurant sales grew 4.9%, outperforming the industry, excluding Darden, by more than 600 basis points. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden. In addition, same restaurant traffic was up 3% for the quarter. Key drivers of this performance include an improved guest experience delivered through proper staffing and the simplification of processes and procedures; culinary innovation that builds on the brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, as seen with our successful flavorful pastas and Create Your Own Tour of Italy promotions; and continuing to meet our guests\u2019 needs for convenience, with the national launch of large party catering delivery. This is an enhancement of our successful OG To Go platform, which has experienced a 2-year growth rate of over 40%. Year-to-date, OG To Go sales represent 10.5% of our total sales.","We are confident that our overarching strategy continues to be effective. Our focus on food, service and atmosphere, has improved the perceived value of the Olive Garden dining experience. We have anchored our lunch and dinner menus with compelling price points, $6.99 at lunch and $9.99 at dinner, which provides everyday affordability. This enables us to deliver promotional value with a wide range of price points. Olive Garden\u2019s relentless focus on delivering great guest experiences will allow us to further enhance our perceived value. This will continue to be the key to our ongoing strategy as we build on the momentum we are experiencing.","LongHorn Steakhouse\u2019s sales momentum continued throughout the quarter. Same restaurant sales grew 2.7%, the 12th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry, excluding Darden, by over 400 basis points. Same restaurant traffic was slightly negative. However, our performance is well above the industry average. We pulled back on our price-pointed activity and optimized our media spend to be more effective, which contributed to LongHorn\u2019s 29% increase in segment profit and helped to offset the incremental expenses associated with the recently completed real estate transactions. Additionally, we will continue to invest in menu enhancements and reallocating labor as we further simplify operations and optimize our media spending. Finally, LongHorn continues to deliver communication that resonates with our guests through its You Can\u2019t Fake Steak advertising campaign, which was recognized in December when Ace Metrix named LongHorn, the Brand of the Year for casual dining for the second year in a row.","Turning to our specialty restaurants, we saw positive same restaurant sales growth across all five brands, led by Bahama Breeze at 6.3% and Seasons 52 at 5.3%. Bahama Breeze continues to significantly outperform the casual dining industry as consumers are reacting favorably to operational improvements and culinary innovation. I am impressed with the progress the leadership team continues to make. Additionally, Seasons 52 had another strong quarter, making meaningful improvements to the business as we have temporarily slowed new restaurant growth, enabling us to improve our operational execution and evolve our menu. We are encouraged by the positive reaction our guests are showing to the changes we are making. We are excited about the momentum we have gained and we started to rebuild our pipeline for new restaurants. Yard House, the Capital Grille and Eddie V also had strong quarters. Although Eddie V\u2019s same restaurant sales were impacted by a significant slowdown in fine dining within Texas. Overall, I am pleased with our performance this quarter. Our strategy is working and we continue to grow market share, improve margins and return capital to shareholders.","And with that, I will turn it over to Rick.","Rick Cardenas","Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. It\u2019s great to discuss our business results with you today. Darden\u2019s third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.21, an increase of $0.22 or 22% higher than last year. Year-to-date, adjusted EPS growth is over 50%. While Gene referred to the comparable calendar of same restaurant sales to better highlight our quarterly sales trends, it was our strong fiscal same restaurant sales of 6.2% and the continued improvement in core operating performance that drove our earnings growth and more than offset the incremental ongoing real estate expenses this quarter. The strong cash generation inherent in our business model enabled significant return of capital to our shareholders. We paid $64 million in dividends this quarter. We also repurchased approximately $140 million of Darden stock. This leaves $360 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization that we announced in December.","Third quarter reported earnings per share were adjusted by $0.34 of cost associated with the early retirement of debt this quarter and $0.03 of implementation cost associated with our strategic real estate plan. Separately, the ongoing impacts of the real estate transactions are now reflected in the financial results for the entire quarter, reducing pre-tax earnings by $6 million and earnings per share by $0.03.","Looking at the specific impacts, we incurred incremental rent and other tax expenses of approximately $32 million. Depreciation and amortization was lower by $15 million and interest expense was [$1-11] [ph] million lower due to debt reduction of over $1 billion. As a result of this debt reduction, we now have $450 million of outstanding funded debt, with maturities due in 2035 and 2037. The company\u2019s adjusted EBIT margins increased by 200 basis points this quarter as a result of leveraging positive same restaurant sales, continued progress on our cost reduction initiatives and seafood, beef and natural gas deflation, all of which helped to more than offset the ongoing incremental real estate expenses I detailed a moment ago most of which is included in restaurant expenses.","Before discussing our performance by segment, I want to remind you that the fiscal 2016 segment profit now includes the incremental rent and other tax expense associated with the real estate transactions, whereas fiscal 2015 did not include these costs. Additionally, the benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. Olive Garden segment profit of $220.1 million was $18.7 million higher than last year and continued their strong segment profit margins of 21.6%. In addition to Olive Garden, all of our segments significantly improved quarterly profit, led by LongHorn Steakhouse\u2019s segment profit growth of $19.1 million versus last year, which as Gene mentioned, is 29% higher than last year and segment profit margin increased almost 400 basis points to 20%.","Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2016, we are increasing our range for same restaurant sales to 3% to 3.5%. We are also increasing our range for adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to $3.48 to $3.52. Given the strong performance this year, our annual effective tax rate is expected to be at the high-end of our previously communicated range of between 23% and 25%.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we have begun to ramp up the development pipeline for future sites and we anticipate 24 to 28 new restaurant openings. We expect to complete at least 60 Olive Garden remodels with an investment of between $250,000 and $450,000 each. And we will continue our bar refresh program, completing up to 150 next year. The bar refresh investment of approximately $20,000 per restaurant significantly improves the utilization of our older Olive Garden caf\u00e9 and bar areas and is a component of our larger remodel package. We have seen a solid return on the remodel and bar refresh investments to-date. Additionally, to ensure all of our restaurants are well-maintained, we invest roughly $60,000 per year, per restaurant in annual capital spending.","Total capital spending for 2017 fiscal is estimated between $310 million and $350 million, of which $110 million to $130 million is related to new unit openings and the remainder related to remodels, the bar refresh program, maintenance, technology and other spending. Additional guidance for our 2017 performance will be shared in next quarter\u2019s release and conference call in June. However, I would like to take this time to remind you of the long-term framework we have for value creation.","Over time, we believe our business can deliver total annual shareholder returns of 10% to 15%, which is composed of earnings after-tax growth of 7% to 10%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 1% to 3%; new restaurant growth of 2% to 3%; and EBIT margin expansion of 10 to 40 basis points, by leveraging sales growth and our significant scale. Additionally, given the strong cash generation of our business and the earnings growth expectations, we anticipate return of cash to our shareholders in the 3% to 5% range annually, consisting of a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% and share repurchases of $100 million to $200 million. We believe the 10% to 15% total shareholder return represents a healthy and attractive investment.","Finally, I am excited to be speaking with you this morning. Darden has been a huge part of my life for over 25 years and I am humbled by the opportunity to serve as the CFO of this dynamic organization. I also want to share with you how I am approaching this role. First and foremost, my diverse experiences working within the brands, including my time and operations gives me a deep understanding of our restaurants and the ability to partner with the leaders in the business. Also my experiences away from Darden, as a management consultant, help me maintain a strategic and external focus to ensure that we are not overly insular. In this role, I will be focused on ensuring we leverage our significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and a disciplined capital allocation approach, ensuring that every dollar we spend will be a dollar worth spending to deliver on the long-term value creation framework I just reviewed with you. This role comes with the pleasure of developing strong relationships with our analysts and investors and I look forward to strengthening that relationship.","And with that, I will turn it over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thank you, Rick. As you saw this morning, Jeff Smith informed the Board of Directors last night that he was stepping down as Chairman and resigning as an Independent Director. I want to take this moment to thank Jeff on behalf of the board and the Darden management team for his leadership and partnership. From the moment he walked into the boardroom, Jeff has been focused on helping Darden regain its leadership position in full-service dining and we are all grateful for his perspective he has brought to our business. We have accomplished a number of extraordinary feats under his leadership, including improved operational excellence, disciplined strategic planning and the spin-off of Four Corners Property Trust. On a personal note, I have appreciated in value Jeff\u2019s vision, constructive attitude and counsel during the past 18 months. He has been a wonderful partner for me and I wish him well in all his personal and professional endeavors.","We also announced that Darden Board of Directors unanimously elected Chuck Sonsteby as Chairman. Chuck is a proven leader with extensive industry experience and I am looking forward to working with him in his new capacity as Chair. Darden has regained momentum and I am excited about the opportunities ahead for our brands and for our team members as we continue to focus on delivering exceptional guest experiences. We have an engaged board, a strong leadership team and great team members across our company focused on the right priorities, providing strong value propositions for our guests, leading to increased frequency and enhanced loyalty.","And with that, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open.","Brett Levy","Good morning, gentlemen. If you could do me a favor and talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, what you are seeing by the brands, where you are seeing the biggest impact either economically or from a competitive standpoint? And then just quick question on what do you think the possible peak margins are for Olive Garden, LongHorn and how do you get there? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Good morning, Brett. There is a lot in that question. Let me start off by just talking about the overall environment. I think that\u2019s what you really would like to hear us talk about this morning. The environment does remain competitive. We believe that the consumer is behaving very well in our restaurants. They continue to use the whole menu. We continue to see people buying \u2013 purchasing add-ons, both as appetizers, alcoholic beverages and desserts. We see people buying a little bit less on deal than they have in the past. However, we have done a good job as I mentioned in our prepared comments about anchoring our lunch and dinner menus with very attractive price points. The overall environment does feel a little bit promotional at this point in time and we are watching what everyone is doing. However, we think we are positioned well to continue to take market share. I just think the biggest move that we made in Olive Garden was putting that everyday value back on the menu. And we want a long time with our $9.99 price point at dinner. And I believe that \u2013 anchoring that menu with that price point has allowed us to use a lot of our promotional activity to deliver value in a different way and value can be delivered with the higher price points and the consumer has been very accepting of that. And I believe in Olive Garden, the overall experience has improved dramatically.","As far as overall peak margins, I really don\u2019t want to talk about a number that we want to put out there as what our peak margins are going to be. I mean I think there are so many variables that are inputs into that, what\u2019s the commodity environment? What\u2019s the pricing environment? We are going to continue to invest into the guest experience and do the things that we need to do to maintain and grow our market share and we will continue to focus on removing non-consumer facing costs from our business. And that\u2019s something we have been focused on for the last 18 months and we will continue to be focused on.","Brett Levy","Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird. Sir, your line is now open.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. Gene, my question is really on the outlook or the implied outlook for the fourth quarter. If I look at the comps guidance for the year, it does imply at least to the midpoint that your Q4 comps would be slightly below what you have been running in the past several quarters. And my question is, is that just conservatism on your part or is it related to comparisons or are you starting to see some signs of softness, I guess in the overall environment?","Gene Lee","Good morning, David. Our guidance is based on what we know today and what we believe the environment will provide us in the back half of the year. We believe it\u2019s the appropriate guidance with what we know today. The environment I would say continues to remain choppy. Week to week, as you look at Knapp Track and Black Box, continues to move around, trying to focus more on longer term trends than I am \u2013 what\u2019s happening week-to-week. We have got a shift in the Easter holiday that is I think going to make some of the week-to-week comparisons in the fourth quarter a little bit difficult to read. And I think \u2013 when I think about our guidance, I think \u2013 as we finish the year in the 3 to 3.5 range, I think that\u2019s a great year for Darden. And I think that\u2019s something we should be incredibly proud of.","David Tarantino","Great. And then one second question here, Gene could you maybe talk a little bit about what the initial reception to the catering effort has been and what you are seeing so far there and what you think the opportunity you would look out over the next 1 year or 2 years?","Gene Lee","Yes. We believe catering is a big opportunity. The reception has been fantastic. Again, it\u2019s been designed around this whole need space of convenience. We are able to bring this experience to you. We benefit significantly in Olive Garden because the food travel is so well, especially when we put it in these bulk containers. We are measuring closely intent to reorder and overall satisfaction. And the scores are really, really strong. The consumer is very, very happy with the product. It\u2019s unique and we believe that this is a huge opportunity over time, as we continue to build awareness. As we think about this, our consumer today has very, very low awareness of us doing this catering delivery. We have run some limited television advertising in some small markets to see what \u2013 how consumers react to that. And the reaction has been very positive. And so we will continue \u2013 our goal is to continue to find ways to build awareness of what we are doing.","David Tarantino","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we also have a question coming from the line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer. Sir, your line is now open.","Brian Bittner","Thanks. Thank you. Good morning Gene, Rick and Kevin. Question about the Olive Garden momentum that we saw in the quarter, we saw a pretty meaningful acceleration in the third quarter despite few other industry are remaining stuck in the same gear, that the go momentum is obviously very strong, but mathematically I don\u2019t think it could have driven that large of an acceleration, so what\u2019s really going on, in the third quarter to drive that large of an acceleration in the business, I know you guys with tablets in the assets before the quarter begin, does that have an impact, do you have any other color you can provide?","Gene Lee","Got it. Brian, I want to start at the level that \u2013 we are just running better restaurants today. And I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I don\u2019t think we should discount the importance of ensuring that we are properly staffed, our teams are properly motivated. Dave and his team have done an exceptional job of simplifying the operation by reducing the size of the menu and the processes and the procedures. I think the overall experience inside an Olive Garden today is significantly better than it was 12 months to 24 months ago. I think we are getting a lot of momentum from that. The tablets, obviously are helping as I have said in the last quarter, we are getting \u2013 we are closing out checks 7 minutes quicker than we have in the past. And so we are excited about some of the basic operations. And one of the things that we are focused on now is trying to keep things simple. And we talk a lot about simple is hard and doing simple things every single day is really, really hard. But that\u2019s what\u2019s giving us the biggest lift in Olive Garden. Our teams are doing a great job creating great dining experiences and we are not having to rely on promotional activity to drive the business. We are winning every single day at the 9 square feet. And I believe that\u2019s why we gained some momentum throughout the third quarter.","Brian Bittner","And just a follow-up question on \u2013 so far in the fourth quarter, I think it\u2019s no secret that the industry is pretty soft in March, what do you think is going on, what do you really attribute that to based on the seat that you sit in, what\u2019s going on with the consumer?","Gene Lee","Yes. I contribute them \u2013 the month \u2013 the week-to-week noise in March. And really, as I look at the industry, has more to do with Easter coming forward a couple of weeks than anything else.","Brian Bittner","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Sir, your line is now open.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. I have a question, but I have a follow-up on the previous question to go about the catering, I guess if you could talk about and look about some of the stores that do the best in either catering or OG to go, so I guess the ones that index higher than that 10.5% or so, how do they do on the other business, the in-store business, have they been out comping, I am curious if there is a halo effect as far as someone uses you on the go and does that strengthen the brand equity, are you seeing any incremental sales or is it cannibalistic to that existing business that was done in the store traditionally?","Gene Lee","Matt, one of the things that we are looking at is I think as I have said in the past, we are tokenizing credit cards. And so we are able to see if this consumer is using us for take out, is using us for in restaurant, too and we are seeing a lot of crossover. And so we are seeing people use both to go and in restaurant, which is exciting for us. We are also seeing consumers that just use us from a to go standpoint. When a restaurant has momentum, it\u2019s having \u2013 it\u2019s usually demonstrating momentum in all categories, so both takeout and in-restaurant. And so I think the root of your question is, there is a halo and one of the things that we think and we are trying to bear out in some research is takeout and OG to go is exposing Olive Garden to maybe some lapsed consumers. We are using it and then to say, hey that was pretty good, I am going to come back in and then try the restaurant. And so I think - basically I think what you are trying to get across in your question is true that we are getting some halo for the whole restaurant because of the to go experience.","Matthew DiFrisco","Great. And then I just want to clarify your detail of Texas, I think you called it out for how it\u2019s affected any reason, I am curious, that was the higher end, but have you seen any other distinguishing trends in Texas or weaker trends in Texas below sort of the any of these price point in the fine dining category, is it impaired or have you seen it \u2013 be economy down there, way over something like a LongHorn or in Olive Garden?","Gene Lee","No. We have seen nothing in casual dining that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s still Texas is still performing fairly well and Houston is performing fairly well. I called it out any of these because when you look at that footprint, I think Texas is about 40% of the total footprint. And so it\u2019s a little bit \u2013 it\u2019s really easy to see there, especially in Houston. We have two restaurants in Houston that have been significantly impacted.","Matthew DiFrisco","So that\u2019s just to read then I guess on the higher end as far as related to the energy business is getting curtailed, roughly\u2026?","Gene Lee","Yes. I think it\u2019s a large party, the celebratory. We need to work hard in luxury dining to make sure that we find other people or other businesses that are doing well and make sure that we invite them in and use our facilities.","Matthew DiFrisco","Understood. I appreciate the detail. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we also have a question coming from the line of Billy Sherrill from Stephens Incorporated. You may begin.","Billy Sherrill","Hi. Thanks, guys. Congrats on a good quarter and thank you for taking my question. So last quarter you guys touched on the tightening labor market conditions, you were saying and I was hoping to get a little more visibility and how you guys are navigating that environment, I guess particularly with respect to demand or turnover and whether or not you are having to I guess plan to take any additional steps to retain some of that talent?","Gene Lee","Yes. The wage environment is definitely continuing to evolve. I would say that turnover in the industry is up. Our gap to the industry continues to improve, but our turnover is up. And I would talk about that as I think the restaurant employee is a little bit more mobile today. I think that there is people who were working in our industry because there are \u2013 other alternatives weren\u2019t available to them, I think those other alternatives today are starting to become available. It\u2019s going to put a little bit of pressure on wage rate as the industry competes for the best talent to run their businesses. I think at Darden, we have a compelling employment proposition and I think that we are \u2013 when I think about it, we are at an advantage here. The other thing to point out is when you look at Darden\u2019s footprint we have a great footprint and operate a lot of restaurants and markets where we still have federal minimum wage in those states and that\u2019s \u2013 that really offsets some of the other mandated wage increases that are happening in some of the other states. And I would conclude by just stating that at Darden, we have industry leading retention. We have some of the best retention and low turnover rates in all of full-service dining. So again, we are positioned well to deal with this. I would like to say that historically operating in an environment where you have a little bit of wage inflation at \u2013 with your staff has been good for sales long-term. And I would much rather operate in this environment than in an environment where the industry was maybe struggling a little bit more from a top line standpoint than we had plenty of help.","Billy Sherrill","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And just one quick follow-up if I could. I believe, you also said that last quarter, you had thought that you might have trouble pushing more price in the near term given the current environment. So, I was wondering \u2013 I am assuming that there is not anymore additional pricing implied for the back \u2013 for the last quarter of the year, but do you have an idea of when you will be able to push some more price particularly at Olive Garden?","Gene Lee","Well, I think we will continue to look at what pricing is available to us. In Olive Garden, we are trying to holdback our pricing, to improve the value proposition for the consumer and so we are looking for other ways to improve margins other than through pricing so that we can continue to create a compelling value. This is where I think it\u2019s important that we focus on using our scale to our advantage. If we can use our scale to our advantage, price less than our competitive set, our value \u2013 perceived value with the consumer should go up and that\u2019s what our strategic plan is right now, use our scale, don\u2019t rely on pricing to create value and let\u2019s win market share.","Billy Sherrill","Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful and congrats again guys.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question coming from the line of Joseph Buckley of Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open.","Joseph Buckley","Thank you. First, just another question on sales, can you say what the To Go catering influence was on the third quarter same-store sales? And then is there a difference in pricing between what you realized in the third quarter and the price effect you are assuming in the fourth quarter and your full year guidance?","Gene Lee","As far as takeout, takeout was 35% of the overall comp and of that delivery was 25% of that growth. So, takeout is playing a big part, but in this quarter, it wasn\u2019t the whole thing. So very, very good growth in restaurant takeout and then we should look for catering and delivery to continue to ramp up over time as we build awareness. As we think about the fourth quarter, we don\u2019t have any additional pricing schedule to go in. We are going to continue to try to create value by not pricing, our pricing a lot less than we historically would have.","Joseph Buckley","Can I ask where on the expansion also? Rick, you gave us the range of potential openings for 2017, could you update us what you are thinking the full year numbers will look for \u201816 and for the \u201817 numbers, what brands will get the lion\u2019s share of that? And is that a gross number also?","Rick Cardenas","Hey, Joe. Yes, for \u201816, we still expect to open around 18 to 22 new units that is not a net number, that\u2019s a gross number. And for \u201817, the numbers I talked to you about, 24 to 28, is also gross and we will give you more insight on to what brands are going to have some of that growth next year in our June call.","Joseph Buckley","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is now open.","Jeff Farmer","Great, thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on the table turn topic I think a 7 minute or 10% reduction in average table turn time in Olive Garden, that\u2019s a pretty big number. So, if the concept is capacity constrained for 15%, even 20% of transactions, that 10% reduction in table turn time would be a pretty sizable traffic driver. So, is it a fair way to think about it like that?","Gene Lee","Jeff, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think your logic is correct. However, what we are measuring is the time the check opens and the time the check closes. That doesn\u2019t mean that consumer leaves, just because they had the ability to close that check out quicker. Internally, we are making the assumption that the guest after they closed out their check with a credit card and doing it in the historical way, on average, was hanging around the same amount of time after they paid the check as the consumer who is closing out on Ziosk is hanging around. And so if we make those two assumptions then that 7 minutes is meaningful. But if \u2013 we have no way of knowing if the guest is closing out the check with the Ziosk and then staying around the few extra minutes and we are not really getting that full 7 minutes.","Jeff Farmer","Okay. Then let me ask the question just a little different way. I think your Olive Garden\u2019s year-to-date traffic up about 1.5%, big number, especially relative to the peers. What would some of the key drivers of that be?","Gene Lee","Yes. The key drivers is \u2013 I am going to go back to \u2013 we are running better restaurants today. We are better staffed. Our processes and procedures are simpler. Our restaurant managers are more focused and feel an ownership of having the responsibility to drive sales. Their compensation aligns with them driving same restaurant sales. And so I think those are key drivers. I do think there is other things that we have done along the way. Ziosk is one of them that\u2019s helped out and so on and so forth. So, I got to \u2013 I want to keep going back to we are running better restaurants today, we are winning at the 9 square feet and we are creating the loyalty of these people, we are exceeding the guest expectation. We are focused and we are executing and we still have room to improve.","Jeff Farmer","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question coming from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning. Gene, I think investors are wrestling with the fact that Darden puts its stake in casual dining in that segment over the long-term and I guess it\u2019s gotten worse lately. It\u2019s showing same-store sales or in particular same-store traffic declines. Our industry participants out there not executing like Darden, perhaps they are not reinvesting in food and labor like you and perhaps they are not even representing the segment versus fast food, which is doing much better than casual dining lately. Will we see some other segment relevance issues and perhaps tying into that you get customer satisfaction survey data that we don\u2019t see perhaps that gives you a signal as to what\u2019s going on in terms of the competitive differentiation? Thanks.","Gene Lee","Yes. Good morning, David. I don\u2019t want to get \u2013 comment on what our competitors are doing. I will say that we are \u2013 there are others in casual dining that are winning, that continue to outperform the industry and significantly outperform the industry with strong value equations and relevant brands. We continue to believe that if we invest in the guest and we provide an experience and provide value to the guest on multiple dimensions, we will continue to grow our market share. We do have access to research. We like the trends that we are seeing with our brands and it tells us the consumer is seeing what we are doing, but it does start with the basics of having a great host or hostess at the front door, inviting guests in. It starts with having service staff that\u2019s appropriately \u2013 has the appropriate size section. They have derived small ways and the tools that do their jobs. And we have a simplified process in the kitchen where our chefs and cooks can prepare the food properly. And I believe all the little details that we are doing is giving \u2013 is allowing us to create this deal market share at this point in time.","David Palmer","So the food, the labor scores, I mean what are the major \u2013 if you had to pinpoint the scores that people where really are \u2013 if they are getting the joke about your brands and the fact that Olive Garden and you are outperforming what others too, is it mostly the food and mostly the labor, what is this?","Gene Lee","It\u2019s \u2013 David, it\u2019s all and when we talk about food service and atmosphere as our key operating philosophy here, we are winning on food, we are winning on service, we are winning on atmosphere and that all equals value. And value, I think value today in our industry is much more than just a price point. And so when we talk with management teams and the presidents here about what they are doing, we are trying to deliver value on multiple dimensions. Now you have to have value on with a price point for certain guests. But other guests on that dimension are looking for value that we deliver in different ways. And I think we are doing a really good job of doing that. But we can\u2019t rest. We have to continue to evolve and continue to look for different ways to deliver value because everything we can do in this industry can be replicated except for the operational part. The operational part is really hard and I will go back to something I have said earlier in a response to the question is, we are focused on doing simple things and simple things \u2013 doing simple things is really hard.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jason West of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is now open.","Jason West","Yes. Thanks guys. Just a couple of questions, one Gene, if you could talk about sort of your broader philosophy here around advertising, I know we have tried to dial back some of the monthly promotions that the brand used to rely on, but also just a broader kind of TV spending, Darden and Olive Garden have always been very heavy in that category, do you see that type of spin winding down or not winding down, but sort of moderating over time as you run better restaurants and you need to rely less on that type of spending?And then I had a follow-up on CapEx. Thanks.","Gene Lee","Alright. Jason, TV for Olive Garden is still the best medium for us to spend our money. We can see sales move week-to-week based on how many TRPs we are spending. And so we are transitioning some dollars from TV over to digital and other \u2013 and social and some other things. But TV is always going to play a big part of the Olive Garden story until something dramatic changes with the consumer. Our target audience is still fairly easy to reach through television. And one of the things that we have done a lot better in the last 24 months is really hone in on that target and spend against that target appropriately. And so, Dave and the team have done a great job of ensuring every dollar we invest is moving forward. Where we are making meaningful progress on advertising spending is in LongHorn, where I believe we became very inefficient over time and trying to act like a bigger brand than we really were. And so we have been able to save significant dollars in that budget as we move to spot television and supporting our restaurants that aren\u2019t media efficient with other means of support. And that\u2019s been investment very effective for us and we will continue to do that.","Jason West","Thank you. And on the CapEx, Rick can you talk a bit about the plan at Olive Garden, I think you are talking about 60 remodels there for fiscal \u201817, I think you guys had done some tests around 30 units this year, is that sort of the type of run rate that you are looking at for the next few years or do you expect that number to ramp more aggressively over time. And how many of the Olive Garden units do you think need a full remodel, is it still that sort of half the base, sort of number that we are thinking about?","Rick Cardenas","Yes. Jason, in regards to remodels for next year, the 60 number is what we expect to be doing next year. We are getting great returns on those remodels. We also anticipate continuing to invest in our restaurants, including remodels the year \u2013 in future years. But as I have mentioned in my prepared remarks, we also invest over 60 \u2013 around $60,000 a year per restaurant to make sure that our restaurants continue to look fresh. The 35 that we have done have \u2013 as I said have done great for us. We expect to continue that result and we will continue to remodel as we find the right restaurants to remodel. But one thing I will say is in the past, remodels were one-size-fits-all. And we believe that we need to look at every restaurant individually to ensure that we spend the right amount of money in each restaurant. And think of the remodel is more of an evolution versus a revolution. So we don\u2019t think we have to do all 200 to 300 of them at one time.","Jason West","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. I am just looking back over the past 18 months obviously it\u2019s been an impressive turn of the fundamentals, I think we agree on both the comp and the cost savings side, as we now think is kind of the next 18 months, just getting a lot of questions on the sustainability of that performance, obviously it\u2019s hard for you to forecast the comp side, maybe you can offer some more color on the cost side, which I know you have been saying kind of the long-term run rate was now in the $150 million plus range and whether you are now start to consider some of the other big suggestions that came out 18 months ago, whether there is any thought of separating or monetizing some of the Specialty Restaurant Group and\/or are more potential around any kind of franchising or what not, just your thoughts on those potential opportunities? And then I had one follow-up.","Gene Lee","Hi. Good morning, Jeff. We are proud of the work we have done over the past 18 months. We have really made some good improvement. We have done that through focusing on some basics, as I have talked about. The management and the Board will continue to evaluate all the alternatives for the business over time. We have laid out our long-term strategic framework. We believe the portfolio we have today is a great portfolio to achieve that. We have also laid our strategic initiatives, which revolve a lot around scale. And we have laid out and we laid it out in the presentation \u2013 in our investor presentation how that scale is really benefiting us from a G&A standpoint. And so as we look at what we are doing with the portfolio right now and our strategy, we believe moving forward with what we are doing in the past that we are on is the right path. As far as sustainability of the path that we are on, I will go back to a couple of things. I will go back to continuing to use scale. We are in the infancy of really taking advantage of our data and insights. I think that we are doing a lot of that today. I can\u2019t talk too much about it because it is a competitive advantage for us. And I also think that we are doing some really great things from a strategic planning standpoint that are giving us an advantage in the marketplace. We will continue to stay focused on running great restaurants. I believe that\u2019s the key differentiator at the end of the day. This is getting to be $100 billion category, although we would like to see it grow faster than it\u2019s growing. There is still a lot of market share available to be taken, if we continue to outperform and out execute the competitive set. And that\u2019s what we are focused on. And we have \u2013 again, as far as momentum, we have kind of laid out with the long-term strategic framework, what we think this business is capable of and we believe providing our shareholders a 10% to 15% total shareholder return is a compelling investment in today\u2019s environment.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Agreed. And then just to your point you mentioned earlier about the categories heading towards $100 billion and obviously you would like it to be a little healthier, but I am just wondering, when you get asked why maybe you are not seeing stronger trends across all of casual dining, if the consumer confidence and employment are positive and gas prices are favorable, I am just \u2013 when you size up what you think the greatest industry headwinds are, the greatest concerns, is it capacity or is I guess just lost value or maybe fast casual intrusion, just what\u2019s holding back the category from what would have \u2013 we would have expected to be further improvement in trend based on the historical correlations in some of those key metrics?","Gene Lee","Yes. I think there are two things out there. I think there is capacity. There is a lot of capacity out there too. I think there is a lack of really good innovative new ideas that get consumers excited about what we are doing. I think that\u2019s the biggest headwind.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question coming from the line of Keith Siegner of UBS. Sir, your line is now open.","Dennis Geiger","This is Dennis Geiger on for Keith and thanks for the question. So, just to build a little bit more on the competitive environment theme. Anything that you would call out as it relates to where you are seeing the most impact from competition, whether it\u2019s the dinner or the lunch day part? And then for Olive Garden, are the $6.99 and $9.99 lunch and dinner price point offerings, in your view the key drivers that\u2019s better helping you to win on value or is it much more a combination of things? And if the former, can we see the continued evolution of similar value offerings going forward?","Gene Lee","Let me start with the second question first. I do think anchoring your menus with everyday value is important, so the consumer knows that they can come to your restaurant, not have to rely on being told what they have to eat from a promotional standpoint to get that value or use a coupon to get that value. And Olive Garden has always been the value leader. And so I think that\u2019s really important for them. What was the \u2013 can you just tell me what the first question was again?","Dennis Geiger","Sure. Just as it relates to value, if you could call out where you are seeing it \u2013 I am sorry, competition, where you are seeing it more whether it\u2019s the lunch or the dinner day parts, any kind of commentary there?","Gene Lee","Yes. I mean, all day parts we are seeing incredible competitive pressure. I will say that I think the lunch day part for casual dining has a lot more competition, because I think fast casual is a much more bigger option at lunch. I also think good \u2013 great quick-serve restaurants provide competitive competition at lunch. And so when quick-serve gets stronger and gets in the value of becoming much better that puts a little bit more pressure on lunch.","Dennis Geiger","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.","John Glass","Thanks very much. On LongHorn, you talked a little bit about pulling back on price promotion and maybe that was the reason why traffic was softer than prior quarters. Is this part of the evolution that you are doing in the brand similar to Olive Garden where you are going to focus more in these anchor price points? Are you doing that at risk or peril of, since the commodity is down, your competitors are going to be more price promotional on steak, maybe you can talk about if you have actually seen that and if that\u2019s a real risk there?","Gene Lee","John, when we think about the positioning for LongHorn. We see that the target consumer there is a lot different than the target consumer at Olive Garden. And I think historically \u2013 in the last couple of years, we have drifted the target in LongHorn down to a consumer that is more trying to be more like an Olive Garden consumer. And I think that we have done a lot of price points at 2 for $29, $12 steaks. I believe LongHorn is a bit of more of a premium offer and we need to focus on that. So right now, we are out there doing our 18 ounce bone-in ribeye and we are off there promoting a 10-ounce fillet, which is the first time in 6, 7 years we have been out there with a 10-ounce fillet. And consumer satisfaction is improving dramatically. At the end of the day, what we are doing in LongHorn today is we are removing some consumers, some guest from the guest base that we are confident that we weren\u2019t making any money on. And they were a consumer that was spending \u2013 buying a low-end steak, coming in with a $5 coupon and that was all happening while we had a 45-minute wait outside the restaurant, waiting \u2013 people waiting to get into pay full price for more of a higher end experience in casual dining steak. And so we believe that we are transitioning the positioning slightly and we believe this is the right place to be. It\u2019s a place that I am personally a lot more comfortable with LongHorn and where LongHorn should be. We are going to invest in quality. We are going to invest in staffing. And most importantly, we are going to invest \u2013 we are going to continue to simplify the LongHorn operation has become too complex over time.","John Glass","Great. And Rick, if I could just follow-up on your comments on \u201817, first, just with respect to CapEx, is this kind of a steady state going up, I don\u2019t know, 30%, 40% next year, but is this kind of the new steady-state in terms of unit openings you would expect for the next couple of years? I think you commented about remodels, but is this a good way to think about the capital spending in the business in aggregate? And then, is 2017 also an opportunity to look at the balance sheet? How active a conversation is looking at the balance sheet, now that you have got a real estate behind you and the business is in a much stronger footing, is that potentially a 2,000 event \u2013 re-leverage event?","Rick Cardenas","Thanks, John. The 2017 CapEx that we mentioned in the new units, I would refer you to the long-term framework that we have for new units of 2% to 3%. The amounts that we gave you there are slightly below the long-term framework on new units, but we expect to be at the long-term framework over time. And can you give me the \u2013 remind me the second part of the question, sorry?","John Glass","Your balance sheet\u2026.","Rick Cardenas","The balance sheet, we continually work with our board to regularly evaluate the alternatives that we have with the cash on hand to achieve our financial goals and \u2013 but our first priority is to maintain the investment grade profile.","John Glass","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question coming from the line of Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Ma\u2019am, your line is now open.","Karen Holthouse","Yes. Another question on catering, I am curious if you have any idea of the breakdown for how much of that is B2B versus going towards a consumer? And then within what I think a pretty fragmented sort of large order catering market, do you have a sense of who you might be taking share from? Thanks.","Gene Lee","Yes. Karen, it\u2019s primarily B2B at this point in time. However, we are seeing some growth in residential. We have done weddings. We are heading into graduation season. And so again, I get back to the point I made earlier. This is about building awareness, because every time we do an event, we are \u2013 the intent to reorder is extremely high and the satisfaction is extremely high. Right now is a natural for B2B, but we do believe we can grow it into more of a residential, large home meal replacement opportunity.","Karen Holthouse","Great, thank you. And then one quick housekeeping if I can squeeze it in. Last year, the fourth quarter ended a week after Memorial Day and this year it looks like it ends on Memorial Day weekend. Is there any sort of \u2013 would you expect that sort of that first week of summer index to a higher \u2013 lower sales week that we should be thinking about?","Rick Cardenas","Yes. I would say, Karen, for the fourth quarter you would probably expect the first week to be a little lower because of the Memorial Day weekend.","Karen Holthouse","Great, thank you.","Rick Cardenas","The last week. I am sorry, the last week.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question coming from the line of Andy Barish of Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open.","Andy Barish","Thanks, guys. The LongHorn margin stepped up significantly in the quarter to 20%. I know you talked about some of the promotional changes. Are we at a sort of a new level here? I mean, it was a pretty rapid step up or maybe how much of it was beef versus some timing or marketing shifts, just trying to gauge what went on with the margins at LongHorn?","Gene Lee","Yes. Part of \u2013 first of all, third quarter in LongHorn is by far the best quarter and so that model really starts to work when you get into $67,000, $68,000 a week for average weekly sales. Beef was very little of it. We haven\u2019t started to see that really flow through. Some of it was as I have talked about was the marketing. We have got every single line item continued to improve and it was a lot of individual, 10 basis points here, 20 basis points there that added up to the 400 basis points with the big savings coming in labor. And so again, it gets to that whole idea of when we get LongHorn to $67,000, $68,000 a week this model really works.","Andy Barish","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question from David Carlson of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open.","David Carlson","Thank you, guys for taking my call. Gene has the increased To Go volume created any operational issues for the restaurants and do you believe the restaurants are well-positioned to handle greater volume following the receivables advertising support? And I have a follow-up.","Gene Lee","Yes, David. One of the things that the Olive Garden team did was before we really started to push takeout is they went back and they looked at every process and procedure and ensured that they were able to handle the increase in volume. And therefore this has been really, really well-thought out. The beauty of the catering delivery is it\u2019s \u2013 we ask for 24 hour advance notice. And we are actually able to increase our productivity, because we are able to plan ahead and we are able to use some of our downside \u2013 downtime in our cycles to help prepare for the catering delivery. So, that\u2019s really been a real enhancement from a productivity standpoint. We believe that we can continue to handle the increase in volume, especially if it comes in catering delivery, because that usually goes out our door before lunch or before dinner, which is ideal. So, growth in that business really, really increases our overall productivity.","David Carlson","Well, that makes sense. And then my follow-up was now that you guys have the digital ordering for To Go, have you noticed much more of a much larger ticket from the online orders versus the old phone-based ordering system?","Gene Lee","Yes, the online ordering is still \u2013 I think it\u2019s still 20% higher than calling in on the phone. We are incentivizing people to switch over to online ordering. Just the overall process, when you think about it, when you are on the phone, we are trying to do the best job we can at the restaurant, but sometimes that person taking the order behind the counter or behind the bar has got a guest in front of them. And so, they are \u2013 one of the things they are trying to do is get the order as fast as they can and get them off the phone, where if you are online, we can push you through a process and do a much better job selling to you. And we find the consumer online is much more happy to buyout. And so we are trying to incentivize as much business to switch over to online ordering. And we also just put out \u2013 the Olive Garden just put out its new app this week. So hopefully, that will continue to help, that will help migrate people over to online ordering.","David Carlson","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question from Steve Anderson of Maxim Group. Sir, your line is now open.","Steve Anderson","Very good. I just have a couple of questions on your cost reduction goals as well as on food cost. First, on the cost reduction side, I know you gave guidance back in December on the food \u2013 rather on your cost reduction goals. I just want to see, I may have missed this, is if you could provide an update on this call as well as any update on your food cost \u2013 outlook on food costs, is that changed?","Gene Lee","Sure, Steve. We still expect our total cumulative savings to be between $145 million to $165 million over fiscal \u201815 through fiscal \u201817. And I just want to remind you that we are leveraging our scale and simplifying our business in ways that don\u2019t impact the consumer. We expect $80 million to $90 million of those cost savings to come in this year. In answer to your question about inflation and commodities, we expect and what we have in our web presentation in the appendix is we expect low single-digit deflation in commodities in the fourth quarter. But overall inflation for the year is still expected \u2013 expected to be 1% to 1.5%. That\u2019s slightly favorable to the amounts that we gave you in the second quarter. So, again, overall inflation, 1% to 1.5%, but low single-digit deflation in food and beverage in the fourth quarter.","Steve Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have Andrew Strelzik for the question and answer from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open.","Andrew Strelzik","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two things. First, clearly, the comps momentum is strong, but if you look at it on a 2-year basis in February, the traffic did slow a little bit. Is there anything maybe one-time in nature that might have impacted that or do you not look at it that way? And secondarily, just looking at capital allocation for 2017, obviously the step up in CapEx, I am wondering if the long-term $100 million to $200 million share repo is in play for 2017 or should we expect something maybe lower than that with the step up in the CapEx?","Gene Lee","Yes. Let me answer first the CapEx question and I will go back to the same restaurant sales. The $100 million to $200 million that we have in our long term framework is that it\u2019s our long-term framework. We will tell you a little bit more about \u201817 in \u201817, but I would expect it to be somewhere in there. But it won\u2019t be \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be impacted by the increasing CapEx, I can tell you that. On the same restaurant sales, our 2-year same restaurant sales in February, trying to get to that number for you real quick is about 5.7%, so still a strong 2-year stack. It wasn\u2019t as big as January, I believe, but still 5.7% over 2 years is strong performance and we feel good about that.","Andrew Strelzik","So, certainly the overall comp, I wouldn\u2019t disagree with your comment. I was looking more at the traffic, but maybe we will take the question offline. Thanks a lot.","Gene Lee","That will be great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open.","John Ivankoe","Short one for me, when you guys look at where the beef spot markets are and where the beef futures markets are on the terms of live and feeder cattle and maybe the price of corn. I mean, how does that give you feeling about in terms of what you think your commodity basket could potentially be for \u201817? In other words, relative to what you paid in \u201816, how good of an environment could we potentially be in?","Gene Lee","John, we will comment on the full commodities breadbasket in the call in June for \u201817. But let me just \u2013 I will just give you my thoughts on the beef market as I am pretty close to it. The futures market looks very positive as we move forward. We at Darden have been short through this last cycle and we expect it to be a tailwind as we move into next year. I will say and I think it\u2019s important for everybody to know this, is that the middle meats continue to be strong. And we have seen a lot of relief in ground beef, but we have not seen a lot of relief in the middle meats, your tenderloins, your short loins and your ribs. And so I believe that beef in \u201817 will be less than it was in \u201816, but I also believe beef is still going to be historically expensive.","John Ivankoe","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, we don\u2019t have any question on queue.","Kevin Kalicak","Alright. Thank you, Hans. That concludes our call. I want to remind you all that we expect to release our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year results on Thursday, June 30 before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you all for your participation in today\u2019s call and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you and that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

We released fourth quarter earnings results this morning. These results were available on PR Newswire and other wire services. We have a slide to our presentation that you should be able to access through the webcast link at darden.com or videonewswire.com. After the presentation we will take you questions until approximately 9:30 Eastern Time.","With that, let me turn it over to Clarence.","[Author ID1: at Mon Jun 23 16:50:00 2014"," ]","Clarence Otis","Thank you, Matthew and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2014 was clearly obviously a year of significant transformation for us. And so we had a number of changes that complicate our financial reporting and we appreciate this opportunity to walk you through the numbers in some detail. The transformation also had many other very important dimensions and we appreciate the opportunity to discuss those with you as well.","Ultimately, all the change that took place is done to do one thing and that\u2019s to better position us to create significant shareholder value. And so this year was one that was highlighted by a number of things, certainly the launch of a comprehensive brand renaissance plan to regain momentum at Olive Garden. It\u2019s highlighted by continued success at LongHorn Steakhouse where same restaurant sales exceeded the industry by nearly four percentage points and at our specialty restaurant group which has grown to $1.2 billion in sales.","The year was also highlighted by the announcement of the sale of Red Lobster for $2.1 billion and our announcement in undertaking of significant cost restructuring. Cost restructuring which means that G&A as a percent of sales is expected to remain approximately 5% and that\u2019s because the cost savings achieved with assistance of Alvarez and Marsal more than offset by roughly $40 million, potential stranded costs related to the sale of Red Lobster that cost restructuring also means that in fiscal 2015 SG&A as a percent of sales is expected to be the lowest, since we became a public company in 1995.","The year also included continued industry-leading return to capital and that return totals $1.2 billion now in the past three years. We distributed $288 million in dividends to shareholders and we recently announced an additional $500 million to $600 million of share repurchase for fiscal 2015 for a total share repurchase program for next year or this year that just started up to $700 million. In addition we strengthened our credit profile with our plans to retire approximately $1 billion of our existing debt and we made some refinements in our management compensation incentive programs to more directly emphasize same restaurant sales and free cash flow growth.","And Brad is going to discuss our sales and earnings results both with and without Red Lobster, so Brad?","","Bradford Richmond","Thank you Clarence and good morning everybody. On this slide I\u2019ll be brief as a lot of its covered in our press release that went out this morning, but I would point out that combined sales reached $8.758 billion, that\u2019s up 2.4% to the prior year. I think more importantly is when you look at continuing operation sales, and that\u2019s excluding Red Lobster and the Red Lobster\u2019s consumer packaged goods products and international fees and royalties, sales were $6.286 billion, or up 6.2%; a significantly higher growth rate than the combined company enjoys.","Now our brands are making strong progress or maintaining high levels of performance in the new fiscal year. And so we will touch more about the activities and initiatives that are driving that, but if you look over at the far right-hand column, you see same restaurant sales for the first three weeks of our new fiscal year. The brand renaissance at Olive Garden is clearly taking hold as you see improvement in their trend. Their same restaurant sales are flat which is above the Knapp-Track industry benchmark, and you see continued strong performance from LongHorn Steakhouse and the specialty restaurants. ","Now, turning to next page, and talking about our earnings performance and how that\u2019s reported. Unfortunately, GAAP reporting is not always as intuitive as we'd like for it to be and that is the case with the separation of Red Lobster. So, on this slide I'll walk us through the geography of reported earnings to what we call performance view of our results; and if you start with reported combined fully diluted EPS, that\u2019s $2.15 for fiscal 2014. Now, in that number, we have the strategic action plan costs, and that\u2019s really to execute our plan that involves the real estate work, legal work, advisory fees, retention bonuses, and all of those costs, along with some related impairments to implement that plan.","You'd have to add those back for $0.27. There's also some other impairment charges that we incurred to exit our restaurant lease in the future but before the original lease term expires and there is also some charges as we move forward with the new Olive Garden new model designs and previous charges that we needed to write-off. And that\u2019s a $0.05 charge. So, you need to add those two items back to get a performance view of Darden on a combined basis. And this is how we've been talking to you previously in terms of our guidance and expectations. So $2.47 earnings per share is that number.","Now, with the announcement of the Red Lobster sales, all presented Red Lobster results for current and prior periods are moved to discontinued operations, but not all of the cost move when you make that type of reporting adjustment. So if you start again with reported fully diluted earnings per share of $2.15, to that you would exclude Red Lobster\u2019s results of operations which are $0.91 in fiscal 2014 you\u2019d add back strategic action plan cost and the related impairment charges that are within discontinued operations, that\u2019s $0.14. And so when you combine these, this results in a continuing operations reported number of $1.38.","Now, to move from that reported continuing operations number to how have we performed, you have to add back shared support cost. In Darden we use a very extensive shared service platform for a number of our support services, but in the reporting those shared cost cannot be moved to discontinued operations. Now, after the sale obviously those costs will go away and be moved to Red Lobster, but for reporting purposes currently they aren\u2019t. And that represents $0.15 of impact that we've identified that it\u2019s virtually all headcount related and so we have a high certainty that those costs will move once the separation is effective.","The remainder of the $0.27 in strategic action plan costs that are not included in discontinued operations, we add those back, that\u2019s $0.13. And there is other impairment charges that I mentioned earlier for lease exit and remodel cost at Olive Garden at $0.05. So when you combine those with a reported $1.38 from continuing operations, we get $1.71 of continuing operations performance view if you will, EPS; or down 11.4% to the prior year. ","I know this is a little confusing at first, but it starts -- always start with reported results first and then for total operations and then we go to discontinuing operations, continued operations, so you can get a view of our true performance. ","We'll come back to this approach as we build our detail, our expectations for fiscal 2015, that we felt that was helpful to lay this out with the full detail so you can better understand our performance. Clarence?","Clarence Otis ","Thank you, Brad. To frame our discussion about our strategic action plan and our outlook for fiscal 2015, we thought it made sense to provide some context, and that context in a sentence is that we\u2019re in a more mature yet more dynamic industry. Now that said, as industry growth slows with maturity, we believe there are attractive consumer segments and we think we've created a portfolio that\u2019s well positioned to succeed against those consumer segments going forward.","So we think about the industry\u2019s maturation. There are a number of things that are driving that. Certainly slower growth in the (Bloomberg) [ph] population, aged 50 to 60 and that\u2019s where dining out frequency is the highest, has always been the highest, slower growth in household income overall, increased competition, not only within full-service dining but also with the emergence of attractive new segments, new dining segments like fast-casual and elevated innovation within traditional quick service. ","As all that happens, some important demographic and economic dynamics and where the share growth opportunity is, and that is a significant increase in millennials, significant increase in multicultural households across all age and household income spectrums, there\u2019s increased spending power in generation X, and overarching dynamic, is that there is increased digital interconnectedness across all generations in all other demographics. ","Now, as we look at these dynamics, in order to create value we got some very clear priorities. And those priorities are for value creation, really are to separate Red Lobster (through the) [ph] sale, because we don\u2019t believe that Red Lobster is well-positioned as our other brands for the future that we see. And we sold Red Lobster, again for $2.1 billion to Goldengate Capital, and we're on track to close that sale in July. Execute the Olive Garden brand renaissance. ","Gene is going to provide some more detail, but that\u2019s all about improved food, improved service, a stronger communications platform, continue to develop LongHorn into America\u2019s favorite Steakhouse. And LongHorn, as we've said; very successful, both with new restaurant expansion and with same restaurant sales growth; to grow our specialty restaurant sales by more than $1 billion is our target over the next five years and we\u2019re on track based on the performance in \u201914 and our outlook for \u201915. To do that, further optimize operating support and direct operating cost. ","We've done a lot. We'll talk in detail about that. We've described some of it already. And then better align our management compensation systems to reflect a new reality and the new drivers really of value creation. And I'll get into more detail about that later. And then to make sure that we\u2019ve got appropriate capital allocation discipline. And certainly we believe that the reduced new unit growth that we've got going forward to commitment to hold acquisitions is consistent with that.","Let me begin the more detailed discussion of these priorities by reviewing the Red Lobster sale. The net sale was a result of a very robust process that maximized value and minimized risk; total consideration $2.1 billion in cash, that represents a purchase multiple of nine times trailing 12 months EBITDA as of April. That process involved 70 financial and strategic buyers and another 25 real estate buyers. With the sale we expect our investment grade credit profile to remain intact indeed to improve somewhat; we expect to maintain our $2.20 per share annual dividend; the sale will be accretive to Darden\u2019s long term earnings growth rate, so we expect to have not only a higher earnings growth rate but higher sales growth rate and higher margins. With the sale we\u2019ll have less volatility in our quarterly sales and earnings, so sale that was unanimously approved by our Board and the $2.1 billion sale price is a premium multiple compared to comparable restaurant deals and we\u2019re able to secure that despite the fact that Red Lobster has some meaningfully declining operating trends and you can see that from a same restaurant sales perspective and an EBITDA perspective in the two charts at the bottom of this slide.","With the sale we achieved the objectives that we previously communicated, those objectives are listed here, so I won\u2019t go through all of them in the interest of time. But as we look at Darden post sale, there are a number of things that are different. So Darden post sale is a leading multi-brand operator, again higher more consistent sales and earnings growth driven by stronger overall positioning with these consumer segments that are attractive given where the industry is and where it\u2019s headed and given its restaurant expansion footprint. ","We\u2019re an operator with a commitment to quality and menu innovation and that also carries with it a more balanced commodity purchasing profile. We have a commitment to return the capital so stronger free cash flow again due to the reduced capital expenditures and that supports strong dividend and allows for increased share repurchase. We have stable and growing cash flow with reduced again quarterly sales and earnings volatility and as I said, a better credit profile. ","And then finally we have an experienced and quality management team and that team with certain refinements in our management incentive program has an even sharper focus on same restaurant sales and free cash flow growth.","Now drilling down, this next chart shows just how much better positioned for growth Darden is post the Red Lobster sale. It shows our cumulative total sales growth from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2014 overall at 23%. And then if you exclude Red Lobster that cumulative number is 40%, it also shows the CAGRs and the CAGR excluding Red Lobster for that period is 2.5 points higher than it is including Red Lobster. Beyond the Red Lobster sale, a key component of our strategic action plan is of course regaining momentum at Olive Garden and Gene\u2019s going to update you on that, so Gene.","Gene Lee","Good morning. I\u2019ll spend the majority of my time this morning talking about Olive Garden and then quickly discuss LongHorn and our Specialty Restaurants. Olive Garden provides a strong foundation for the overall Darden business. It\u2019s a premier brand in casual dining with average restaurant volumes of 4.4 million and industry leading returns. We are confident that the recently launched brand Renaissance plan is addressing erosion and visit frequency among our core guests. This plan also will enhance our solid position with millennial and multicultural households and is the platform for renewed same restaurant sales growth and margin expansion.","While many of the elements have been underdevelopment during the past year, we\u2019re in the early stages of exposing guests to what we call our brand Renaissance plan. Our objective is to make certain that our guest enjoy differentiate experience of today\u2019s Italy where Olive Garden\u2019s warm hospitality and superior value bring people together. ","In terms of food, quality, not surprisingly, is what guests want most. And freshness drives quality more than any other attribute. So we are emphasizing food prepared with the freshest ingredients presented simply with a sense of flair as very Italian. Our efforts are focused on making our service approachable and genuine, so guests can focus on sharing great food and conversation which is why they come to Olive Garden. Within our restaurants we want to make certain that our atmosphere is natural, clean and tasteful while its tone is warm, relaxed and engaging. At every turn we are looking to reinforce these aspects of the atmosphere within our restaurants.","Lastly, although Olive Garden has a national presence of more than 800 restaurants, we are most relevant to our guests when we act and are viewed as a family of local restaurants making a positive difference in each community we operate. ","There are four key growth aspects of the plan; one, continuing to evolve the core menu to reinforce value, expand choice and variety and capitalize on the convenience trend; two, simplifying operations, improving food quality enhancing service; three, implementing a more integrated communications platform to enhance brand relevance; and four bringing the brand a life with every guest touch point. At the beginning of the fourth quarter we introduced new menus at lunch and dinner with significant changes designed to address the consumer needs for increased value and additional choice and variety and convenience. The dinner menu now has a $9.99 price point with the Cucina Mia section in the majority of our restaurants.","We know at this price point and the customization this offer enables is very compelling for our guests, especially millennial and value conscious consumers. We also added a Tastes of Italy section which addresses the guest desire to sample different menu items served topping (ph) style. In addition, we have added seven new specialty items including four new lighter fare entr\u00e9es, buttressing areas of the menu where our guests are looking for more choice. To address convenience, we have successfully tested online ordering which will further strengthen our take-out business, which is approximately 8% of our sales but is currently growing 10%.","During the testing phase, when orders were placed online the check average for those transactions were significantly higher than the orders placed over the phone. Take-out sales in the online restaurants are growing greater than 10%. At lunch, we introduced Tuscan Trio Combinations, nine new items at $2.99, which can be coupled with our soup, salad and bread sticks. These items create many new lunch possibilities at a price point that is very competitive with many casual dining brands and fast casual lunch offerings. Initial feedback from our guests has been favorable and they tell if these items are unique.","They also help us enter into the emerging snack occasion. In terms of choice and variety at lunch, we\u2019ve added sandwich and flatbread combinations as well as mini pasta bowls and small plates. Given that many guests are time constrained at lunch time, we introduced the Pronto Lunch Menu that provides a full Olive Garden experience during the condensed timeframe. ","Looking at 2015, at dinner we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to improve the Cucina Mia platform and increase the number of entr\u00e9es under $15 to bolster our already strong appeal to younger and budget constrained guests.","When you look at Olive Garden\u2019s price points, we have to keep in mind as our guests certainly do, at every meal we serve comes with unlimited salad or soup and bread sticks, thereby dramatically increasing the delivered value versus the competition. New better for you options will also be added to the menu as well as an upgrade of our classic Italian offerings which continue to represent a significant portion of our sales from our dinner menu.","During the midst of rolling-out order to go online ordering system nationally, we expect to have this completed by the end of August. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re encouraged by the initial test results and believe this effort will accelerate the strong growth we\u2019re experiencing to go sales today. Olive Garden\u2019s absolute lunch business is very strong. However, lunch guest counts are declining approximately 80 basis points more than dinner. In order to reverse this trend, we will continue to focus on improving our competitiveness at lunch by expanding our Tuscan Trio Combinations as well as introducing new flatbreads, pizzas and Piadinas, which are Italian style sandwiches.","Also in the works is a test of a lunch time guarantee to ensure our guest with a time constraint can turn to Olive Garden to provide a quick lunch experience. Olive Garden is a high volume, relatively complicated operation that overtime has become increasingly complex. In order to improve execution the team recognized the need to simplify. In fiscal 2014, we focused on simplifying recipes and reducing production pars. These steps led to an annualized savings of $20 million.","We also simplified our take out procedures to improve our ability to deliver a better to bill experience. In terms of improving food and beverage quality, we have installed Piastra grills which improved the quality and consistency of our grilled items. We also improved the quality of our proteins, chicken, steak and salmon. Using higher quality proteins in our specialty dishes, it\u2019s key to ensuring we continue to deliver strong value in entr\u00e9e that appeal to all consumers but especially those consumer segments that provide attractive opportunities for growth.","Additionally, we\u2019ve implemented enhanced service training to reemphasize and reinforce our traditional hospitality and our service culture. This year, we will continue to pursue our culinary simplification program on several fronts, including sauce consolidation and pasta preparation. As I stated earlier, we are aggressively rolling out our online to go ordering platform with the expectation of being completed in August. In terms of improving food and beverage quality, we will elevate and intensify our focus on alcohol beverage sales. We will narrow our focus to one and a few unique specialty cocktails. This is an effort underway to reenergize the wine sampling service step and to increase several wine training and knowledge through mobile apps which will help serve as recommend lines and be comfortable pairing wine with food. ","While there is opportunity to elevate the guest experience throughout the entire system, we have some restaurants that underperformed the system on many performance metrics and these restaurants are significant drag on same restaurant sales. Senior operational leaders have been assigned to these underperforming restaurants and will be accountable to improve their performance. In addition, we are placing increased emphasis on ongoing training and development of all our team members through a recertification process. The objective of this is to ensure the training initiatives we started last year, are gaining traction. Lastly, we are partnering with Ziosk to introduce tabletop tablets to enhance the guest experience. This test is expected to begin in August.","One of the key drivers of the Olive Garden renaissance plan is to develop a truly integrated communication platform to enhance brand relevance. During the past several years, nearly the entire casual dining segment of the restaurant industry has reverted to a nearly 100% reliance on price driven promotional advertising and while promotions are always an important piece of the marketing communications mix, they do not tell the whole story. Importantly, it is impossible to build and maintain a strong brand with only promotional messaging. In fiscal 2014, we begin to place greater emphasis on the brand building portion of our messaging. We developed new creative content to showcase new core menu items and reinforce our culinary credentials. We launched a new interactive Web site, implemented a social media engagement and service recovery program and launched a social media road show to introduce many of our new menu items.","In terms of our promotional efforts, we place greater emphasis on a core menu items with a promotional messaging in order to minimize complexity and maximize appeal. The result has been increased guest preference of the promoted items with less strain upon the operating system to deliver them. We also began to use radio as part of the media mix to support promotions in select markets and we introduce more weekday promotions in order to drive traffic when the guest greatest capacity rather than offering discounts during a highest traffic periods which are on the weekends. ","During fiscal 2015, a new Olive Garden advertising campaign will be unveiled, emphasizing our culinary credentials and the emotional connection that our guests seek when they come to Olive Garden. Creating an emotional connection with our guests help make Olive Garden a leader that it is today and we need to retune using this strategy with greater emphasis. We are increasing our investment in digital and social media tools to drive greater guest engagement and with these tools we will provide much more in the way of regional and personal messaging through customer relationships. In terms of our promotional messaging, we will continue inject new news in our existing promotions and look for innovative, new promotional constructs including the use of more seasonal and regional products as we will offer more targeted, relevant promotional incentives not always about low price to the use of CRM. All that said, while we intend to be much more effective and efficient in our promotional messaging, as stated above we will have a much better balance between our limited time offerings and our equity messaging.","Finally, we are redesigning all of our in restaurant merchandising materials to reinforce Olive Garden\u2019s culinary expertise to elevate menu news and to enhance the ease of menu navigation so that our guest can quickly find their all favorites but also learn about exciting new offerings. The fourth and final driver of our brand renaissance plan is what we call the Olive Garden reimaging program which is intended to bring the renaissance plan to life at every guest touch point. In fiscal 2014, we reimage both the interior and exterior one of our RevItalia restaurants. The new design is natural, up-to date, comfortable and engaging. We also introduced new plateware to enhance the presentation of our food, contemporize the music and work with Lippincott a consulting firm specializing in logo evolution to develop a new logo and visual identity system.","This is an extremely important opportunity because same restaurants sales of a 300 plus restaurants in need of a remodel, lag resulted our other restaurants by more than 2 percentage points. Initial sales results of the remodeled restaurant are very, very encouraging. The sales trends have improved mid-single digit since the completion of the remodel and the new signs were installed. When the RevItalia restaurants in the market have been updated, the Tuscan farmhouse restaurants in the market will also convert to the new logo signage and new plateware package. The Olive Garden brand renaissance is a large and complex initiative with many components. We have already made significant progress in many areas building a strong foundation in fiscal 2014 but most of the changes will to life for our guests in fiscal 2015 and beyond.","Olive Garden is a large business with more than 800 restaurants and 8,000 employees, so we know that it will take time for the brand renaissance to be fully implemented but we are already seeing positive measurable results such as strong preference in menu satisfaction, our new menu items and improvement in our guest satisfaction scores. We are confident that the rate of progress will increase in the quarters ahead at the various aspects of the plan reinforce and build on one another. In fact, in June as we gotten pass some of the year-over-year promotional mismatch we have in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve already seen significant positive trend change compare to the fourth quarter from a same restaurant sales perspective.","I\u2019ll conclude the Olive Garden session with a couple of quick quotes from guests. This quote is from a Yelp event we hosted recently. I\u2019m not usually the first one to say Olive Garden when someone wants the suggestion on where to eat, on Monday that all changed. This is a quick quote for some qualitative research we did after our remodel was complete. I didn\u2019t even know you had a bar before, and now I really want to go in there.","Quickly, we\u2019ll just look at -- we\u2019ll talk about LongHorn. LongHorn has a clear vision as Clarence mentioned they want to be America\u2019s favorite steak house, this multiyear effort is strengthening the brands to create a strong sales momentum to focus on continually improving the menu and enhancing service execution and providing the guests with a great atmosphere, as all of our restaurants have been remodeled and looked and feel refreshed has been the driving force in LongHorn\u2019s out performance in the industry.","As we look at the specialty restaurant group, I think we have strong differentiated well positioned brands and the teams are focused on reviewing same restaurant sales momentum both at Seasons and Yard House. I would just quickly say, I think the Yard House is very well positioned in the market place, as strong appeal the volume in Gen X households. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the restaurants and the real-estate pipeline is strong. Seasons 52 broadly appealing and particularly strong with higher end coming Gen X to improve our sales trends and reverse the trends that we have. The team is focused on elevating operational execution evolving the seasonal regional menu strategy and increasing brand awareness in new markets.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Brad.","Bradford Richmond","We\u2019ve continued to achieve more cost effective platform, transformative changes that we\u2019ve talked on the past in Darden\u2019s operations have significantly reduced costs by over a $150 million annually in selected areas, operating areas around our support including supply chain, facilities management, water and energy usage.","During the past two year, these efforts have supplemented with broad based cost reduction initiatives due to more than anticipated alluded in sales growth recovery reduce of financial crisis in the economic downturn. Despite lower total revenues following the sales of Red Lobster, we expect general and administrative expenses to remain flat at 5% excluding strategic action plan cost.","Now Alvarez & Marsal has continued to assist us with the efforts to identify additional operating support and direct operating cost opportunities, as well as potential revenue enhancement opportunities. And so we expect to further reduce G&A as a percent of sales as we get further into fiscal 2015.","We will minimize the impact of continued commodity cost inflation through other select initiatives to achieve a net inflation, net cost pressures of 1.5% to 2.5% in fiscal 2015. Our $2.5 billion in product expand is now better diversified with less exposure to seafood inflation post the Red Lobster separation. The table in the left shows us in by major category, you can see the change from 2014 to what we anticipate in 2015 with the separation, particularly see a much less of our cost basket coming from seafood cost.","On the right hand side, we outline our coverage of our main products that we purchase as we look through the new fiscal year or in particular June to November of fiscal '15, our first half of the year. The overall coverage at 52% is little wider than it typically is at this point in the cycle for us, given that we believe cost there will elevate it and we expect them to come down. We look at inflation in this area for fiscal 2015 in the 2% to 3% range probably the upper half of that range in the first half of the year. And the lower half of that range in the back half of the year.","As Clarence mentioned earlier, we really increased our focus on driving higher semi front sales and stronger free cash to achieve higher shareholder returns. The annual incentive plan is now weighted 70% on achieving targeted EPS growth and the remaining 30% on targeted same restaurant sales growth. Our performance share units those are a three-year performance period is now based on 50% of achieving targeted total sales growth, 50% on free cash flow targets and a relative TSR performance to the S&P 500 total shareholder return.","On a continuing ops basis, our business generates a substantial and durable operating cash flow. In fiscal 2015, we expect cash provided by operations to be between a $670 million and $730 million. We will pay down approximately $1 billion in debt. The debt leverage that we expect is going to be at the low end of our 55% to 65% and that\u2019s on an adjusted basis treating operating leases as debt equivalents. ","Our debt coverage is unexpectedly above our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times, but it then improves from the year just ended at 3.7 to 3.0 at the end of fiscal 2015. We will also allocate $500 million to an accelerated share repurchase program. And up to $200 million in additional open market repurchases, funded principally from the sale of Red Lobster. We are maintaining our current annual dividend of $2.20, and an approximate total payout of $275 million, and deployed $325 million to $350 million of capital expenditures. This really reflects lower new unit growth, offset slightly by the investment in the Olive Garden remodel program; and all this with the expectation of retaining an investment grade credit profile. ","Turning to some of the more specifics of our outlook for 2015; on this slide we\u2019ve detailed our new unit growth and you can see that 37 net units, that\u2019s down fairly significantly from this year\u2019s 69 or a year before of over a 100 new restaurants. You can see that the growth is concentrated in LongHorn and our specialty restaurants. And there is also the concluding of Olive Garden sites that went well into the growth pipeline. From the same restaurant sales perspective, we look at Olive Garden to be flat to +1%, LongHorn of +1% to +2%, and our specialty restaurants at approximately 2%. All of these performances would be above the industry expectations.","On the next slide, we outline our operating cash flow, and you can see, as I mentioned earlier, $670 million to $730 million there, obviously driven by earnings. This does include the portion of cash flow that is generated by Red Lobster, prior to the sale. You see our expectations for depreciation and amortization. Working capital, there is an improvement there, extra Red Lobster business, and we have reflected that. And the other cash items really highlight the progress that we have been making and continue to expect in better managing our balance sheet as well as the cash flow benefits of our tax planning initiatives. So the least cash available for dividends and share repurchases is at $320 million to $405 million.","As I mentioned earlier, our capital expenditures are down, you can see the new units today as I outlined earlier, will result in about a $150 million of capital employed towards those. Remodels principally all related to Olive Garden as well there will be some CIP for that as we end the year to continue that program. And then we will continue to invest and maintain our restaurant standards and cooking equipment standards, and so maintenance CapEx will be in $125 million to $150 million. As I mentioned earlier, maintaining our dividend at $2.20 and share repurchases in total up to $700 million. ","So, back to this page that I took us to, as we looked at fiscal 2014 to better understand and help you get your hands around our performance; and from an EPS perspective here, the prior year comparison is the performance EPS that I laid out earlier, of $1.71; we think it is the right benchmark. We expect to report $1.81 to $1.90 for a diluted EPS. Now, again we have to adjust the support cost for the period that Red Lobster is a part of Darden, though support cost which we know will go away are deductions to ours (ph) that\u2019s what we anticipate it on $0.02 that we need to add those back to the reported continuing operations number.","And, as I mentioned earlier, we are paying down $1 billion of debt. There are some estimated debt breakage related to that of approximately $0.39. So that puts us at a continuing operations performance view, earning fully diluted EPS of $2.22 to $2.30. And that\u2019s a 30% to 35% increase above the prior year. But there are some clear and distinct drivers of that. Those are highlighted in the lower right-hand portion of that. The results that we expect from our core operating performance driven by the same restaurant sales and the cost initiatives should drive 10% to 15% EPS growth. We talked about the reduced interest expense related to that debt reduction that drives about 12% of EPS growth and the share count reduction from the share buyback that we talked about drives 5% growth, and just add a little bit more confusion to the work that we have to do next year will be a 53rd week for us, and so there is a 3% earnings growth related to sales from that extra week, so netting to a 30% to 35% increase and earnings per share. ","Now, I would point out that the share buyback really won\u2019t begin after the closing of the Red Lobster deal as well as the debt breakage. So you can see the annualized impact actually adds another 6% in EPS growth that will be realized in the first quarter of following fiscal year of fiscal year \u201916.","So with that let me turn it back to Clarence for a few more comments.","Clarence Otis","Thank you, Brad. And so we think that we have a very strong competitive position and that starts with a well positioned, much better positioned portfolio brand that can deliver balanced same restaurant, new restaurant sales growth which will leverage our operating support and restaurant support cost. We are committed to proactive, ongoing, cost optimization to amplify the leverage that we get from growing sales and ensure consistent margin expansion and earrings growth that will result in consistently strong cash flow growth to support meaningful ongoing return to capital shareholders again through dividends and share repurchase. And more than sufficient operating cash flow to address the emerging trends as they develop. With this competitive position, we are confident that we can return to industry leading financial performance with on a sustained basis mid-to-high single digit annual sales growth, low-to-mid teen annual operating income growth, and $350 million or more in annual return of capital to shareholders.","So with that, we will open it up for your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Mr. Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America","Thank you. I\u2019d like to ask a few questions on Olive Garden, so the remodel information you shared with us, was that based on one restaurant or maybe more than that? And then you mentioned your underperformers kind of pulling down the brand performance, how many stores are in that underperformed group and what are the common characteristics of that underperformed group? And maybe just one more, in the same-store sales projections for this year while improved particularly at Olive Garden are pretty low and what happens to margins given those same-stores sale projections, I noticed the fourth quarter LongHorn\u2019s operating profit was down per year tax, do you need strong comps than that to get restaurant level margins healthier?","Eugene Lee","The initial results I gave on the remodel were just the one restaurant we have up at Fort Walton Beach and it\u2019s obviously very-very early, but we can isolate that restaurant to see what happened, it will be a little bit more time before we have a good what I can say statistically significant sample. As far as the underperformers, you always have a bottom quartile. What we try to do is get to the bottom quintile and then subdivide that even more, get this down to like 50 restaurants that are really having a significant impact on the system. I would say they\u2019re between 7% and 10% below the system average. And the characteristics around them are; first, majority of them are older restaurants that haven\u2019t been renovated, we have probably weaker management teams there, our attributes, our ratings on prudent service aren\u2019t close to the system average. And it\u2019s really getting back to some really restaurant basics in there and ensuring that we\u2019re delivering the guest experience.","Bradford Richmond","Yes, and on margins, we expect Olive Garden to expand at -- at Olive Garden not as much as the other businesses and to your point really driven by same restaurant sales, but they would still have margins that increase in the 20 to 25 basis point range. And even across Darden with the work that we\u2019ve done on the G&A cost the things that we\u2019ve talked about some in the marketing or selling area as well as what\u2019s driven by the same restaurants sales. And the cost environments were -- the cost pressures that I mentioned are not too severe. We were able to greatly mitigate those when you look even across Darden you\u2019re looking that operating profit margins will expand in that 20 to 50 basis points range depending on which end of the guidance that, that you look at.","Operator","","Thank you, our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer and Company.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer and Company","","Thank you and good morning. First is a clarification question, did that operating cash flow guidance for 2015 include or exclude Red Lobster\u2019s earnings? Because I thought it\u2019s still -- I thought I saw it say includes Red Lobster\u2019s earnings? ","Bradford Richmond","","It includes it for the approximate period that we would own that business still, so you know that\u2019ll be just part of the first quarter.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer and Company","","Okay, so it\u2019s a question I have is really at almost based on the EPS guidance and you are kind of close to that 100% dividend payout ratio here. And when I look at the operating cash flow guidance you are assuming working capital inflows and some other inflows from non-cash items. And I guess, the question is how confident are you that you can really maintain the $2.20 dividend going forward and how much does it rely on continued influence from working capital in certain items like that.","Bradford Richmond","","Obviously as we look to fiscal 2015 there is contributions in cash flows from these other items but also the reduction in CapEx that we\u2019ve done, leaves sufficient room for us to maintain our 2.20 targeted dividend. From there I think the platform that we\u2019ve laid out, the initiatives we have underway, earnings will grow and so the contributions from operating cash flow would grow and continue to allow us to have a $2.20 dividend and depending on the rate of those earnings growth the opportunity to modestly to start growing that dividend rate beyond 2015.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer and Company","","[Question Inaudible] ","Clarence Otis","","The new restaurant piece obviously of the capital budget is discretionary and we demonstrated that with the scale back that we accomplished in fiscal \u201914 on the new restaurant side.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer and Company","","I see, so if, you know we saw a scenario where earnings didn\u2019t grow as much as you expect in 2015, do you think there would be some [Indiscernible] on the CapEx to still be able to maintain that dividend.","Bradford Richmond","","Yes, we see sufficient room to make the adjustments that we need to make to maintain the dividend to work at our debt metrics as well to have that investment\u2019s credit profile, so we see the ability to do both really.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer and Company","","Okay and then jus the second and final question is on LongHorn. Revenue growth was up double digits. And as Gene said, and you say in the press release that operating profit -- dollars actually declined year-over-year. Can you just walk through that a little bit more and the dynamics there?","Bradford Richmond","","LongHorn profitability, I mean it continues to grow fuelled a lot by the unit growth, we do see the margins there expanding, their particular brand performance is a little bit muted by the elevated beef cost and we see those continuing but still good progress from that brand, new unit growth is profitable and when you have same restaurant sales growth as strong as they do well above industry average, we\u2019re able to leverage those as well. ","Clarence Otis","","And I would say also Brian, as we look into fiscal 2015, with the slowdown in unit growth at LongHorn and there are a lot of new restaurant opening expenses not just direct from the restaurant opening expenses but manager training, all those sorts of things, in the model that will be a lot lower in \u201915 than they were in \u201914 with the unit growth pace cut in half.","Operator","","Thank you, and once again participants may I request everyone to please to limit yourself with one question and one follow up, our next question is coming from the line of Ms. Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein, Ma\u2019am your line\u2019s now open.","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein","","Thank you very much. I do have one follow up and one question. The follow up was just on the Olive Garden remodeling I think you said unremodeled restaurants lag by 2 percentage points and so it sounds like the core restaurants are still comping negatively and the remodeling isn\u2019t having as much of a lift as I would have thought, because I thought it\u2019s sort of 3% to 4%, so, if you could just clarify that and then the first question is, the real question is, can you talk about whether Alvarez and Marsal has identified any kind of unit level cost saves, I think you mentioned G&A savings, further G&A savings but it seems like if you\u2019re going to invest in improved food and service for the Olive Garden you probably need to fund that with maybe cost savings elsewhere, thank you.","Clarence Otis","","I\u2019ll start, on the remodel side, I think what Gene was saying is that the restaurants that have not been remodeled are the ones that are in need of a remodel are lagging by about 2 points, now we\u2019ve had some remodels in the past that have had a lift of 3, 4 percentage points but we paused on them because we believe that they really didn\u2019t have the kind of shelf life going forward that we needed, that they didn\u2019t make dramatic enough change, and so we would hope that, this new remodel, and again it\u2019s too early to tell but at least 2% to 3% to 4% and perhaps more than that. And then on Alvarez and Marsal, they\u2019re working to identify four wall opportunities, but Dave George and the team at Olive Garden have been working on that as well. And so to some of the simplification work that they have done, they have taken out about $20 million of cost on an annualized basis and they\u2019ve reinvested a significant amount of that in food quality and some of the other things that Gene mentioned already.","Eugene Lee","And I would add that on, from A&M\u2019s perspective where they really were able to help us is on the marketing side, help accelerate our attack on nonworking media cost, and so that\u2019s been a big help and we think there is big dollars there. And there is some other marketing ideas that they have that we\u2019re planning on implementing I think those are all going to be cost saves.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Palmer from RBC. Sir, your line is now open.","David Palmer - RBC","Thank you, good morning. You\u2019ve mentioned the June to-date sales for Olive Garden -- you understand that goes short-term influences on the sale like the promotion timing, the media wave better than us, can you evaluate that and perhaps just comment on what do you think that this June result is indicative or the kind of sales you\u2019ll see perhaps for the first half in fiscal \u201915 and why some of the -- why this is truly is a turning, what are the factors driving the turn specifically in terms of your initiative? Thanks.","Clarence Otis","So, I will start. I would just say promotionally June lines up pretty well year-over-year and so we don\u2019t have a lot of promotional noise in the June to-date numbers, but June we might wind up.","Bradford Richmond","David, I would say that we\u2019ve been working hard to gain guest count momentum. If you look back in the fourth quarter, guest counts in March were down 61 affected somewhat by weather April 35, May rolling down 17 and the majority of that was one week when we had some promotional transitional issues, but June\u2019s comes back and been pretty solid. We think it\u2019s just a result of the focused efforts that we put on this brand from an operational standpoint from food service. We think our advertises are getting a little sharper a little bit more focused again it just -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019re on a straight line up to 3% to 4% comps, but I do think that we\u2019re putting in the effort and we\u2019re making some improvement and the guests are telling us that by coming to our restaurants more often.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Gene, if I could first ask you to clarify last comment? Your mix was down pretty substantially in May, so your traffic was better, but the mix was worse. So you traded -- it seems like you traded one for the others. Is that correct? Is that the way you would look at it going forward that you will take a lower check for the traffic? Or was that just a monthly?","Eugene Lee","I think that was just a monthly skew where we were out there in May with our classic promotion at $10 and last year we had a different type of promotion that didn\u2019t impact check averages as much. I was pleased with May\u2019s results even though we did have a mix change. I thought getting our classics which represented close to 20% of the sales in the May into our guest, on the table for our guest was a really good thing to remind them about some of the reasons why they really love Olive Garden and I think that momentum is carrying on through June.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","And then on the SG&A or the G&A savings, where were you just up the benchmark -- where were you in G&A as percentage of sales in the fourth quarter after you\u2019ve striped out all of Red Lobster? What\u2019s the progression of events in \u201915? How quickly can you keep getting if there was -- it\u2019s above five materially ex-advertising how fast can you get it to five?","Clarence Otis","Well, we\u2019ll get it to five in the fiscal year and I\u2019m looking up your question there, fourth quarter.","Eugene Lee","Yes, we may have to get back to you with this John perhaps flipping through some pages, but we\u2019ll get back to you. I think for the full year it\u2019s 5%, so we expect to get to that level pretty quickly.","Clarence Otis","The SAP costs that I\u2019ve laid out there are virtually\u2026","Eugene Lee","SAP, strategic action plans.","Clarence Otis","In the G&A line there I think maybe to the heart what you giving as we look forward. We talk about a flat G&A at 5% with the opportunity in \u201915 as we get through more the A&M work and things we\u2019re doing to take that even lower. In the year, but at a flat 5%, that\u2019s implying an absolute reduction of well over a $100 million of G&As and granted there is about say 75 million of that, that is either allocated or directly within Red Lobster that goes away. There are some stranded G&As of about $20 million, which says we\u2019ve already got well over $50 million of G&A reductions that stays within the Darden continuing operations and more than offsets the stranded G&A cost over there. So we were really pleased with the progress and those plans are largely all in place and delivering the expected results.","","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","If I could just ask one final question. On the low to mid teen operating profit growth longer term, how do you -- in an industry that grows comps at a very low single digit rate, you\u2019re going to square footage at least this current year at a very low single digit rate. How do you get there? Or is it presumed that you are a unit grower -- a much more materially faster unit grower in the future again?","Clarence Otis","Well let me start it out and then I will turn it over to Clarence. I think even if you look at the guidance that we have -- our expectations for fiscal 2015, on the composition of same restaurant sales growth that we have, a cost environment, where commodity costs are in that 2% to 3% range. Through all that we\u2019re still able to generate what I call a core operating profit growth of 10% to 15%. That\u2019s pretty significant. There is a little bit of unit growth but a much more moderated pace that we think is appropriate for our businesses and for a large chain. And then, with that there\u2019s strong cash flows that will allow us to begin growing the dividend and repurchase shares so that those repurchased shares also aid EPS growth as well as its how you get into that low double digit mid-teen range.","Clarence Otis","And I would say the portfolio of new Darden, in an industry that\u2019s challenged is strongly positioned against the healthiest parts of the industry. So when you look at Olive garden and LongHorn, but also the specialty restaurants strongly positioned against the healthiest parts. The brands also have very strong -- in the new Darden X Red Lobster very strong, restaurant level returns and with the support cost activities that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019re able to realize a lot of that restaurant level return.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays. Ma\u2019am, your line is now open.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays","One, just a point of clarification, that around the 3.7 times leverage that you mentioned for fiscal year \u201914, that includes $1 billion of notional debt reduction, correct? And then secondly, as you map to getting the three times leverage at the end of fiscal \u201915, a lot of it is predicated on you hitting that cooperating profit growth target, but what other levers could you pull, if for some reason you start to fall towards the lower end or below that? Thanks.","Bradford Richmond","Well, first on the 3.7 times, that\u2019s adjusted debt-to-adjusted capital. So we\u2019re treating those operating leases as debt equivalents, which they are. That\u2019s the range of the end of fiscal \u201914. The outlook that we\u2019ve laid out here gets us to 3 times, 3.0 times into fiscal \u201915. And so that\u2019s our expectations there. Like so the other key thing is the cash flows and to a degree there\u2019s shortages on the operating cash flow as Clarence outlined earlier is that we\u2019ve clearly demonstrated our willingness and ability to work on the CapEx side, particularly around new unit growth. And so that would be obviously the first item that we would look to. Olive Garden remodeled CapEx. We know it was very important. That delivers results that we\u2019re anticipating. We would probably keep that in there. That would be hard to touch and obviously, maintenance CapEx. There\u2019s pretty significant operating cash flows. We want to protect that as well. So the real opportunity is around new unit CapEx and the others would be more difficult for us to change but if needed, we could.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays","And just, I think you might have misunderstood the first question. The 3.7 times number, that you have at the end of fiscal \u201914, is that on a reported basis using your current debt or is that adjusting out the $1 billion of notional debt reduction you expect to occur as a result of the Red Lobster proceeds?","Bradford Richmond","That includes the reduction of debt from the Red Lobster proceeds, I\u2019m sorry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jonathan Compt (ph).","Bradford Richmond","Wait a second let me finish that question. I misunderstood, the 3.7 is the reported number at the end of fiscal year that does not include unit reduction. That\u2019s based on our reported numbers.","Matthew Stroud","Sorry, that\u2019s the last question. We are out of time here today. We appreciate those of you joining us and listening in and those that asked questions. Of course we\u2019re here in Orlando if you have further questions and further follow ups. We look forward to talking to many of you in the near future. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

These results were available on PR Newswire and other wire services. We recognize that most of you have reviewed our third quarter earnings results, so we won't take the time to go through them in detail, once again in an effort to provide more time for your questions. We will offer a line item summary of the P&L, discuss our financial outlook for fiscal 2013 and discuss some of our brand-by-brand operating performance.","To begin, Brad will provide detail about our financial results for the third quarter. Drew will briefly discuss our larger brands, and Clarence will offer some closing comments. We will then respond to your questions.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","C. Bradford Richmond","Thank you, Matthew, and good morning to everyone. Darden's total sales from continuing operations increased 4.6% in the third quarter to $2.26 billion. Included in this quarterly amount is approximately $87 million in sales from Yard House, which we acquired on August 29, 2012.","On a blended same-restaurant sales basis, the results for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse declined 4.6% in the third quarter. In contrast, our Specialty Restaurant Group saw continued same-restaurant sales gains of 2.3% on a blended basis.","Food and beverage expense for the third quarter were approximately 20 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis. This unfavorability was driven by our promotional mix and higher costs for beef, partially offset by lower seafood costs.","For the third quarter, restaurant labor expenses were approximately 100 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to higher group insurance, wage inflation and sales deleverage, partially offset by reduced manager incentive compensation of approximately 60 basis points.","Restaurant expenses in the quarter were approximately 110 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis, mostly due to sales deleverage, about 50 basis points, and the impact of adding Yard House, about 30 basis points, which runs a higher restaurant expense as a percentage of sales than our other brands because all of the Yard House restaurants are leased.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 30 basis points lower than last year as a percentage of sales due primarily to reduced incentive compensation of approximately 100 basis points, partially offset by media inflation. Depreciation expense in the quarter was approximately 40 basis points higher on a percentage of sales basis compared to last year because of increases in new units and remodel programs at our larger brands.","Overall, operating profit margins for the third quarter were down approximately 230 basis points to 9.1%. Yard House accounted for 40 basis points of the year-over-year decline because of acquisition-related costs and a slightly lower margin at the operating profit level.","Our tax rate this quarter, at 22.3%, was approximately 240 basis points lower than the prior year, driven by increases in available tax credits and our tax planning initiatives, as well as lower taxable earnings. We estimate that our annual effective rate will be in the mid-22% range, which is about 200 to 300 basis points lower than last year's effective tax rate.","Now turning to our financial outlook. For the full fiscal year, we expect combined same-restaurant sales for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse of approximately down 1.5% to 2.5%, and we expect net new restaurant increase of roughly 105 restaurants, which is approximately 5% unit growth on our current base. With these same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant openings expectations, combined with the acquisition of Yard House, we expect total sales growth in fiscal 2013 of between 6% and 7%, and that diluted net earnings per share growth from continuing operations for the year will be between $3.06 and $3.22. The expectation regarding diluted earnings per share includes acquisition-related costs and purchase accounting adjustments of approximately $0.09.","Turning to our commodities basket. We have approximately 90% of our total food spend contracted through the end of this fiscal year. Food inflation in the third quarter was approximately 0.4% with seafood deflation in the mid-single digits and beef inflation in the low double digits.","For the fourth quarter, we expect that our commodities basket will see inflation in the range of 1% to 1.5%. Category-by-category, through the balance of fiscal 2013, seafood costs are lower on a year-over-year basis with 100% of our usage covered. Beef costs are higher on a year-over-year basis with 80% of our usage covered. Poultry costs are moderately higher on a year-over-year basis with 100% of our usage covered. Wheat costs are slightly higher on a year-over-year basis with 100% of our usage covered. And dairy costs are moderately higher on a year-over-year basis with 60% of our usage covered.","Our energy costs are expected to be slightly lower on a year-over-year basis, and we have contracted 30% of our natural gas and electricity in the deregulated markets in which we operate through fiscal year 2013.","And now I'll turn it over to Drew to comment on our brands.","Andrew H. Madsen","Thank you, Brad. Since many of you attended or listened to our recent Analyst and Investor Meeting a few weeks ago, I thought our time this morning would be better spent only briefly commenting on the third quarter performance of our larger brands.","As we mentioned at that meeting, same-restaurant sales results for the third quarter at the larger brands were much weaker than we anticipated. Our priority now is regaining same-restaurant traffic momentum.","This quarter, same-restaurant traffic at our 3 large brands was negative and certainly some of the external factors we're all aware of including the payroll tax increase, the spike in gasoline prices and more severe winter weather this year contributed to that. Still, we are encouraged that after trailing the industry the prior 3 quarters, same-restaurant traffic at our larger brands was in line with the industry this quarter. And we are also encouraged that same-restaurant sales for the industry have improved so far in March as we assumed in the same-restaurant sales guidance that we provided at our analyst conference.","Another thing we also discussed in February is that for many guests, affordability is a particularly important need. These guests want to visit casual dining restaurants generally and our restaurants in particular more often than they do today, but they feel they cannot afford it. It's important to keep in mind, however, that not all guests are focused solely on greater affordability. There are also economically secure guests who are looking for distinctive higher-quality dishes and are willing to pay a little more for them.","And while millennials are focused on affordability, they have other needs and desires as well, including an interest in more convenience in their total restaurant experience, menus that offer more freshness and greater flexibility to dine the way they want. We are responding tactically in ways that address on a day-to-day and a week-to-week basis the current need many guests have for affordability. At the same time, we are working strategically to evolve our brands so that they are sustainably affordable for financially constrained guests, and so that they meet the broader needs of all other guests.","Our traffic results for the quarter relative to the industry indicate we're making some progress tactically. And while some of the strategic changes to redefine the guest experiences we offer are in their early stages, we're confident in our direction on this front as well.","Now Clarence has some final comments.","Clarence Otis","Thanks, Drew. As we mentioned last month at our Analyst Investor Meeting here in Orlando, we are, for sure, in a new era for dining out that's the product of some important new competitive and consumer realities. And as Drew mentioned, we're making significant changes to make sure we take advantage of these realities. We're changing so that we're better able to more consistently win in the marketplace today and better able to win on the sustained basis well into the future.","The changes we're making involve reshaping our portfolio to increase the size and contribution of Specialty Restaurant Group, which is something that broadens our guest and occasion base. They involve reshaping our organization so that there are dedicated resources working on 2 time horizons, today and tomorrow, which are time horizons that involve distinctive work.","The changes we're making also involve tempering average check growth across our larger brands because we think that's what it takes to support same-restaurant traffic growth. They involve reducing unit growth at Olive Garden so the brand can better focus on regaining momentum. And the changes involve continuing to invest in our people who are the best in the business and who are the key to any success that we're going to have in any time horizon.","We think we're well positioned as an organization given the strength of our brands, the collective experience and expertise we have, the operating cash flows we have to make the changes that are needed. And so we're confident as we look forward in the direction of our business.","And with that, we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","My question is related to the trends you're seeing in March. Drew, I think you mentioned that the industry trends have started to improve in March, and I'm just wondering if you could maybe talk about your business and maybe give a sense of the magnitude of the improvement that you've seen, and whether you're currently running in line with your plan for the current quarter.","Clarence Otis","David, this is Clarence, and we will talk about the industry, but not about our business, which is our practice. And what we would say -- and I think Malcolm Knapp was on Bloomberg yesterday, so this is comments that he made. And he's, for a lot of reasons, has a very good look at what's going on in the industry. And the turn in March has been significant. I mean, February was a month that was down mid-single digits in the casual dining part of the industry and March is a positive month, and so a pretty significant turn. We think February suffered beyond weather from really, as Drew mentioned, the consumers just weren't prepared despite all the conversation for the payroll tax increase, and there was a pretty rapid spike up in gasoline prices. But March indicates that consumers have adjusted. When we talk about our expectations for the year from a same-restaurant perspective, from an earnings perspective, we assume that the industry would bounce back.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And I guess just maybe a quick follow-up on that. As you look at the overall consumer environment, it has been choppy lately. And I guess, how are you viewing the March trend? Is this consistent with what your economic models and your thoughts on the overall consumer environment should be going forward, or how should...","Clarence Otis","Yes. I think we look beyond the month. And so as we look back over the last 12 months, our point of view is the next 12 is not going to be all that different. And so if GDP growth is roughly 2%, a little bit less than that, it's going to be roughly 2% going forward is how we think about it, maybe slightly more than that. But there's probably equal probabilities on slightly more, slightly less. And so that's sort of how we're planning the business around that point of view.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Omohundro with Davenport & Company.","Jeffrey F. Omohundro - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","First, on the Olive Garden and relative value, it does appear that in the category we're seeing quite a bit of abundance offers, abundance strategies and a lot of clutter out there. I'm just wondering in terms of your comfort with the -- or need to tweak the current strategy really to break through that and connect more on abundance with guests, just what your thinking might be around that. And then I have a follow-up on Red Lobster.","Andrew H. Madsen","So certainly as we've said, we need to address affordability more aggressively than we have been doing. We've started that and we are seeing an improvement in traffic in all 3 of our large brands, including Olive Garden. In terms of abundance, we want to make sure that while we are addressing affordability, we're also evolving the guest experiences that each brand offers in ways that keeps them distinct and relevant and highly compelling. So generosity has always been an important part of Olive Garden's promise, which is what's helped them be one of the strongest overall value leaders in the industry. So we're confident that, that's going to continue to be a part of the experience that we offer. But we're going to have to go beyond that because it's clear now that there are other meaningful guest segments that want aspects to their experience that we are not now providing, so lighter, fresher is one example. That's why we introduced that section on the menu recently. Convenience and speed of service at lunch, in particular, is another one that we're working on. So generosity and abundance will be part of it, but we want to keep very distinct compelling brands going forward and that's true for Olive Garden as well.","Jeffrey F. Omohundro - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","And then on Red Lobster, I'm just wondering regarding the Seaside Express test, just how that fits in perhaps with the longer-term concept evolution.","Andrew H. Madsen","Well, that's a test that we have just started in the last week at a couple locations locally. So it's too soon to comment on the -- what we're seeing there. But we would say that the lunch daypart, in particular, is one where we know that for a large number of guests affordability and speed, convenience is very important. And lunch is a big growth opportunity for Red Lobster, in particular, and that's really why they're looking at this sort of test to just more aggressively address the need for affordability and convenience and overall speed and experience. But very, very early at this stage.","Clarence Otis","The other thing I would say, Jeff, is so we've got delivering 2 experiences in 2 different dining rooms. So conventional, full service lunch experience in one, the express lunch in another. We will very closely watch the guest experience in the more conventional dining room to see how guests in that dining room feel about the whole experience with what's going on elsewhere in the building and that'll be an important part of whether this thing is successful or not.","Operator","Our next question from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just want to go back to this tempering of the average check growth and the strategy there. Is it something that is going to be gradual over time, or is it there going to be a step change in the menu that we're going to see? And just going forward in general, I mean, how big of a handle as you implement this change are you really going to have on the ability to kind of tweak the average check growth, and why not just allow check growth to possibly decline because it feels though if you did that and you got the traffic, that would probably be applauded.","Clarence Otis","Well, I think a couple of things. One is it is tempering check growth as opposed to check decline and will be gradual, and they'll be driven by couple things. And so one is our promotional mix and that's gradual almost by definition because the preference on promotions ranges from 5% to something more like high single digit, which is typical. A blockbuster promotion would be 15% to 20% and so that's, by definition, going to be gradual effect. And then the second part of it really is making sure that we introduce platforms on the core menu that have more approachable pricing and those platforms are going to get some preference, but there's still going to be a fair amount of preference elsewhere on the core menu. And the reason why we wouldn't drop check average is because that sort of preference elsewhere on the core menu is not asking for a lower check. I mean, so if you think about a Red Lobster $12.99 promotion and you might get 15% preference on that at dinner and that total check may be $15.50, $16, the other 85% preference is at a check that's north of $20. And so to drop that price when that's not what those folks are looking for, they're looking for us to redefine the experience in ways that drive up quality and may actually be willing to pay a little bit more if we can do that effectively.","Operator","Our next question from Michael Kelter, Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I wanted to ask -- you guys talked about traffic being in line with the industry for the quarter, but I guess my question is at what cost? Because your restaurant margins were the lowest in a fiscal third quarter for as far back as my model goes, and I guess I'm wondering is that the new normal? Will it require margin investment just to maintain share at this point?","C. Bradford Richmond","No. The investment in check we made during the third quarter, specifically during the third quarter, was a little more than we anticipated and we've learned some things during the quarter that we're going to apply to our promotions and core menu tactics in the near term going forward. But we are seeing meaningful improvement in traffic. So for instance, at Olive Garden during the second quarter, traffic was 5.5 points behind the industry. In the third quarter, traffic was even. A little more investment in check than we anticipated, like I said, during the quarter and we've identified some ways that we can help address that.","Clarence Otis","I would say that the third quarter was a relatively weak quarter overall for the industry, and so being even in that quarter had margin effects because being even meant being relatively negative. And so we don't expect, on a go-forward basis, that kind of industry weakness. And then the other part of it, as Brad talked about, when we look forward next couple of years, given the strategic choices that we're making, we would expect EBIT margin expansion of 10 to 30 basis points a year. That is lower than what we would have told you a couple of years ago, which would have been more like 30 to 50 basis points a year, but still EBIT margin expansion.","C. Bradford Richmond","Also, Michael, when you look particularly at the third quarter there's about 35, 40 basis points of Yard House acquisition-related impacts. So if you're comparing backwards, there's a little noise in the number there as well.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then on a separate note. I was curious to give -- get a little color. What have the rating agencies asked of you to maintain your credit rating at this point? And what does that mean about your debt leverage levels and the capital allocation going forward?","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes. We've shared our plans with much of the information that we shared at the investor and analyst conference, we shared that with them as well as some of our thinking that we outlined for the next fiscal year. And so if you look at many things, they also look at the trend of things as well. But our amount of debt or the ratio of debt that we have is within -- will be within the year within the range that we target to maintain investment grade credit profile. Our coverage ratios are a little bit outside of that range. And so they looked at that, within the past few weeks they've come out and have changed their outlook to negative. But they haven't changed any of the ratings at this point. So they're going to look at many of the same things that you're looking at from where the business is, how is it trending on sales and operating cash flows. What I would say is they look back at our history of how we've adjusted and reacted to other business environments and situations and that we do have for an organization of our size, a number of levers, a number of activities, many of which we are doing right now to protect that investment grade credit profile. So no one has downgraded the stock at this point, but they do have a negative outlook. In terms of maintaining an investment grade rating, right now we're at the equivalent of BBB with the 3 agencies that are rating us, and so we do have room should we need it for one level of downgrade and still remain investment grade profile and advantages that come with that.","Clarence Otis","But I would say that we're very focused on maintaining an investment grade credit profile, and so we will make capital allocation choices that are consistent with that. If you look back over our history since our spin-off, we've been downgraded before. We've been upgraded from those levels because we've demonstrated that kind of discipline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Susan Scribner with Credit Suisse. It's Keith Signer.","Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, it's Keith Siegner. To follow up on that question quickly. Just the dividend that was just declared, the $0.50, sounds like it was the last dividend at $0.50. It was very clear at the Analyst Day that you have plans to increase it. When thinking through this maintaining of an investment grade credit profile, et cetera, et cetera, and you think about this upcoming increase in the dividend, what factors are you looking in deciding how much to increase it? What fits in with the broader capital management strategy?","Clarence Otis","Yes. Well, we're looking at our CapEx budget. And to the extent that we bring that down fairly significantly, it accommodates a modest dividend increase in our view.","Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, one other question for me. Clarence, you talked several minutes ago about the tempering of average check growth and one of the things that was part of that was using promos especially to address the lower end or affordability. At Olive Garden, the 2 for $25 promo is ending soon, I think April 7. Could that possibly be replaced with a promo that's more geared towards the lower check or addressing the entry-level affordability, because I think one of the plans at 2 for $25 was that it actually wasn't resulting in a lower check per person. Could that change with the promos at Olive Garden going forward?","Clarence Otis","2 for $25 does result in a lower check. But beyond that, we're not going to comment about our promotional plans for competitive reasons.","Operator","Our next question with Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. Again, on the promotional positioning of the brands. I understand the 15%-85% split. What gives you confidence that you can manage the check up and don't have to do something much more dramatic to improve the value ratings of the brand? What was seen promotionally from you doesn't appear to be really new or different or aggressive on your part given the traffic trends.","Andrew H. Madsen","Well, I would say in terms of addressing affordability and value promotions is one lever that we're pulling. And based on the traffic trend improvement and the percent of guests that are ordering those dishes, it certainly has been noticed by our guests. But in addition, we're doing other things on our core menu. So for instance, the significant core menu change at Red Lobster that really increased the preference on items under $15 is working together with the promotions that we're offering. And we are seeing improvement in value scores, value perception at Red Lobster as a result. So it isn't just what we're doing in our promotions to strengthen value and affordability.","Clarence Otis","And I would say the core menu is the key, and I would lock in on 15%. That would be a blockbuster preference for a promotion. Red Lobster does have higher preference than Olive Garden. But double digit would be fairly significant for either one of them.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then a numbers question. Brad, I've got a lot of questions on since your meeting. It's a bonus reset comments for next year in the $0.30 to $0.34. So I guess a couple of questions. Did it have anything to do with fiscal '12? I think in your comments at the meeting, you made reference fiscal 2012, it's not clear to me it would have anything to do with that? So I'm trying to clarify if you meant to say that or there is some connection there? And then how definitive is that $0.30 to $0.34? How performance based is that number or how automatic does that number become in fiscal 2014?","Clarence Otis","Yes, let me start, and I'll hand it off to Brad. But we have a bonus pool, absolute dollar amount, that doesn't vary much from year-to-year and that assumes that we achieve the plan for the year. To the extent that we fall short of that plan, we're going to pay out a lot less and that payout can be dramatically less. There is a floor for about 60% of that bonus pool it goes to restaurant managers essentially, and they don't go to 0 regardless of performance. But for the other 40%, it can go to 0. And so when we talk about a planned bonus number for next year, it depends on performance. If it's a performance like this year, then it certainly won't be $0.32 to $0.35. It'll be dramatically less than that. We hope it's 32% (sic) ($0.32) to 35% (sic) ($0.35). That would be our preference.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, I think Clarence said it pretty well. I guess the only thing I would add is making that plan, paying out those targeted bonus, that's what we would accrue to. You see this year, we are much under that. So we've been adjusting that accrual down throughout the year as our performance has dictated. I think the other piece of information just to reflect back a year, what would be fiscal 2012, we anticipated a higher bonus payout. We started accruing to that. But as the year went on, we accrued less. In that case, it's going back to that pool that Clarence was talking about. It was about $0.15 less. So we're telling you what it would be for achieving our plan. We could exceed that plan, which would add meaningful to the earnings value creation, but a portion of that would go out into bonus payouts as well. So we've got a couple of years where the accrual has been too high, and we've adjusted it down. And so what we're really pointing out as we look to '14 is how much that accrual going back to a targeted amount would expect to be. So -- and to your point, it could still change some this year depending on our actual performance. So we'll update you on what that amount looks like in June.","Operator","Our next question from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Actually, if I can just first follow-up on that bonus question. Whether or not it goes up or down depending on performance is understood, but the absolute magnitude is what I think that still strikes in investors as being high in dollars and I understand a lot of it is at the store level. Do you feel like you're -- are you overcompensating your store-level employees relative to peers in line or under and so willing to, I guess, normalize their compensation versus peers or do you feel like that's not an issue?","Clarence Otis","No, I would say, I mean, we do market studies all the time and we're certainly in line with peers. And these are peers who run restaurants that have similar complexity. That means similar volumes, similar staffing. And so we've got volumes and staffing above the industry average and so that peer group is not an industry average peer group. It's the high-volume portion of the industry.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And if I could follow up on this debt question. I don't want to beat it death, but as I understand it and I'm sorry I don't have the numbers in front of me, but your check decline at Olive Garden this quarter, given promotional activity, the traffic improved. But your goal was not to have -- will be to have traffic -- check growth essentially flat, right, maybe mix to negative mix offsetting pricing, is that right? And have you ever had that --  if you had that experience yet, or is it still hypothetical and you haven't really figured out the real balance yet between the right promotions in driving traffic and keeping checks sort of flat?","Andrew H. Madsen","Yes. Our expectation is not for the check at Olive Garden or any of our brands to be down versus prior year over an extended period. And so the changes that we're making tactically in our promotions being more aggressively focused on affordability, as well as the changes we're making on affordability in our core menus are all things that are moving us in the right direction from a traffic standpoint, but there are also things we're learning from -- as we go. So we wouldn't anticipate in the future the same check dynamics that we saw during the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Bernstein, Barclays.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 questions. First, on the labor side of things. It seems like that's perhaps a greater concern than commodities, which has gotten more of the attention over the past couple of years since when you consider the minimum wage and health care and whatnot. And I know you mentioned earlier on the call that investing in your people and at the Analyst Day you talked about perhaps adding a layer of management for additional oversight of each of the core brands. Just wondering if you can talk to us about the cost-saving opportunity see on the labor line to mitigate that? I know you've been good in terms of laying out kind of your annual cost-saving targets and whatnot. But specific to that labor line, do you have things that you think could help mitigate and offset and kind of where are they in terms of their rollout?","C. Bradford Richmond","Jeff, this is Brad. I'll start off with this. We did talk about at the conference about additional opportunities in labor optimization in terms of our transformational opportunities and so there will be some opportunity to work on that. I think if you look back on a quarterly basis, we have done quite well on managing and leveraging our restaurant labor. I think more what you're seeing this year is -- excuse me, in this quarter is the sales deleveraging impact and Drew has talked some about of that. But we also had a increase, which was more temporary in nature in our group insurance claims partially as we're rolling off the self-insurance that we've had in the prior years. With this year, we've moved to the corporate exchange. So there's a little bit of noise in the third quarter number.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then just from a follow-up perspective in terms of the comps. We've talked about the spike in gas and the delayed tax refunds, which would seem temporary in nature relative to the structural impact from higher employment tax. When you think about those 3 things in terms of the extreme volatility we've seen recently, how much do you attribute, I guess, to the structural one, which is the higher employment tax. Or maybe said another way, I mean, if you look back how much of a benefit did you get and over how long did you benefit when the rate was lowered 2 years ago to kind of see what kind of the reversion might be?","Clarence Otis","Yes. I don't think we have any way of really knowing that because there's so many other variables in that environment what it was lowered and in this environment where it's been raised. On the delayed refund side, we have no visibility to that dynamic. We listen very closely to people who do. So Wal-Mart has talked extensively about it. They have pretty good visibility because they cash a lot of refund checks and they contract what they've cashed this year against what they cashed last year and the various patterns. And it seems to have amounted to a decent amount of money inside their system. And of course, they're only a fraction of the entire system. And so we think that, that probably had an effect on February, but all we can go by is what we read from others who have more visibility on it.","Operator","Our next question from Matthew DiFrisco from Lazard.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I just wondered, Clarence, if you can just sort of follow up on that. As far as a regional basis, there's been a lot of differences as far as reports we see with employment data, housing market data and certainly weather impacts. Can you give us from either a broad perspective of your portfolio or an industry perspective what you're seeing in the same-store sales trends if there's a certain regional differences or any sort of correlations with those economic catalysts or weather roadblocks?","Clarence Otis","Well, we certainly have the weather differences and we see those pretty clearly. So we had significant weather in December and February and it was pretty localized Midwest and Northeast mostly. But in terms of the non-weather macroeconomic portions, Brad?","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, I've got a little bit of information there. I think if you look at a sequential basis where we're seeing the weakness really is in that South Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic area. That's kind of lagging the other areas. When you look at on a year-over-year basis, it's those same areas that are lagging a little bit. And I think as Clarence said he had stripped out the weather, maybe a little bit of weakness in that upper Midwest, but it's not too significant. So I'd say none of them are really striking differences when you look at across all of our brands other than maybe a tad, like I said, in that South Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic region.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And then, I guess, just as a follow-up, you mentioned in the month of March and you referred to Malcolm Knapp's comments yesterday about sort of the improvement that he was citing from February to step up improvement. I guess, both you -- the industry and your brands have significantly easier year ago comparisons ahead. I guess, is that a comment on business strength and momentum as we look at it as far as sometimes if you talk about the 2-year comp trend showing a uptick, or are you just basically seeing what we'd expect to see the benefit of softer year ago comparisons also would bring about a 1-year improvement?","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, I think we tried to make some adjustments on a year-over-year basis. So for example, February last year had a huge weather positive and so we don't have the weather number in March, and so we're looking at all of those different variables. So if you look at February a year ago, it was up 30%. And so on a 2-year basis, I guess you're talking about roughly 2.5% down in February last year whereas March last year was up, I think, KNAPP-TRACK was about 1 point. And so March was a tougher month than February and we're seeing improvement in March. So it's not the 2-year stuff that's going on. I think February just had, beyond weather, a couple of jolts that consumers took some time to adjust to.","Operator","Our next question, Jason West with Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Drew, earlier you mentioned that some of the investments in check were a little more significant than you expected and you'd made some learnings around that. Are you referring to something that happened earlier on in the quarter kind of before you updated guidance or some things that happened kind of later on in February, if you could just talk a bit more kind of what those issues were and what kind of changes you're making.","Andrew H. Madsen","It was really what occurred throughout the quarter, and probably the biggest thing that we've learned is the percent of guests that were ordering these dishes, which had a bigger impact than we thought. And it also had an impact on appetizer add-ons. Those are probably the 2 biggest things that we learned and those are the areas that we're going to be looking at refining as we go forward.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you mean the promotional items and the appetizers were higher preference than kind of you expected and that put some downward pressure on check?","Andrew H. Madsen","The promotional items, yes, not the appetizers.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then I've seen recently a little more what seems like more couponing around some of the deal such as Lobsterfest coming through places like Twitter. I don't know if that's something new or if that's sort of what you were doing last year, but if you could talk about sort of that couponing effort or sort of BOGO effort, if that's significant driver, if it's something that impacts check, that's helped traffic or maybe it's just sort of more what you've always been doing.","Andrew H. Madsen","Lobsterfest is a promotion we believe in. We think it's a very distinctive brand, defining an offer that you can't get anywhere else. And there are a lot of guests that are very excited about Lobsterfest and willing to pay a premium price for very distinctive, crave-able dishes. There are other guests who are a little more aspirational and would love to come if it were a bit more affordable and those are the guests this year that we made some tactical adjustments to try and give them more -- a little bit more of a affordability incentive to come in for a great experience during Lobsterfest.","Operator","Our next question from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just taking a step back a little bit. At the Analyst Day, there was a lot of discussion about what you get and what you pay, I guess meaning that it takes both to win market share in the current environment. So I guess I'm pretty clear on what you mean on the pay side of the equation. But what are some of the near-term changes you can make with the what you get both at Olive Garden and Red Lobster? What can you do in the near term to help sort of drive top line using that side of the equation?","Andrew H. Madsen","Yes, that is exactly what we were talking about at the Analyst Day, in particular about Olive Garden. So beyond affordability, we know that there's different guests that have different needs. And one of the biggest needs at Olive Garden beyond affordability is the opportunity to have experience that's a little lighter and a little fresher. And that's why we introduced the lighter Italian fare section recently and we've seen a very good response to that core menu section. It's also why we introduced some new lunch items at Olive Garden, more daypart appropriate menus, Italian sandwiches and some new calzones, and we've seen a very positive response there as well. The biggest opportunity we have beyond affordability at Red Lobster is the veto vote where not everyone in the party wants a seafood item and that's why they were very focused on that in their core menu introduction back late September, early October. And we've seen, not only an increase in the number of people buying their new mainstay dishes that are under $15, we've also seen an even bigger percentage increase in guests who were buying the new non-seafood items at Red Lobster. So those are some of the things that we're focused on.","Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then just one quick follow-up. I've been listening to a lot of your responses to some of these questions. And just looking out to FY '14 as it relates to sort of the promotional strategy. Is it fair to think or assume that we're going to see several quarters of continued negative mix numbers as we get into FY '14 at both Olive Garden and Red Lobster, is that a fair assumption?","Andrew H. Madsen","We'll talk about FY '14, I guess, in June.","Operator","Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Had a question regarding operating cash flow for fiscal '14, just given your commentary at the Analyst Day and how we should think about that number. Just with the backdrop of your guidance you've already talked about for roughly flat earnings growth for next year and what looks like on the operating cash flow line roughly $90 million or so benefit on the balance sheet that's going to help you get to that, call it, $955 million in operating cash flow for this year, just wondering what that trajectory might look like as we carry on into fiscal '14.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, I think from where we're stepping off in fiscal '13 you're going to see it modestly grow from there one from the operating side with what we've talked about on our expected performance. Also, as well, some of the other items that go into that around working capital, the progress there. So at this early juncture, I think you're going to see it move modestly up from there into fiscal '14.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, and just a quick follow-up there. Wanted to get your thoughts on what has been impacting same-store sales when talking about a number of things. But now that we're through the quarter and into March, I know it's difficult to do but wondering kind of how you think weather compares might have impacted that potentially more so than we initially thought where people have talked about payroll tax increases, delayed refund checks, et cetera. And now that we're into March and we're seeing this fairly dramatic improvement, where we may be discounting the weather impact a little bit more so than we should have.","Clarence Otis","Well, I mean, February was a month that had decent weather effect year-over-year. So 130, 150 basis points, I think, we've said. But much of that is really because February a year ago was so mild. I mean, this February is fairly typical winter. March, I don't know. I mean, I don't get the sense that it's a particularly severe month. And March a year ago was not a particularly severe month either.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, Will. This is Brad. We've took a similar convention of looking at the weather impacts and really weather impact for us is precipitation is the big one for us, so snow or ice is what really has the impact, not so much the temperature side. And I think last year, we talked about a pretty big lift in last year's number. I believe, for the quarter it's about 200 basis points, so we're wrapping over a pretty big lift. That same analytical convention that got that number -- gave us the numbers this year that Clarence has talked about with about 110 basis points of impact in December, really nothing in January and 150 in February. So I don't think there's a much in the weather per se other than what we've detailed that's impacting the business.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And by saying, it was March a big change in weather?","C. Bradford Richmond","Not so far. I mean, we did have -- we always seem to have one late storm that comes during March. It varies from week-to-week, but nothing that seems unusual at this point.","Operator","Our next question from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","There's got to be a silver lining somewhere here. I was wondering could you please talk about the higher-end brands? Talk to us about either SRG in total or pieces and I'm mostly curious about how did they weather the impact of -- basically, did it look different than your core brands in terms of the things that slowed you down or tripped you up so far year-to-date?","Clarence Otis","Yes, yes, before I turn it over to Gene, I mean, one of the highest priority we've got right now at our larger brands is regaining traffic momentum. And so same-restaurant traffic negative this quarter, a lot more negative than what we like. But after trailing the industry for each of the prior 3 quarters, matching it on same-restaurant traffic was, we think, important. And we would expect to establish a positive gap to the industry on traffic as we go forward. That's our objective. So we think we saw some progress there. I'll turn it over to Gene.","Eugene I. Lee","Thanks, Clarence. Nicole, let me just -- I'll comment on Capital Grille because it's the largest brand inside the group and had the strongest quarter. And as we said at the Analyst Day, the environment is very positive for the group. We've seeing strong business travel. We're seeing luxury growth in other aspects, in retail, in hotel. We had a very strong holiday season with private dining. We also believe in Capital Grille. One of the reasons for the strength throughout the quarter is that we're adapting to the new world of online reservations. We believe we're getting much better at dealing with OpenTable and allowing access to our restaurant. I think we're a little slow to react to that trend, but we are getting much better there. We're working on that also at Eddie V's. We think that's the key going forward as people continue to change the way they book in fine dining. So we had a very, very strong quarter. We're seeing a lot of growth in our restaurants that have been opened 3 to 4, 5 years ago where we have some capacity opportunities and performed pretty well. Seasons had a decent quarter. We got back to the positive side of the ledger and they had also had a great quarter with private dining. So overall, I think our business continues to remain strong. The environment is strong for us. We've done a lot of great work from a culinary standpoint. We're in a good place with our service platforms and we think we're positioned to continue to grow into the future.","Operator","We have a question from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just wanted to step back and ask kind of a broader question on you've talked about some of the strategic maybe missteps, but now going forward, corrections that you're making around check and menu offering. Can you just talk a little bit about the idea that some of the varied menu competitors out there have really broadened their menu to include a lot of offerings that might be similar to what you have. And so, I guess, the question is, generally, is there any limitation because you have sort of these more single and focused concept brands? And maybe another way to ask that question is just can you tell where your customers have been going in lieu of the Darden brands?","Clarence Otis","Yes, I would say that I think we talked about a lot of it at the Analyst Meeting. So the attrition that we've seen is really on the lower end of the household income continuum. So a lot of those folks have really traded out of dining out because they're that financially constrained. So their visit frequency overall is down. Some have traded to lower check within casual dining, lower check brands, and some have traded from casual dining to lower-check segments. And so that's really -- because we're talking about attrition at the margin and that is what we're seeing. We're not seeing a whole lot of change in the rest of the income continuum. We're certainly not seeing attrition there. So...","Andrew H. Madsen","The only thing I would add to that is we believe that we can make our brands more relevant and remain broadly appealing, recapture guests without becoming a varied menu brand and without losing brand distinctiveness. So that's why I mentioned at Olive Garden we're focused so much on beyond affordability on lighter, fresher fare. That's why at LongHorn, we're focused, in particular, on steak distinctiveness and really establishing that brand as the best casual dining steakhouse in the segment introducing things like the 30-ounce porterhouse or the new Rancher\u2019s Sirloin. So we don't believe we need to become a varied menu. We need to remain distinctive and just understand the need states that we need to become more relevant in.","Clarence Otis","And I would say that as we look at it and we think about national casual dining brands, those that are distinct and differentiated enjoy the highest unit volumes and so that speaks to the importance of not being sort of varied menu. The varied menu brands have unit volumes that essentially range from $2.2 million to $3 million, and LongHorn is at the bottom of our list at $3 million but they don't advertise anywhere near where the rest of the national brands are because they're not national yet. And Olive Garden, Red Lobster are dramatically higher than that. So is Outback, so is Texas Roadhouse. And so the people who are differentiated and are viewed as varied menu didn't have the strongest competitive positions.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, I think that makes sense. I just -- I'm trying to figure out if your lagging the industry, then presumably either you're losing more customers than other people are or you're losing customers to other restaurants. It sounds like to the extent that, that's happening it's more just potentially lower income consumers trading down to...","Clarence Otis","Yes, I mean, that's really at the bottom end. The players that have the higher unit volumes tend to have the higher checks. And that's -- yes, and we're pretty well developed there. And yes, so we think it really is -- that's really the affordability question we're talking about. And the reason why we have to be pretty targeted with it because we've got a lot of other guests, affordability is important but it's not their highest priority. Their highest priority is high quality.","Operator","Our last question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Amod Gautam filling in. First, I'd like to give around color around same-store sales expectations as 1% to 2% annually in the near term. I think, specifically there was a traffic expectation of 0% to 1%. And I know maybe a few years ago, you were outperforming the industry by up to 300 basis points. And obviously, that's converged more recently. So within that flat to 1% expectation, where do you think the industry kind of flushes out? And is there a sort of an implicit assumption that Darden will outperform?","Clarence Otis","I mean, the industry's been negative same-restaurant sales. I forget how negative. So any positive would be outperformance. That is the expectation. And we talked about that means not only so winning the day-to-day market share contest within casual dining, but making sure that we win the sort of larger battle within the entire dining out spectrum.","Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just trying to get a sense for kind of the puts and takes within the new unit CapEx for the next few years. How many units of the LongHorns and Olive Gardens that you're expected to open annually in the near term or kind of committed in fiscal 2014 and then 2015 maybe?","Andrew H. Madsen","Yes, I would say at this point in the juncture, we've shared what 2014 looks like at the conference. I'd say, 2015, with what we know today and what our expectations are, will be much similar to 2014. We have lots of opportunity with a strong performance in SRG. If anything, within the deployment for new restaurants, you might see a little bit more going to SRG just given their strong performance.","Matthew Stroud","We'd like to thank everybody that joined us on the call today. We recognize that there are a few more folks in queue. We apologize we couldn't get to you this morning. We will be happy to take your calls, of course, here in Orlando. We thank everybody for their participation, and we look forward to speaking with you in June.","Operator","Today's conference has concluded. Participants may disconnect at this time.

While I have had the privilege of speaking with many of you during the past several weeks, I wanted to take a brief moment to introduce myself. My name is Rick Cardenas, and I\u2019m the SVP of finance, strategy, and technology, and a large part of my role is leading our investor relations outreach.","We welcome those of you joining us today by telephone or the internet, and I look forward to working with everyone in the analyst and investment community. With me today is Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s interim CEO, and Brad Richmond, Darden\u2019s CFO.","Following prepared remarks from Gene and Brad, we will take your questions. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections.","Those risks are described in the company\u2019s earnings press release, which was distributed earlier today, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s discussion and presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. A reconciliation of these measurements is in our press release.","In addition, we have also posted a few slides on our website under the \u201cinvestors\u201d tab that provide an overview of our first half financial results, a reconciliation of adjustments to second quarter earnings, and our fiscal 2015 outlook.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gene.","Eugene Lee","Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report improved performance in our business in the second quarter. Brad will provide more financial details in a moment, but at a high level, total sales from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.56 billion, a 4.9% increase from the second quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, our earnings per share were $0.28, which represents a 133% increase year over year.","Olive Garden had same restaurant sales of positive 0.5%, the first positive quarter for the brand since the quarter ended May 2013. Longhorn Steakhouse continued to deliver strong same restaurant sales growth with an increase of 2.6%. We also saw continued gains in our specialty restaurant group, which delivered a 3.2% increase in same restaurant sales on a blended basis.","I want to take the time now to do two things: provide an update on our go-forward strategy and discuss key highlights from operating performance in the quarter. Let\u2019s start with an update on our strategy.","First, we believe our future success needs to start with our ability to improve same restaurant sales, resulting in increased market share and achieving best-in-class profitability. In order to achieve these goals and win in the marketplace, we are getting back to basics by increasing our focus on the core operational fundamentals of the business.","In particular, this means providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in great food, with terrific service, all delivered in an appealing atmosphere. We are working hard to improve excellence in each of these areas to provide an outstanding guest experience and once again achieve industry-leading and sustainable same restaurant sales growth.","Winning in the restaurants must be supported by a guest focused support structure across our field leadership and our restaurant support center. As you know, we announced some difficult but necessary decisions last month that made our support structure more efficient, both in terms of cost and decision making.","Beyond our organization structure, we are pursuing other significant non-consumer-facing cost savings initiatives. We have recently engaged with Boston Consulting Group to help with the process and are encouraged by the opportunities identified. We expect to see meaningful benefits in fiscal 2016 and will have more detail to share in the quarters ahead.","In parallel, with our focus on operations, the board and the management team also have the responsibility to ensure we\u2019re maximizing every element of our business in order to drive shareholder value. Our initial focus will be exploring options for our real estate portfolio, which includes more than 1,200 owned or ground leased properties across the country.","We want to be comprehensive and thoughtful in considering the options to ensure we\u2019re maximizing shareholder value while also maintaining the best structure for our ongoing business. There are a number of options. To assist us with this comprehensive analysis, we are engaging advisors with extensive expertise in these types of valuations, including JPMorgan, Moelis & Company, and Skadden & Arps.","The board and management team will also continue to evaluate other strategies, including franchising and the composition of our brand portfolio. However, real estate will be the first area of focus. Of course, there are no assurances we\u2019ll ultimately pursue any of these options. While we do not have a set timeline or additional details to disclose now, we plan to provide updates if and when appropriate.","Lastly, a clear priority for the board is the selection of our next CEO. The board is actively engaged in the search process.","Now let\u2019s turn to some highlights on our performance in the quarter. At Olive Garden, we have now had four straight months of positive same restaurant sales, the first time this has happened since November of 2010. We believe these results are early signs that our brand renaissance plan is beginning to take hold.","Key consumer metrics on overall experience, quality of food, taste, value, and attentive service continue to trend in the right direction. Olive Garden\u2019s to-go business continues to experience significant growth, with sales in the quarter up over 15% versus last year.","As we have discussed before, this is driven in large part to our online ordering platform, which we launched in July. We experienced an additional increase following the introduction of mobile ordering on November 3, and we now have more than 30,000 online orders coming in every week.","This growth is very important as the check average is 30% higher when guests order online. Takeout represents 8.6% of our total sales. Given the increasing trend for convenience, we believe we can drive takeout sales above 12% over time.","We have now completed 13 remodels, all with various investment levels and the results so far have been encouraging. Before proceeding with a meaningful capital investment, we will continue to evaluate the performance of these locations over a longer period of time.","We believe opportunity exists to optimize the investment level to improve our returns. Therefore, we are deferring additional remodels for the rest of the fiscal year as we continue to evaluate our options.","The progress at Olive Garden is really beginning to show, not just in response from our guests, but also in the way our managers and team members have embraced the brand renaissance and are leading the charge in the field. While there is much more we have to do, we definitely feel that we\u2019re moving in the right direction.","Longhorn Steakhouse\u2019s same restaurant sales increased 2.6% for the quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth and industry outperformance. The same restaurant sales growth this quarter was driven by check growth, due primarily to the launch of Bold Bites in June. Bold Bites are smaller, individually portioned appetizers designed to satisfy guests seeking more choice on portion and flavor.","While our core focus is to continue to offer great steaks, we introduced a new menu this quarter that expanded our variety beyond steak. This menu received positive feedback from both our operators and our guests.","At Longhorn, we\u2019re also focused on elevating our guest experience and improving service through more consistent execution of our current standards, and our guest satisfaction scores show that we\u2019re at all-time highs for numerous key attributes, including food taste, server attentiveness, server knowledge, and value for money. The combination of disciplined operational execution and compelling marketing has driven our growth at Longhorn, which we expect to continue on both the top and bottom line.","The Capital Grille recorded its 19th consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth. The brand continues to outperform the competitive set and its operating profit was higher than last year, despite high beef inflation.","In October, the Capital Grille will launch the iPad wine list systemwide. This change enhances the guest experience, captures incremental sales, and provides us with the flexibility to adjust offerings more frequently.","The Yard House had same restaurant sales of 3.7%, which was 250 basis points above the industry average. Including the addition of eight new restaurants, total sales growth was 16.2% and total profits increased year over year.","The Yard House accomplished a lot during the quarter. The brand launched a one-page all-day menu, along with an independent drink menu that is easier to navigate. These changes had a positive impact on sales and margins. The Yard House also expanded afternoon and late night happy hour beverage offerings to include all spirits, a strategy designed to broaden the appeal of these day parts.","The Seasons 52 team is working hard on every area of the guest experience. Their brand returned a positive same-store sales this quarter. However, total profit was down on a year over year basis.","This was due in large part to the underperformance in newer nontraditional restaurants such as those in central business districts. We have learned from these restaurants and are encouraged by the results of our most recent openings, which are in suburban locations where the brand continues to be successful.","Same restaurant sales at Bahama Breeze were slightly negative, while profits were slightly positive. The team is working through several profitable sales driving strategies for the second half of the year.","In Eddie V\u2019s, same restaurant sales exceeded the industry and operating profit was up versus last year. And we are very pleased with the results and progress.","Now, Brad will provide us with more detail regarding our financials. Brad?","C. Bradford Richmond","Thank you, Gene, and good afternoon everybody. As we reported earlier today, on an adjusted basis, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the fiscal second quarter was $0.28, a 133% increase from the adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter last year. On a reported basis, our net loss per diluted share was $0.24.","The adjusted results exclude approximately $0.52 per share, of which $0.33 were noncash items. The breakout of the $0.52 includes $0.16 related to asset impairments at eleven restaurants and lease buyouts of two properties, $0.16 of severance and other costs associated with the support expense reduction efforts announced in November, $0.08 of cost associated with the strategic action plan, $0.07 for the impairment and related tax effects of [unintelligible] agriculture investment, $0.05 of debt breakage costs related to the previously planned retirement of $100 million of the company\u2019s debt.","Now, page five on our web-based presentation provides the impact of these adjustments on a P&L line item basis. We will continue to operate the impaired restaurants. We will evaluate any potential future closure to optimize the value-creating opportunity as it arises.","Now, second quarter sales from continuing operations increased 4.9% to $1.56 billion, from blended same restaurant sales increase of 1.5% and the addition of 52 net new restaurants. Food and beverage expenses were approximately 100 basis points higher than last year.","The unfavorable cost increase was driven entirely by higher beef and dairy cost on a year over year basis. The elevated dairy cost fully accounts for the decline in Olive Garden\u2019s quarterly profits.","Restaurant labor expenses were approximately 60 basis points lower than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to direct labor hour management, sales leveraging, and lower year over year restaurant manager incentive compensation. Restaurant expenses in the quarter were approximately 20 basis points higher than last year, principally due to higher rent.","Excluding the adjustments previously noted in both years, selling, general, and administrative expenses were approximately 140 basis points lower on a percentage of sales basis, due to the impact of the cost reduction initiatives we undertaken in the past year and leveraging of our sales increase.","We anticipate the general and administrative portion of these expenses, as a percentage of sales, to be below 5% for the entire fiscal year now. And, in total, in spite of the significant commodity pressures, EBIT margins improved 80 basis points versus last year for the current quarter.","We retired $100 million in debt in the second quarter, which brings our total debt reduction to $1 billion for the fiscal year. Our reduced debt levels contributed to lower interest expense of approximately $13 million in the second quarter and we expect a $30 million reduction for the current fiscal year. The annualized reduction we anticipate to be $49 million.","Our tax rate for the quarter reflects a 19% rate on our continuing operations before adjustments. Because of the discrete accounting treatment of many of the adjustment items, our total tax rate on the reported quarter loss was 44%. Excluding the adjustments, our annual effective tax rate is expected to be closer to 20%.","We estimate our annual effective tax rate on a reported basis will be a credit rate of approximately 5%, driven by the loss attributable to the earnings per share adjustments I previously detailed.","During the second quarter, we took delivery of over 8.6 million shares of stock under our previously announced accelerated share repurchase authorization. This contributed $0.01 to second quarter EPS, which is consistent with our previous expectations and is expected to have a positive impact of $0.11 on the fiscal 2015 EPS. The annualized impact of the $500 million accelerated share repurchase is anticipated to be approximately $0.17.","Now, turning to our commodity cost outlook, food cost inflation in the second quarter net of our cost savings efforts was approximately 4.3%, driven by beef and dairy inflation. In the fiscal year, our current expectation is that our commodity basket will see net inflation of approximately 3%, which is higher than the 2% to 2.5% we communicated in September.","Now, with this, this implies a 2% to 2.5% inflation rate for the second half of our fiscal year. That\u2019s up from our previous expectation of approximately 1% for that same period.","Looking at it category by category, for the remainder of fiscal 2015, beef costs are higher on a year over year basis, with 15% of our usage covered. [Seafood] costs are lower on a year over year basis, with 90% of our usage covered. Poultry costs are higher on a year over year basis, with 70% of our usage covered. Wheat costs are higher on a year over year basis, with two-thirds of our usage covered. And dairy costs are higher on a year over year basis, with approximately one-fourth of our usage covered.","This is approximately the same total coverage that we had at this point last year, but with less coverage in beef and dairy, because we expect market prices to be lower than what we could have previously contracted for.","Now let\u2019s turn to our guidance for the full fiscal year. We expect same restaurant sales growth for Olive Garden to be even to plus 1% to last year, Longhorn Steakhouse to be approximately 2% to 3% above last year, and our specialty restaurants also to be up approximately 2% to 3%.","We continue to expect to open approximately 37 net new restaurants for the fiscal year. I should point out that there are some key drivers of the significant EPS growth that we have anticipated in the second half of the year, and they\u2019re detailed on the bottom of page six in our presentation, but I want to highlight that they really include the general business improvement that we\u2019re seeing, including the lap on last year\u2019s severe winter weather, the benefits of our debt reduction, the benefits of the accelerated share repurchase program, and the fact that this year contains an extra, or 53rd, week.","We anticipate adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $2.25 and $2.30 for fiscal 2015. On an unadjusted basis, or reported basis, we anticipate net diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.30 to $1.35 for the year.","Consistent with our commitment to maximize free cash flow, we are also lowering our projected fiscal 2015 capital expenditures. This reduction is from the plan to [unintelligible] evaluating the results and the spending level of the Olive Garden remodel program and more broadly, a greater focus on capital spending. We expect to finish the year a little over $300 million compared to the $325 million to $350 million previously communicated.","In the second half of the year, we will continue our share repurchases of up to $200 million, funded with our free cash flow.","Before we take your questions, Gene has a few closing comments. Gene?","Eugene Lee","Thanks, Brad. Let me conclude our prepared remarks with a few additional thoughts about the past several months and the progress we have been making across our business. First, I\u2019d like to acknowledge that this is our first earnings call since the election of our new board of directors. Our board has been engaged in the business from day one, and the management team and the board are working well together in order to ensure we have the right strategy to drive long term value creation for our shareholders.","This change has brought about a positive energy across the company that extends from our management team, all the way to our restaurants. Our teams are excited about our sharpened focus on restaurant operations, and we\u2019re all motivated to build on the momentum in the business both on the top and bottom line.","Second, we are pleased with the early indicators that our strategic initiatives are driving improved operating performance. These initiatives are not a quick fix, but rather a journey designed to strengthen the most important elements of our business: improving the quality of our food and the service we provide to our guests.","There\u2019s still a long way to go, and we are committed and excited to continue to drive toward reaching our full potential. We believe the strong foundation we have laid across all of our brands during the past year will help us to continue to improve sales and earnings growth during the back half of this fiscal year and into fiscal 2016.","Finally, I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their dedication in providing a great experience for our guests. This has not been an ordinary year for Darden, yet despite all the noise and potential for distractions, our restaurant teams are as focused as I\u2019ve ever seen them. Their efforts are an integral part of our positive results this quarter and our employees should be very proud of the progress we\u2019ve achieved.","With that, we\u2019ll open up the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And our first question comes from Mr. Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer","I recognize it\u2019s still very early, but just going back to some of the marketing and advertising savings that [unintelligible] had pointed to several months ago, I\u2019m just curious if the new board has had a chance to look at some of the media efficiencies, the effectiveness of the current game plan. I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s any early updated thinking on potentially what a new marketing strategy would be moving forward.","Eugene Lee","We continue to look at our marketing strategy and becoming as efficient as we possibly can. When we think about how we spend our marketing dollars, especially in the large brands, we look at Olive Garden, and as our primary message on television, our secondary message on television, and then our third, which is our lunch messaging on television. Then we have digital, and then we have some local messaging after that.","Right now, what we\u2019re focused on is optimizing the right mix between promotional, secondary, which is more brand, and then lunch. And we\u2019ve moved to approximately 25% of our spend to be digital, and we believe that we\u2019ve been able to, and we will reduce some of our working media. But our real focus from a savings standpoint right now is to continue to reduce our non-working media.","We have also engaged A&M to come in and work with the Olive Garden management team to do a comprehensive review of the go-to-market strategy, how we develop products, how we bring them to life, how we then advertise, and how we spend all our advertising dollars, and what is the right mix.","And so this has been a project that we\u2019ve been working on for some time, and we continue to change the media mix each and every quarter to try to optimize it. We have some really good diagnostics that provide great analysis for us, and we think that we\u2019re doing a much better job with that over the last nine months or so.","Operator","Next we have Mr. Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Gene, thinking about the broader industry, perhaps, just wondering if you can talk about your confidence about the most recent uptick, one, in the industry is sustainable and maybe the key drivers you think have led to that. And how do you decipher between the broader improvement in the macro relative to the Olive Garden\u2019s specific initiatives. Just seems like it would be difficult to decipher if your initiatives are actually working versus the macro. And just maybe as a follow up, if you could just prioritize what you think are Olive Garden\u2019s significant initiatives that you think would be the most compelling or effective that have driven the improvement.","Eugene Lee ","I think I\u2019d start with saying that Olive Garden\u2019s performance against the industry in November actually significantly improved, where we beat the industry both on guest count and on a sales basis. The comment that the overall industry has picked up, that\u2019s not what November Knapp-Track is saying. November Knapp-Track actually was weaker than October. We\u2019re actually seeing some deceleration in casual dining.","And so I\u2019m very pleased that Olive Garden performed as well as it did, and moved ahead of the industry in November, with pretty much a straight-up comparison. It wasn\u2019t like the prior months, where we were moving Neverending Pasta Bowl. We slid that back, so that messed a little bit with the comparisons.","So when I look at the improvement that I think we\u2019re seeing in Olive Garden, it has more to do with us gaining against the industry versus a situation where we have a rising tide and all boats are being lifted.","Jeffrey Bernstein","And you think, if you prioritized those initiatives that you think Olive Garden\u2019s already put in place, is there a couple that you\u2019d say these are having an immediate impact, and that you think is a driver of that narrowing of the gap, or reversing of that gap?","Eugene Lee ","Yeah, I\u2019m going to point to two, I think, very important things. Number one was the commitment to put a 999 price point on the menu with everyday value. And so the preference on that item continues to grow. And what that is enabling Dave and the team to do is to pull back on the promotional intensity of their messaging and the pricing of those promotions. And we believe that is a real key to driving long term success.","The second piece that I believe is really important in the Olive Garden momentum is to-go. To-go, we defined that as an important opportunity. We put resources behind it. Quickly enabled us to get to online ordering, and we\u2019re seeing that business grow at 15%.","And this is driven by a consumer need state of convenience. Consumers want convenience. Olive Garden has great food that travels very, very well, and we believe we\u2019re delivering on that consumer need state extremely well, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re experiencing this kind of growth in takeout.","So those two things, everyday value, not having to rely on our promotional activity, be such a deep discount, and then to-go, I think is really driving some positive momentum in the business.","Operator","Next we have Mr. Howard Penney with Hedgeye Risk Management.","Howard Penney","My question is on the Olive Garden, and in the first quarter, you specifically called out how well the Olive Garden was doing in the press release. And then in the second quarter, you didn\u2019t, and you didn\u2019t mention the renaissance plan as well. And now the remodels don\u2019t sound like they\u2019re going too well and\/or they might be too expensive. So without a remodel program, can you talk to the extent to which you can actually improve the Olive Garden and the renaissance plan without improving the asset base?","Eugene Lee ","Let me clarify a couple of thoughts around the remodel plan, and then I\u2019ll get back to the essence of your question. We are very pleased with the initial results of the remodels. What we\u2019re having difficulty reading is what level of investment is necessary to create the highest return on that invested capital. We know the key to remodeling an Olive Garden is for the team to figure out how to add between 20 and 28 seats in each of the buildings. That\u2019s an important part.","And so that\u2019s kind of a given in a remodel package. From there, how do we best utilize the dollars that we have available and what\u2019s the right investment level? And that\u2019s why we\u2019re pausing, because we don\u2019t have a long enough time at this point in time to read the different investments that we have out there. But I do believe going forward as we move into \u201916, we will have to refresh some of these older buildings.","On the overall confidence on the business, I believe that the four pillars that we\u2019ve been talking about are key. The first is around menu. We have to continue to deliver everyday value, choice and variety, and convenience. And I think we\u2019re doing a very good job on all three of those things, but there\u2019s still work to be done. We know that we have to simplify the menu to increase our speed of service, improve our quality.","So although we\u2019ve made some very good first steps, work to be done. We know from an operations standpoint, we can improve our service. And if we can improve our service, we know we can improve the frequency of our guests.","Third is communication. We have to improve how we communicate with our guests, with the voice in which we communicate. So we\u2019ve got to improve our television advertising, we think there\u2019s some things that we can do from a digital standpoint. And one of our big upsides with our very large database is to refine our customer relationship management and really work to develop the appropriate loyalty program that will make people choose Olive Garden over other competitors.","The fourth piece of the pillar has been about the remodel and the touchpoints, and there are a lot of other things that we can do inside these restaurants to improve the overall atmosphere that don\u2019t mean changing the sticks and bricks. But there are things like uniforms, plate ware, flatware, music, things like that, that can really improve the overall atmosphere, that we\u2019re working on, we\u2019re implementing those changes. And we believe that if we combine all those together, that we\u2019ll have a business that has a compelling value proposition that will continue to grow over time.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company.","Brian Bittner","I have two questions. The first question is on the earnings outlook. Can you just walk us through what exactly drove the increase in the midpoint of the guide? I know it was a small increase, but it still, I think, highlights the confidence you guys have in the rest of the year. So are you more comfortable with just the cadence of comps, or is it being driven by what you\u2019re doing on the G&A line? If you could just first walk us through those dynamics, I\u2019d appreciate it.","Bradford Richmond","We provided some supplemental information with our website, and we detail some of these key drivers for us. Many of those are in place. So the debt paydown has reduced interest impact. I think I said $30 million in my prepared comments for the year, I should have said $38 million. But you can see that that adds roughly $0.18 in EPS. You can look at the share repurchase program that we\u2019ve done. That\u2019s about $0.09 for us. Then with the 53rd week it\u2019s $0.05.","So the remaining $0.22 to $0.27 is really driven by the business improvement, which is the same restaurant sales performance that we\u2019ve talked about, many of these cost initiatives. We ended the second quarter at the high end of what we had expected. We finished the first half of the year with a 26% increase in adjusted EPS to last year.","Our guidance suggests a 34% to 38% increase in the back half of the year, and obviously that step up is driven by the larger impact from the debt paydown and share repurchase, and obviously all the 53rd week. But the core business itself is supported by the comp range that we\u2019ve been talking about for Olive Garden at flat to 1%, as well as the 2% to 3% for both the Longhorn and specialty restaurants.","So that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve baked into that. I think a key assumption to point out is the impact of adverse weather mainly in the third quarter, first part of fourth quarter. And last year was a very severe impact to us, the geographical area hit us where we had the biggest concentration of restaurants and hit us more on the weekends. So we\u2019re obviously hoping that\u2019s not the case this year.","Our guidance is built on what we call a normalized or rolling five-year average, and so we do expect some improvement from that, but we just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to predict that one, and we\u2019ll hope for the best weather, and if we can be on the good side of that, we\u2019ll have more earnings.","If it turns out to be similar to last year, that will put downward pressure on us. But we believe, when you look in totality, all the moving parts, if you will, in building the estimate, that the range that we\u2019ve suggested gives us ample room to land somewhere in between there.","Brian Bittner ","When I look at the guidance for Olive Garden comps, it does imply about 1% to 2% in the second half, but obviously what jumps out, I think, to everyone, is the fact that you\u2019re facing comparisons there, weather-driven comparisons at Olive Garden this quarter, that are almost 500 basis points easier. And the industry obviously does face much easier comparisons as well.","And again, I know you\u2019re impacted by weather, but how should we think about the cadence of these sales if weather is normalized? Can we think about two-year trends here holding? Is that too ambitious? Or under normalized weather, how can we think about that going forward over these next two quarters of really easy comparisons?","Bradford Richmond ","The best way I would define that is with the guidance of flat to 1% for the year, they need to be at about plus 0.5% to plus 1.5%. They\u2019re stepping out of the second quarter being up 0.5%, and so maintaining that run rate is what we have in there, and then a little bit of lift from the weather. If we make further progress in that business than what we\u2019re anticipating, we know how our business model reacts, and there\u2019s strong flow through on the incremental sales.","So to the degree, to your point, if weather and other things work better, I\u2019m confident that our model will deliver high end of this range, and if the weather\u2019s really good, or we make further progress, potentially above it. But I don\u2019t think, where we are today, that that\u2019s the best communication we can say, that it\u2019s anything above or below that range. It\u2019s our best knowledge of all those pieces today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Buckingham Research.","Matt DiFrisco","I just wanted to switch gears a little bit on the assessment of the real estate portfolio and the stores of the Olive Garden brand. You guys were growing through the beginning of the recession, so if I look back sort of from - the Olive Garden brand has expanded almost 200 stores from 2007 to now. Are we completely done with the process of assessing potential closures of the stores?","I know with the new board and everything, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of process going on as far as looking at the portfolio and the stores. Are there stores that might be underperforming that could be either relocated or closed down and benefit neighboring stores? I\u2019m just wondering, has there been a study as far as the saturation and the quality of the stores, if there\u2019s a benefit from closures.","Bradford Richmond ","We have a fairly robust and ongoing evaluation of our restaurant portfolio, and in particular with Olive Garden, it has expanded, as you mentioned, over time, but we look at that pretty carefully, and I know that Olive Garden hasn\u2019t performed as well as we would like for it to have performed recently.","But what I would caution on is it started from very high absolute levels of performance and it\u2019s really lost momentum, is how I think of that business. So actually, the performance is quite strong, and the restaurants we have are providing sufficient cash flow for that investment.","But every year, we look at that portfolio. There\u2019s two to three roughly in that brand that are relocated, are rebuilt, to sort of that same trade area. And so I would not expect any significant changes from that. We did a full review with some of the actions we\u2019ve taken this quarter to look at our overall portfolio, and I think honestly just addressed how strong that brand is and how strong those individual restaurants are performing. But we think there\u2019s a lot of upside for those restaurants and we like where they\u2019re positioned.","Eugene Lee ","I would just add that Olive Garden restaurants doing $3.5 million with the margin structure are still very, very productive. On the lower end, $3.5. We built a lot of restaurants in the last couple of years in green space. These restaurants, at $3.5 million, a million dollars below the system average, are still highly productive.","Matt DiFrisco ","With respect to gasoline prices, I guess the general consensus opinion is that it\u2019s a net positive for restaurants. Have you seen any beginning signs of regional weakness at all? Or is it too early to see, as far as those states that might be more energy influenced with jobs and the aspirational spender? Or has it so far been somewhat of a net positive in incremental dollars and more driving and more consumer dispersion that\u2019s been benefitting the restaurant space?","Eugene Lee ","I think that\u2019s a very good question. We have seen no weakness to date in what I would call the oil-dominant markets. We have seen, as I said earlier, Knapp-Track weaken starting with the switch in Halloween. That was a real weak comparison year over year, and then we haven\u2019t seen it get back in November to where it was in October.","So we\u2019re on the lookout for signs, especially probably in Texas would be the place that we would get the first signal, that the current energy situation is having an effect on employment and attitude. But we haven\u2019t seen it yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Gene, first just sort of a broader picture question. Your new board was a big proponent, or there was a proposal for cutting a significant amount of costs in the business, and it sounds like you\u2019ve employed some consultants. So what\u2019s the timeframe where we might think we\u2019d get a more definitive answer, whether it\u2019s advertising or it\u2019s more overhead, or whether it\u2019s going to be some of the other things that are proposed, what\u2019s the timeframe to review that and get a more definitive answer?","Eugene Lee ","Right now, we have BCG in working on our indirect spend, which we define indirect spend as it\u2019s all spending that is not managed by purchasing. And our initial findings are very encouraging. We also have other cost savings initiatives going on, and we believe they\u2019ll have meaningful impact.","I believe that we will have an update as we get into next quarter\u2019s call and start talking about fiscal 2016. We\u2019ll be able to, I really think, reveal a range that we think is possible for the company. I believe today it\u2019s just a little too early for me to put a number out there. If I put a number out there, I\u2019m not sure it would be too high or too low.","And so we just need a little more time to do our due diligence. Again, we\u2019ve hired BCG, we\u2019ve got Alvarez and Marsal in here working on the marketing side, on Olive Garden, and we have multiple other cost initiatives. My commitment is that we are going to cut our costs moving forward, in all areas of the organization. And so that\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now, and it\u2019s just too early for me to give you a number.","John Glass ","And I wanted to just take one thing you mentioned, about the takeout business. It sounds like it grew 15%. I\u2019m not sure if that was this quarter or over a longer period of time. But that\u2019s 8% or 9% of sales, and it\u2019s growing 15% of sales, it\u2019s over a point of comp, I think. Is that the right way to think about it, that the takeout business has been the predominant driver of sales recently? Or am I mixing numbers up?","Eugene Lee ","No, you\u2019re absolutely correct. It\u2019s a predominant driver of sales, and the way I think about it is, some of that business, there\u2019s some trading there. And so we have some people that we\u2019re trading out of an in-restaurant experience to the to-go experience, but to maintain our growth, we\u2019re creating capacity and we\u2019re filling that capacity in the restaurants.","So it\u2019s not like this is totally a negative trade for us. So your math is correct, and it\u2019s a big part of our strategy, is we\u2019ve identified convenience as a need state that we can meet for the consumer, because of the type of food that we serve. It\u2019s so well-served for takeout.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Joseph Buckley with Bank of America.","Joseph Buckley","I\u2019d like to ask the EPS revision question a little differently. You\u2019ve written off a lot of things this quarter. How much of that narrowing up of the range by $0.03 is, presumably that\u2019s appreciation on some of these things written off that has disappeared.","Bradford Richmond ","That\u2019s actually very little impact to the current year. I think more the raising of the range is the performance in the second quarter. We were at the high end of what we had previously expected, and we\u2019re further into the year, so we can refine our estimates a little bit.","But the big impacts we talked about in November, when we announced the actions that we took then around reduction in force, and those have really been, in the current fiscal year, used also [unintelligible] this commodity inflation, which has gone up quite a bit from what we were previously thinking in the back half of the year.","But we do see that rate of inflation coming down on a sequential basis, and so we would expect the actions we take in November and the other items here to make a meaningful impact to our 2016 earnings expectations.","Joseph Buckley ","And then you mentioned hiring several consultants and banking firms, A&M, BCG, JPMorgan. Are those costs going to be lumped in additional strategic costs? Are there more adjustments coming? And what do you think you\u2019re going to spend on the real estate studies, the marketing studies, and the cost study?","Bradford Richmond ","So, the cost for what BCG is doing will be netted against the benefit we derive. That\u2019s not really a callout item. The same with A&M. Now, obviously, something in the real estate area, that we do a transaction there, those costs will really be netted against that benefit at that particular time. And so if something\u2019s driving a benefit in the current year, the cost to implement that has to be offset against each other.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mr. Chris O\u2019Cull of KeyBanc.","Chris O\u2019Cull","Gene, you talked about some of the changes in strategic priorities, but would you help us with sequencing? Is the board working with management on developing an overall corporate strategy or a multiyear plan? Or is it waiting to complete the CEO search? And would it implement some of the changes to the real estate ownership before hiring a CEO? Just trying to understand the sequencing here.","Eugene Lee ","The management and the board are working together to really look at what all the alternatives are. And so as we think about it, real estate is the biggest opportunity and it\u2019s really not consumer-facing. I like to say that our guests don\u2019t walk into a restaurant and say, is this owned, or leased? And so it really doesn\u2019t interfere with our focus of creating great dining experiences.","And so we believe we have a good strategy in place to grow shareholder value, and it\u2019s really starting at the focus on the core operational fundamentals of the business. Now, we\u2019re working closely with the board to look at all areas of improvement, and we believe starting with the real estate portfolio is the most important.","So I see it as two paths. Operationally, we need to improve the overall day-to-day operations, and that\u2019s inclusive of a lot of things. That\u2019s inclusive of growing sales, managing costs, so on and so forth. On the other strategic side, trying to maximize shareholder value, we\u2019ve prioritized real estate as the key priority. And as we move forward, we\u2019ll take another look at some of the other alternatives that could be available to us.","But prioritization is really important. How much the organization can handle at one time, I think, is a real key consideration. And so as I said in my prepared remarks, the board is very engaged. We think we have a plan that can be executed over the next six months, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at at this point in time.","I think we\u2019ll come back after we move along in the real estate process and understand how that\u2019s going to play out, and at that time, we\u2019ll take a look at some other strategic alternatives to drive shareholder value.","But most importantly, real great shareholder value is going to be created through improvement in our overall operations. We must drive profitable same restaurant sales. And so we\u2019re extremely focused organically on that right now.","Chris O\u2019Cull ","And I appreciate that, and my question really wasn\u2019t related to some of these tactical changes, even the sale of some real estate. What I\u2019m trying to understand, though, is Darden, in the future, going to be focused on managing brands that are more mature, that are great cash generators? Is it going to be focused on unit growth? Is it going to be focused on a combination of this? What\u2019s Darden Inc. going to look like in three years? Is the board working through that process?","Eugene Lee ","You\u2019re talking about a real comprehensive, longer-term strategy, and I do think that the board and the new CEO will have to work through that and will have to, after they make their decision, will have the right forum in which to inform the public of the long range plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ms. Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler","I just wanted to ask a followon question to that very topic, on the decision about remodels versus the reorg [state]. I appreciate that real estate is not a customer facing strategy, but to the extent that you\u2019re delaying remodeling of your portfolio, I\u2019m assuming, because you want to determine if you want to sell and lease back, or do some other kind of financial structuring, weren\u2019t the early indications on the remodeled units that the lift [did] change those sales with something like 600 basis points?","Eugene Lee ","Yeah, I think there are two distinct different issues. Finding a way to utilize our real estate to increase shareholder value is one. The decision to hold and slow down the remodels is really around this idea that we have, out of the 13 out there, we have five or six different investment levels.","And the results, as you mentioned, have been very positive, but the performance between investment level A and investment level C is not that different. And that\u2019s causing us to pause and to say, what is the right investment level that we need to make and get the appropriate return on that investment to drive and refresh the Olive Garden business?","And so I see this more as just being prudent, slowing down, and making sure that we\u2019re making the right investment. Half of these 13 restaurants have been done for less than 60 days. The initial read is very, very difficult. What we\u2019re trying to do here is really just be prudent and make sure that we measure twice and cut once. And that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing.","Bradford Richmond","I would just emphasize the point that Gene is making, and it\u2019s around capital discipline. This was a significant capital investment, and so we want to have a thorough evaluation. I think the key that we\u2019re trying to determine right now is the durability of these results, and separating between the investment levels, so that we optimize the return that we can get on this investment.","And then to the first part of your question, real estate opportunities that we may pursue are totally independent of the remodel choices that we have. And today, we operate a number of leased restaurants, and so we don\u2019t anticipate doing anything that would hamper our flexibility to operate these restaurants. So I would separate those two items as different decision points.","Diane Geissler ","So sale and lease [unintelligible] some restaurants wouldn\u2019t prevent you remodeling down the road?","Bradford Richmond ","Not anything that we\u2019re aware of.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ms. Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","Can I ask a question about a different piece of the business, that you\u2019ve also talked about from a strategic perspective, and that\u2019s the SRG? I think initially, I was under the impression that might be the easiest thing to do, which is to [unintelligible] that off into a separate company. But now it sounds like you\u2019re more focused on the real estate or refranchising. So can you talk about whether SRG, if that\u2019s still something that\u2019s on the docket? And how do you think about prioritizing that versus some of the other things?","Eugene Lee ","Everything is still on the table, and being analyzed. We believe, after working with the board and discussing what the options are, that addressing the real estate opportunity is the right decision. As we decide what the right brand portfolio is, what brands are in the Darden portfolio, if there is a spin, is something that the board wants to evaluate. However, I do think it\u2019s important for them to gain a better understanding of how all these businesses work before those types of decisions are made.","And so everything is still absolutely on the table. There were hard choices that had to be made, and we thought that the real estate, at this point in time, was probably the least disruptive and the opportunity that hopefully could give us a chance to increase shareholder value.","Sara Senatore ","And if I just may ask about the real estate, is there any portion of the business that could not tolerate a sale lease back, where margins are slim enough that it really wouldn\u2019t make sense to then burden them with rent expense? Is there sort of a percentage of the store base where you just couldn\u2019t do that?","Bradford Richmond ","None that we\u2019re aware of. When you look at the strength of our individual restaurants\u2019 financial performance, nothing comes to our attention at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","I wanted to get back to the previous question about potential cost opportunities in 2016, and I think, Gene, you described it as the controllables are those costs that were not controlled by the purchasing department. And presumably, that means labor, and the cost per labor hour typically goes up - I guess it always goes up really in any economy. And so understanding that labor cost per hour is going to go up, how big of a restructuring might be possible on your labor line? And are you confident at this point that that can be done with not only no customer disruption, but actually customer benefit?","Eugene Lee ","I think you\u2019re referring to labor at the restaurant level, and the way I would talk about labor at the restaurant level is about developing a system that\u2019s as efficient as it possibly can be. I think it\u2019s the opportunity of all operations departments inside the restaurant industry to be rethinking how they deliver the guest experience inside their building.","And as we move forward, it\u2019s going to be important for us to increase productivity of our operations, and that starts with how we build our menus, how we design our preparation procedures, how we design our cooking procedures, how we service the guest. And so there\u2019s going to be pressure on our ability to become more efficient.","The methodology that I like to use in this business is how many labor hours do we need to use to create a guest? And we need to create more guests from every labor hour that we use. And so you are correct. There will be pressure on the labor line. We just can\u2019t continue to ask our people to work harder. We have to design more effective operations. And I firmly believe that starts with how you design your menus.","We also need to use technology, and then we need to think about simplification. Simplification is something that a lot of restaurateurs are talking about today, but it\u2019s going to be an important part moving forward. How simple can you create an operation and still have the value proposition that you need to drive the business?","Bradford Richmond ","And I would just add one thing. If you look at our cost basket, food and beverage is about a third of it, and labor at the restaurant level is about another third of it. So those have a lot of opportunity outside of restaurant labor to pursue on top of how Gene was talking about we could go at restaurant labor itself.","So we see a wide area of opportunity. First thing that we\u2019ve been talking about is the G&A, and we\u2019ve made tremendous progress in that area. You can look at our year over year performance has been pretty good. And the fact is, as we look forward, we see ourselves below 5% for G&A as a percentage of sales.","John Ivankoe ","Yes, and I certainly see that, but question was really at the store level, as Gene pointed out. And if I may continue on that theme, do you remember a couple of years ago, at one of your analyst meetings, I think it was Dave George that was talking about some kitchen simplicity and operation, the menu simplicity at Olive Garden, that he was beginning to work on and maybe paralleling some of the [BB] experience at Olive Garden that maybe would be an opportunity at Longhorn.","So have these initiatives not yet been implemented, or are they just beginning to be implemented, or is there still a long runway to go in terms of the menu and kitchen simplicity that will presumably help on the cost side?","Eugene Lee ","When Dave got to Olive Garden, one of the first things he did was implement significant change to the kitchen operation, which created, I believe, approximately $20 million in cost savings. And so he\u2019s been developing what he would call phase two of kitchen simplification now, but a lot of that is going to come from how the menu evolved over time.","We also are looking at ways to prepare our soups more efficiently. We\u2019re looking at ways to prepare our sauces more efficiently. And so there\u2019s some production opportunities available to us in Olive Garden.","As far as Longhorn goes, the nature of a steakhouse business is that it\u2019s extremely simplistic. And that\u2019s why we create 2.7 guests for every labor hour we use in Longhorn, and we create 2.1 guests for every labor hour we use in Olive Garden. And so the opportunities for simplification in Longhorn, although they are there, are not as great as the opportunities for simplification in the Olive Garden operation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Keith Siegner with UBS.","Keith Siegner","Just two quick ones for me. To go back to the to-go business, the takeout business, and congratulations on such good success with that, as we think about that being a big part of the same-store sales, as you mentioned, how do we think about the margins on the to-go business versus the base business? If this business continues to have this kind of momentum, how do we think through that marginal margin?","Eugene Lee ","First of all, let me just reiterate that the check average is significantly higher with the online ordering, and when we move people away from ordering meals off the menu and move them to more of a bulk order, the margins improve.","And so in other words, we get orders for trays of lasagna, family meals. They\u2019ve got meals that they\u2019re offering for four, for eight, for twelve, for sixteen. The next evolution now is to get more into this catering and delivery type business, which we think is a huge opportunity. So the answer to your question, margins do improve when we get to the bulk takeout orders.","Obviously, the margins, when we\u2019re doing meals to go, are the same as they are as in the restaurant, except we lose the beverage occasion, which helps leverage our margins down in the restaurant. So we\u2019re relying on this bulk business to improve the overall takeout margins.","Keith Siegner ","And then another question, just to follow up, lunch specifically, there\u2019s a lot of competitive intensity in lunch, a lot of different concepts really trying to get creative and draw in that incremental traffic. Could you talk a little bit about the traffic trends at Olive Garden you\u2019re seeing at lunch? Maybe some of the specific programs you have in place there to address the increased competitive intensity?","Eugene Lee ","Lunch is definitely an opportunity at Olive Garden. We\u2019re feeling much more pressure with guest counts at lunch than we are at dinner. Lunch is based around the convenience for a lot of people.","The interesting thing about the Olive Garden lunch experience is that we have multiple constituents at lunch. We have guests who are looking for convenience, that want to get in and out. We have guests that are looking for a business lunch that want to be in for an hour, hour and fifteen minutes. We have a lot of guests that come to lunch, this is their big day out and they\u2019re looking for a two-hour experience.","And so we\u2019re trying to satisfy different constituencies and have offerings for all of them. We have what we believe is the ultimate fast casual lunch at Olive Garden, soup, salad, and breadsticks. It\u2019s the original fast casual offering, 30% of our guests buy that.","We believe the key to reenergizing our lunch business is some sort of evolution of this product and this offering. It\u2019s been out there since 1981, it is a great, great product, as you would expect if 30% of the people who are coming in are buying it. But we need to continue to innovate around that product.","We\u2019ve done some work with the salad toppers and some other menu items like the trios, and so we\u2019re making progress. We think lunch is really about fast, fresh, and value, and we think we have great food that can deliver on that. It\u2019s going to be price competitive. Lunch is very much about price, and we have to figure out how we create the appropriate value to reenergize lunch.","We, on average, do 275 guests a day at lunch. I would put that up against any other casual dining restaurant operator out there. We start from a place of strength, and what we need to do is we need to continue to deliver on the consumer need states for that meal occasion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ms. Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","I was hoping you could provide maybe some initial thoughts about how you\u2019re thinking about your credit ratings, particularly with regard to the evaluation of your real estate portfolio and the opportunities that lie there. And specifically, whether, as you create shareholder value, there are also opportunities for that paydown in some capacity?","Bradford Richmond ","I think fundamental to all this, and we haven\u2019t said it in this call so far, is that we do understand and value the importance of our investment grade credit profile. And so a lot of our actions are geared towards that, and we would include that in the consideration set for any type of real estate opportunities should it come along.","I think as we look ahead what we put out as our guidance and expectations for this year, along with the debt paydown that we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve talked about adjusted debt to adjusted capital of being in that 55% to 65% range. We see ourselves near the bottom of that range as we move through the year, so we\u2019re making progress there.","And the coverage ratio with this type of earnings performance gets closer to our target and gets below three times. And so we\u2019re making progress there, I think Gene talked about earlier, the success that we have in running the business will help us make further progress here, and then we\u2019ll look at opportunities as they come along for any type of action on the real estate to consider that as well.","And then one thing I wanted to follow up on is Joe, you\u2019d asked the question earlier about all the other activity adjustments that we made in the quarter, and what was their impact, and I said it was fairly minor. I actually had a chance to go back and look at those. It\u2019s about $0.01 of the impact on the annual EPS from those in the current year. So it does add a little bit, but maybe less than it seems like on the surface.]","Operator","There are no further questions over the phone at this time.","Rick Cardenas","Thank you, everybody, for your questions. We\u2019ll look forward to speaking to you soon. And again, appreciate all the questions you\u2019ve asked. Thank you."],"7298":["Darden Restaurants, Inc.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.","Kevin Kalicak","Thank you, Aubrey. Good morning and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO, and Rick Cardenas, CFO.","As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company\u2019s press release which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings on September 20th before the market opens, followed by a conference call.","This morning, Gene will discuss our quarterly performance and business highlights and Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from both the fourth quarter and the full year before providing our outlook for fiscal 2019. During today\u2019s call, all references to Darden\u2019s same-restaurant sales only include Darden\u2019s legacy brands. We will begin including Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen restaurants and our blended same restaurant sales figure in the first quarter of our new fiscal year.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. As you see from our press release this morning, we had another solid quarter to wrap up a strong fiscal 2018 for Darden. Total sales from continuing operations during the quarter were $2.1 billion, an increase of 10.3%. Same-restaurant sales for the quarter increased 2.2%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.39, an increase of 17.8% from last year.","Our strategy remains unchanged. Our operating teams are focused on becoming brilliant with the basics. They continue to create exceptional guest experiences by delivering outstanding food, drinks and service and an inviting atmosphere.","And at the Darden level, we continue to strengthen and leverage our four competitive advantages; one, our significant scale that creates cost advantages, two, our extensive data and insights that improve operating fundamentals and help us better understand our guest and communicate with them more effectively.","Three, the rigorous strategic planning process that our brands cycle through on a regular basis and four, our results oriented people culture which enables growth. All of Darden had a very good quarter. Total sales grew 4% and same restaurant sales grew 2.4%, the 50th [ph] consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden by 190 basis points. Same-restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 270 basis points.","For fiscal 2018, Olive Garden total sales increased 3.7% to $4.1 billion. Congratulations to the Olive Garden team members for achieving this significant milestone. Olive Garden\u2019s momentum as a result of our strategy to drive frequency among core guests. The success of this strategy is driven by flawless execution of the guest experience and continued simplification in our restaurants, craveable Italian food and beverage that appeals to our loyal guests, marketing that reaches the right target at the right time on the right channel with the right message and our ongoing commitment to improving convenience for our guest by focusing on the off-premise experience.","Our simplification efforts have allowed us to reduce our promotional calendar, which limits the amount of new activity in our restaurants, enabling our management teams to spend their time focused on execution. As a result, our restaurant teams continue to drive guest satisfaction to new all-time highs.","The promotional calendar simplification also enables us to increase our marketing efforts beyond limited time offers and into long-term growth drivers. During the quarter, we continued our everyday value advertising and emphasized week-day lunch messaging that strengthened our lunch trends.","Additionally, this quarter we showcase craveable Italian food that appeals to our loyal guests with our big Italian classics promotion. Giant Stuffed fettuccine and the giant meatball provided compelling value and were well received by our guests.","Finally, off-premise sales grew 9% and represented 13.8% of total sales for the quarter, further demonstrating the momentum in this area, Technomic recognized Olive Garden with its 2018 consumer\u2019s choice award for best take out experience in the full service segment.","Overall, I am very pleased with Olive Garden\u2019s performance. The business momentum is strong, driven by a strategy that is working and we will continue to make the appropriate investments in our team members and our guests.","LongHorn Steakhouse had a strong quarter as well. Total sales grew 4.9%, four times the rate of growth of the industry excluding Darden. Same restaurant sales grew 2.4%, the 21st consecutive quarter of growth outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 190 basis points and same restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 280 basis points.","LongHorn\u2019s performance is being driven by the team\u2019s inherence to a long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging LongHorn\u2019s unique operating culture.","The impact of this strategic focus was recognized when LongHorn received the 2018 consumer\u2019s choice award from Technomic for having the most loyal customers in the full-service segment. This recognition is a strong testament to the great work our operations teams are doing to drive consistent execution and create memorable guest experiences.","The LongHorn team continues to make meaningful stride reducing operational complexity. This quarter, we made more reductions in our core menu offerings and our operating processes were further simplified. Additionally, we made our limited time offers less complicated and easier for our teams to implement. This continuous improvement is resulting in better execution.","Finally, our emphasis on the culture and focus on team member engagement continues to pay off as evidenced by LongHorn\u2019s industry-leading retention rates at both the manager and on a team member level.","Our Fine Dining brands, The Capital Grille and Eddie V's delivers strong quarter with same restaurant sales growth of 2.6% and 3.6% respectively, both brands have distinctive positioning and consistently deliver exceptional dining experiences. The Capital Grille\u2019s increasing capacity in select restaurants to provide additional flexibility for large parties, while Eddie V's is focused on developing the talent needed to support growth.","And we remain excited about its future growth potential. Yard House had another good quarter with positive same restaurant sales of 1.4%. The team increased its focus on operational simplification to create consistently great experiences and made significant improvements in both cost of goods sold and labor productivity.","And we are pleased with the performance of our new restaurants and believe in continued growth of this brand. Yard House is broadly appealing with four distinct day parts that allow us to meet a variety of guest occasions.","Bahama Breeze delivered positive same restaurant sales growth of 0.6%, the 14th consecutive quarter of growth. Our guests come to Bahama Breeze for fun, which is why our restaurant teams continue to create a fun island experience amplified by events such as the successful VIVA LA 'RITA event that took place during the quarter.","The brand is uniquely positioned in the marketplace and continues to resonate extremely well with millennials. Seasons 52 generated same restaurant sales growth of 0.4% during the quarter. We took steps to broaden our appeal by improving the value perception.","For example, we featured a limited time three course offering that allowed guest to choose a starter, an entr\u00e9e and a mini indulgence for a fixed price. This improved our value perceptions and contributed to a 2.1% traffic increase for the quarter. As we continue to enhance value, the value equation, I am confident that this entr\u00e9e brand is poised to capture more guest visits over the long-term.","Now, I\u2019ll update you on Cheddar\u2019s. The Cheddar\u2019s restaurants that we own and operate today were fragmented into three different businesses a year ago, each with different systems, policies and pricing structures. While same restaurant sales declined 4.7 for the quarter, the original company restaurants were down 3.3%, while the acquired franchise restaurants were down 7%.","During the fourth quarter, integration activity peaked as we transitioned the Darden proprietary point-of-sale system. As we push the integration process to completion, it became apparent the team was losing focus on the basic operating fundamentals; therefore we decided to spend -- to spend marketing and promotional activities. We believe this was the correct decision even though we are rolling over a period of heavy promotional activities last year prior to and immediately after we closed the acquisition.","With the integration now complete, we are fully focused on rebuilding the operational foundation and the team has three priorities. One, staff our restaurants, there\u2019s an opportunity in many restaurants to increase management and team member staffing and scheduling more effectively; master the new tools, although the integration is complete the team now has to learn how to use these tools to improve operational effectiveness. As with past acquisitions, this will take time; three, simplify. This is a complex operation that must be simplified in order to improve execution. The team is making progress quickly, but we need to test these changes to ensure we get the desired outcome.","We recently asked Paul Veri [ph], a veteran operations leader who experienced first-hand the process of mastering the Darden systems during the LongHorn integration, to lead the operations team at Cheddar\u2019s. With his in-depth knowledge of the Darden systems and his track record of operational success, we are confident he will have a positive impact quickly.","Cheddar\u2019s is the value leader in casual dining, and the average restaurant serves more than 6000 guests per week. I believe the leadership team has the right plan in place to improve operating fundamentals and I remain extremely confident that Cheddar\u2019s will add significant value to Darden over the long-term.","In closing, I am very pleased with the progress we made against our strategic initiatives throughout fiscal 2018 and our performance continues to reinforce our belief that we have the right strategy in place.","I want to say thank you to our 180,000 team members who bring our brands to like every day in our restaurants and who support our restaurant teams from here and our restaurant support center. We know our team members are our greatest asset and I\u2019m confident we will continue to win our remaining focus on being brilliant with the basics as we pursue our mission to make, of making every guest loyal.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Rick.","Rick Cardenas","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone.","We had another strong quarter with total sales growth of 10.3%, driven by 8.1% growth from a full quarter of Cheddar\u2019s sales and the addition of 35 net new restaurants at our legacy brands, and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.2%.","Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were a $1.39, an increase of 17.8% from last year. This quarter, we paid $79 million in dividends and repurchased $27 million in shares, returning a total of $106 million of capital to our shareholders.","Looking at the P&L this quarter compared to last year, food and beverage was favorable 60 basis points as pricing, cost savings and synergies more than offset commodities inflation of just below 1%.","Restaurant labor was unfavorable -- favorable 90 basis points as continued wage pressures, workforce investment and Cheddar\u2019s brand mix offset pricing and productivity gains. Restaurant expense was 40 basis points favorable due to sales leverage and workers compensation expenses.","G&A was favorable 40 basis points driven by sales leverage and a reduction in the mark-to-market of our deferred compensation liability and other equity programs. And we recorded a $4.5 million impairment during the quarter, the bulk of which were attributed to certain restaurant locations.","As a result, EBIT margin expanded 30 basis points above last year and absolute EBIT grew 12.9%. Our 20.4% effective tax rate in the quarter was 290 basis points favorable to last year\u2019s rate due to tax reform, partially offset by the tax impact of our deferred compensation hedge.","Turning to our segment performance, Olive Garden and the Fine Dining segment both grew sales this quarter, driven by a positive same restaurant sales and net new restaurants. Segment profit margin increased in these segments even after the incremental workforce investments.","By leveraging same restaurant sales growth and managing costs effectively. LongHorn\u2019s segment sales also grew this quarter, driven by positive same restaurant sales and net new restaurants. Segment profit margin was 19%. Adjusting for the workforce investments, LongHorn\u2019s segment profit margin would have been 30 basis points higher than last year.","Looking at the other business segment, total sales grew 38.9% due to a full quarter of Cheddar\u2019s sales in both same restaurant sales and new restaurant growth at the other brands. Similar to last quarter, segment profit margin was 170 basis points lower than last year, due to the brand mix impact of adding Cheddar\u2019s and for moving consumer packaged goods out of this segment, primarily to Olive Garden.","Fiscal 2018 was another great year of progress as our brands continued leveraging the power of Darden\u2019s competitive advantages resulting in double-digit total sales EBIT and EPS growth.","Total sales grew 12.7% to $8.1 billion, and EBIT grew 10.2%. These results coupled with tax reform resulted in adjusted EPS growth of 19.7% while investing $20 million into our workforce.","Other accomplishments during fiscal 2018 included, returning over a $0.5 billion to shareholders consisting of $314 million in dividends and $235 million in share repurchases, realizing approximately $10 million of cost synergies from the Cheddar\u2019s acquisition, completing the rollout and integration of systems to all Cheddar\u2019s location and issuing $300 million of new 30 year debt at 4.55% replacing $311 million of our outstanding notes tendered that had higher interest coupons.","This morning, we also announced that our board approved a 19% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $0.75 per share, which results in a yield of 3.2% based on yesterday\u2019s closing share price.","And finally, yesterday our Board of Directors also approved a new share repurchase authorization for up to $500 million of Darden\u2019s outstanding common stock. This replaces the previous plan and does not have an expiration date. Now that we\u2019ve wrapped up another year, I want to take a moment and remind you of our long-term value creation framework we introduced in December of calendar 2015. This framework called for a 10% to 15% total shareholder return assuming a constant earnings multiple.","Looking back, investors who bought our stock at the beginning of fiscal 2016 reinvested all dividends in Darden\u2019s stock and held to the end of the fiscal 2018 earned an average annual total shareholder return of 18%. And looking back over any 10 fiscal year period, since becoming a public company, we have consistently achieved or exceeded our targeted total shareholder return range.","As we look to the future, we will still target a 10% to 15% total shareholder return, but are making two minor modifications to the framework. First, we are updating the targeted EBIT margin expansion range to be 10 to 30 basis points. This reflects the fact that we\u2019ve already expanded EBIT margin by more than 200 basis points in the last three years.","Second, we increased the share repurchase range to be between $150 million and $250 million. This change reflects our growing free cash flow and the significant share price appreciation since the introduction of our framework.","Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2019, we anticipate total sales growth to be between 4% and 5% driven by same restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and 45 to 50 new restaurants.","Capital spending between $425 million and $475 million, total inflation of approximately 2% with 0% to 1% commodities inflation and 3.5% to 4.5% of total labor inflation, which includes approximately 5% hourly wage inflation.","Total run rate investments of $35 million related to tax reform primarily in our workforce. Incremental synergies related to the Cheddar\u2019s acquisition of approximately $13 million and annual effective tax rate of between 11% and 12% and approximately 125 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulted -- resulting in a diluted net earnings per share between $5.40 and $5.56.","And with that, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please proceed.","Sara Senatore","Great, thank you very much. Just a couple of questions about more on really about the demand environment and then maybe LongHorn in particular. You know it feels like there\u2019s obviously a lot of really dramatic price point promotions out there. You talked a lot about being brilliant at the basics, but given that you were lapping Buy One, Take One, can you just talk a little bit about what you saw in terms of your mix at Olive and then perhaps at LongHorn very good comp, but the other, some of the other big Steakhouse\u2019s maybe comped a bit better, so could you talk about the dynamic in that category as well? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Good morning, Sara. You know I think about the demand in the space right now, we saw some improvement in April in the benchmarks, maybe fell off a little bit. I would describe the environment as volatile week-to-week, but overall, the demand has been fairly good for the casual dining brands that are well positioned with strong value propositions. In your question you brought up the fact that there are some folks, other brands out there heavily discounting and are being very promotional. We\u2019ll see, we think that that\u2019s not the right place to be right now. We are very pleased with how we \u2013 we lapped Olive Garden in the fourth quarter. We thought they had a very very strong quarter.","On the LongHorn side, the LongHorn two year stock was approximately 6%, and one of the things that I like where we are in LongHorn right now is we\u2019ve been able to really pull back on some of the incentives that we\u2019ve been, we\u2019ve had in the marketplace not really like our profitability. I really like our margins structure comparative to the other Steakhouse players.","So you know sometimes the headline same restaurant sales numbers not all -- all is not the entire piece of the puzzle. I like to look at the whole business model. I am thrilled with LongHorn\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter and a two year stack and you have to remember in LongHorn these are very small boxes that our strategy is that we maximize the blocks and then build another restaurant three miles down the road and that\u2019s how we ended up with 45 restaurants in Atlanta, Georgia.","Sara Senatore","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Please proceed.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning and congrats on another good year. My question is about -- I have a couple of questions about the guidance for 2019. So first on the comps outlook of 1% to 2% I think your long-term range when you shared originally it was comps of 1% to 3% and you consistently either have been in the middle or maybe towards the higher end of that, and just wondering why the guidance for 2019 kind of anchors on the path of that range in light of your comments about the environment being better.","And then secondly, yes it doesn\u2019t -- I guess given your tax rate guidance it doesn\u2019t really seem to suggest that at least at the midpoint that you are expecting much margin expansion or you know relative to that 10 to 30 basis points targeted. I\u2019m -- just explain kind of why you might not get a lot of margin expansion in 2019? Thanks.","Rick Cardenas","Yes, David this is Rick. On the comps, the reason that we are at the lower half of our guidance range is as Kevin mentioned on the beginning of the call we are including Cheddar\u2019s next year in our total comp. And as Gene mentioned, we still have some things to go through on the learning of the integration. I mean, we would expect Cheddar\u2019s to be on the lower end of that range, so that would bring us down from what we\u2019ve finished this year a little above 2%. So that\u2019s where we on the comp side.","On the margin side, the real difference, the real reason that we be either at the lower end or have very little margin growth next year is the additional workforce investments we are making and based on the tax reform, which actually helps on the tax line. So we\u2019ve got those two things, we\u2019ve got the workforce investment, and actually we are pricing well below our inflation, as you think about what we talked about our pricing ranges normally, and our inflation ranges so both of those things should cause our margins to be at the lower end of our range.","David Tarantino","Great, great. And Rick, just one follow-up, the workforce investments. I think the incremental amount is around $50 and did I hear you correctly that the shutters integration savings would be roughly in that same ballpark. So I guess is it more the latter factor that you mentioned around that pricing to cover inflation that\u2019s driving that outlook?","Rick Cardenas","Yes, it\u2019s more of the latter. If you think about pricing and as we\u2019ve said our strategy is to -- is to leverage Darden\u2019s scale, price below inflation, which we\u2019ve done for the last few years and we expect to do that next year.","David Tarantino","Great. Makes sense. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer & Company. You may now proceed.","Brian Bittner","Thank you. Good morning. In the quarter, now that it\u2019s over and you can go back and look back at the results. Is there any way you can tell us what the effect of not running the promotion had on sales and on COGS margins? And then I have a follow up.","Gene Lee","Very purposely on this, you know, we all I will say is that our team did a great job of implementing a new promotion to laugh over the Buy One, Take One. And as you can see by our results, we had, we had a very strong quarter. The other comment I would make about the quarter and the promotional strategy and the advertising strategy is that and I said this in my script. We have made the choice to invest some dollars into brand marketing away from promotional activity, which we -- where we believe will drive overall, enhance the brand overall, but is not as effective as your pure promotional advertising. And we think we saw some of that benefit in the quarter of the investments we\u2019ve been making in, the value platforms and advertising that.","And so, again I\u2019m very pleased. I think the team did a great job getting you know of lapping one of our most popular promotions, which we had run for an extended period of time earlier in the year. And so the total number of weeks of exposure for that promotion were down, but not down real significantly. So \u2013 the team did a great and we're very pleased with the overall results.","Brian Bittner","Okay. Thanks Gene. And Rick just two questions for you. One on the quarter; the OpEx on a current unit basis was actually down year-over-year. Can you unpack that a little bit more for us? And then, on the 2019 earnings guidance, following up on David's question, is there like specific operating margin range you want us to think about for 2019? Is it like flat to 20 basis points instead of 10 to 30? Any help on that would be great. Thanks.","Rick Cardenas","Yes. Brian, I'll start with the second question. I would say you're probably closer to flat to 20 basis points than on the higher end of that range as the follow-up to the question. And if you look at our restaurant expense line, it's primarily workers comp difference versus unpacking anything else. But the big driver of the drop in restaurant OpEx is workers comp and the synergies that we've gotten from the Cheddar's acquisition.","Brian Bittner","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein, Barclays. Please proceed.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Two just broader questions on the industry. One, Gene, I'm just wondering as you get to look at so many different brands and you said you seemed like the casual dinning industry is seeing some healthier demand trends. And I'm just wondering maybe you could talk a little bit about the sustainability or what you think of the drivers? I know in the past you've talked about when the consumer gets a benefit from whether it would be tax reform are lower guest prices that end up seeing the benefit in mix. But yet seems like this go around, mix is relatively flat. You saw a nice uptick in traffic. I'm just wondering if you kind of parse through what you think are the drivers of that?","And the second question was just on the industry. As we look to 2019 I know you're guiding to 1% to 2%, I'm wondering what you're assuming in that for the broader industry, because it does seem like your comp gap has narrowed over the past number of quarters. I'm wondering whether you see that narrowing further in fiscal 2019 or how comfortable you are with the potential gap as we think about 2019? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Jeff. This is a lot in there. Again, it's hard to predict the future demand in our space. We have tendency to want to look back at the past as a predictor of the future. More discretionary income for the consumer should be good for restaurants, and I'll keep coming up to. Should we good for the well-positioned that have strong brand propositions and have strong value equations all throughout the menu? I still think that the consumer does not want to be told what they have to purchase in your restaurant to get value. They want value in everything that they purchased and that's why these promotional constructs are somewhat \u2013 I don't think it's as effective as they have been in the past.","Now, as far as our gap and how to think about that, I think that we've had a very good sustained performance of \u2013 out performance of the industry. And when we think about it what we're really focused on is how do we invest in our businesses to ensure that we can hit a long-term framework over time of 1% to 3% same restaurant sales growth. And were not trying to maximize the quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year, and there are times when we really need to make investments to ensure that our value perceptions improving and is better than is better than our competitors. And that's what our focus is.","When we think about our guidance for next year, I'll just reiterate, I think what Rick was trying to get across is, we expect Cheddars to be a little bit of a drag to our other brands and have an impact. And that's why that we're down at 1% to 2%. And at this point in time we believe we have the right recipe, no pun intended to really improve the operations in the Cheddar's system and drive same-restaurant sales. But we all know that trying to drive same-restaurant sales to operational improvements takes more time than coming up with an advertising promotional and advertising gimmick to the drive sales. We want to build the foundation that can move this business forward and sustainable for the long-term. And that is our plan and we're going to stick to it. And so that's how -- that's when we think about our guidance. That's what's was impacting it.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Palmer, RBC. You may now proceed.","David Palmer","Thanks. Just a follow-up. About Olive Garden, assuming that comp gap to the industry has been hit by not running not only the Buy One Take One, but fewer promotions throughout fiscal 2018. I know you're trying to simplify and improve everyday value. But could you maybe give us some numbers or anecdotes about why this strategy has been good or will be good for Olive Garden heading into fiscal 2019? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Gene Lee","All right, David. I don't believe that going from nine promotions to six promotions had any impact on our comparable store sales throughout the quarter. We believe that simplifying a promotional construct allows us to execute at a much higher level, at the restaurant level. We believe that it takes some cost out of the overall system from a training standpoint, from a supply chain standpoint. Our belief that we as restaurateurs sometimes get bored with our own messaging faster than the consumer does when you look at the frequency of our consumer. So we believe this was a really important move in our simplification effort and we believe it had no impact on our overall same-restaurant sales for the year or the quarter.","David Palmer","And then, back to Cheddar's, I know you're talking about using new tools and the staffing up and the simplification there. Lot of that sounds like stuff you've done before even at a greater scale with Olive Garden. What is your thought about the rate of improvement you can get with just these tools and the learning curve? Is it something of a six to 12 months nature?","Gene Lee","Yes. I'm not going to put a timetable around it. Our challenges are significant here especially in the acquired franchise restaurants. And we had to weaken the base of the base restaurants by pulling human resources out of those restaurants that help staff, the acquired restaurants. I would say around this is you know they're in their 14th month of integration, which is really the low point. And even I think about where I was at and how I felt at the 14 month of integration when we were acquired. It wasn't a great place. And I talked, there's a few others on my team around what it was like. And we're thinking about that and trying to help the Cheddar's team really focus and get back to what we call, brilliant with the basics.","We got a great team. We got great people. They all want to do the right things. We just need to ensure that we can help them, get those basics. And we're going to start with staffing. The turnover rates are too high. We're not fully staffed before we can make meaningful improvement in the overall guest experience. We're going to make meaningful improvement in the team member experience. So we're focus on those basic things. How long that's going to take? I don't know. Obviously when we start wrapping some of the weaker comparables, hopefully we can get back positive at that point in time.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregory Francfort, Bank of America. Please proceed.","Gregory Francfort","Hey, Gene, I just had a follow-up on the Cheddar's integration. Can you maybe walk back through your overall process of integrating the brand? And then just any expectation on like how you think about the relationship between total sales and comparable sales on a go forward basis?","Gene Lee","Yes. At a high level when we think about integrations, it's really the first few months is you're assessing the work that you need to do. You bring a third-party to help manage the process and then you design the system. You got to design are our proprietary POS system which is the major change, which in the fourth quarter we had the biggest impact and the biggest impact was on the original own Cheddar's. We've done the franchise restaurants first.","And then you start with the real \u2013 the first disrupter is the supply chain integration into our supply chain network, which is pretty invasive because when we think about it\u2019s the same product coming in, but the package size is different, the delivery times are different, how you account for, it's different. So there's just a lot of change. And then the big one is the POS system. And then from there when you implement the POS system you implementing all our productivity tools, and that's when you really impact the management because it's all brand new to them.","And even though we partner them up with our other local restaurants; that's take time. It's going to take a year for them to become proficient on these new tools which are significantly better than the tools that they had and should improve productivity. And there was also -- we also have to make changed to all the benefits and programs and put them on our programs, which is disruptive. And I think from a human standpoint during this process what you think about is how this is going to impact you and you're really concerned about that. And that takes your focus away from everyday taking care of guests and taking care of team members. So that's really that the process. Remind me the second part of that question?","Gregory Francfort","Second part was just, how you talked about total sales and comparable sales is playing out? How you think about that relationship going forward?","Gene Lee","Yes. On that relationship going forward, I think that we believe in the relative share model and Cheddar's relative share in the markets in which they compete in is very low. And prior management had a \u2013 I was really adverse to adding a lot units into the marketplace because of the headline comp number. And the example I like to give is that we've got \u2013 we're doing over a $100 million in sales in Olive Garden in Orlando Florida and we're doing close to 22 or 23 million in Cheddar's. So the opportunity is for us to be able to do a lot more volume there which is going to put pressure on the headline number in these markets that we're growing out. And so we think long-term that the real focus on Cheddar's for us is going to be how do we grow top line sales by adding units and maintaining a relatively healthy comp number, but we can add 15 units to the Orlando market and expect comps to be solid. But we think by becoming more \u2013 by having a bigger relative share we will increase the overall profitability of the overall business.","Gregory Francfort","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thanks you. Our next question comes from John Glass, Morgan Stanley. You may now proceed.","John Glass","Thanks very much. Gene, at one time I'd heard you talk about LongHorn potentially being a national brand if you could sort of get the West Coast and California markets to work in particular. Where are you in that process of discovering whether that is feasible, and that you're able to more rapidly expand our West in particular?","Gene Lee","I think we're within 24 months of having a couple restaurants open in the great state of California.","John Glass","Okay, great. Thank you. And then, Rick, on the guidance and the reduced long-term framework of 10 to 30 basis points versus 20 to 40 in the past or 10 to 40 in the past. Is that just the function as you framed that is doing so much margin expansion you can get in this business? And you've already achieved a lot. Are you also factoring in just a higher level of reinvestment necessary in this business? You're factoring in that wages are structurally going to be in that four plus percent range? Are there other factors I guess, just what you've already done that impact your view on the lower margin expansion opportunities in the future?","Rick Cardenas","Yes. There are a few other factors. As I said, we have taken -- we have increased our margins couple hundred basis points since we announced that framework. We've also taken significant cost out of our P&L. We continue to find other costs to take out, but we have been reinvesting a lot of that. Just to frame it, it's only a 10 basis reduction in the top end. So it still \u2013 it's only going from 40 basis points to 30. But as we've mentioned we continue to price below inflation. We put our price below our competition which is our strategy that put pressure on margins. And we use the Darden scale advantages to find other cost saves to help that.","Wages are, as we said our hourly wage we have inflation of around 5% in our guidance for this year. And so that's why we're bringing that down. There's nothing structurally different other than wages are little bit higher. We are continuing to go after our strategy of pricing below our competition and pricing at a range that doesn't drive a whole lot of top line margin at the restaurant level.","John Glass","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Will Slabaugh, Stephens Incorporated. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. Thanks for taking my question guys. And this is actually [Indiscernible] on for Will. And my first one is kind of around -- you continue to simplify operations at both Olive Garden and LongHorn, and specifically thinking about kind of LongHorn and removing the good amount of SKUs the last couple of quarters and yet comps have remained pretty impressive in the loyalty factor as well. And so, at many restaurants we've seen something similar done and it's become a drag on those businesses. What has allowed you to implement kind of these streamlining initiatives and continue grow same-store sales without bringing disruption to the in-restaurant operations?","Gene Lee","Well, the way we think about this is the process from the back door to the table. How do we simplify all the procedures? How do we simplify the processes between the grill and the expediting station, and how we quickly get the food to the table? So we break it down into those areas. I think as we think about pure menu simplification, it's the art not the science. It\u2019s the art of being able to put a menu together that covers all the significant areas that your guest want to be covered without having a lot of products doing or working in the same ways and ensuring that you have unique interesting products in each of those categories.","And if you do that, I think that you can create -- artfully create a menu that meets the consumer needs, but yet allows you to simplify your execution, so that you can execute that product at a really, really high level. And when we think about our industry no one has done this better than Hillstone. And for many, many years they've had a very limited menu and executed extremely high level. But if you ever study their menu, they do a wonderful job of hitting every possible area our consumer might want to dine. And I think that's what we're trying to do is, remove the duplicity in our menus with similar products really providing an opportunity for our guest to eat what they want but without having two choices in the same particular area. And that's where we're focused on. And we think there's still \u2013 we believe there's still lot of work to be done here. And so, at the end of the day, we need it to deliver on the food side, a product that's executed the way it's been designed to be executed with and being delivered extremely hot and favorable to the guest. And that's what we're obsessively focused on.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. Appreciate that. And then just one quick one on kind of the progress at Olive Garden on third-party delivery, I know in the past you've been more focused on the opportunity of large party catering. But is there any update on either of those fronts?","Gene Lee","Let me provide an update on this. We have met with and have test going on with all third-party delivery services of scale. There continues to be significant hurdles that we need to work through, such as how do we ensure that these delivery services will enhance our brands? Can it be flawlessly executed for our guests and our team members? Can we create a sustainable incremental growth at scale that's additive to our company? Can we agree on viable economics? And lastly, can we ensure that we own the data?","Now, those are the things that we need to really work through in order to get to a place that we are -- we can partner with one or two of these organizations. We're still testing, doing small order self delivery. We'll continue analyze what the opportunity is there. We also recognize that we have 400 plus restaurants out there that are participating on a local basis with some of these companies. Those aren't what I would call sanctioned tests, but they are part of what's happening. We think this is an interesting space. However there's a lot of hurdles to get over also including how do we deal with a $0.5 billion we're doing in Olive Garden take-out sales today and how would that's be impacted and what the margin impacts are of that? So that's our update on where we are with the third-party delivers. We are continuing to meet with them and try to understand what opportunities are.","Unidentified Analyst","Sure. That's it from me. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Jon Tower, Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Jon Tower","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Olive Garden on a two-year basis the traffic trends were pretty solid. And I'm just curious if you could breakdown where you're seeing the growth? Is that coming in earlier parts of the day? I know one of the promotions you did in the fiscal third quarter was focused on that three to 5 O'clock time window? Or you're seeing greater growth during the weekdays or weekends? If there's any kind of breakdown you could provide for us that would be helpful?","Gene Lee","The overall business in Olive Garden is strong in all periods. We continue to focus on value at lunch. We continue focus on value from three to five. And with Cucina Mia! platform and some of the other value platforms that we're running when this Giant Meatball was a hit, and the Stuffed Fettuccine was a big hit. That was right in the sweet spot of what we're doing of our core guest. So we're seeing strength all throughout growth of business. I wouldn't point to one particular period.","Jon Tower","Okay. And I know a primary objective of management has been to drive frequency of core guest at Olive Garden and pretty much across the brand. So, is there any chance you could give us a breakdown on how the frequency of those core guests have change over the past several years, maybe frame it somehow?","Rick Cardenas","Yes, John. This is Rick. I'm not going to give specific numbers, but we segment our consumers into different groups. And the ones that we are focusing on and the ones that are high-frequency and most recent, and that group of consumers is growing faster than any other group that we have.","Jon Tower","Okay, great. And then, lastly just a clarification. I know today you had some new compensation agreements announced. And I was wondering if that's included in that 15 million of incremental tax saving reinvestment into the business in fiscal 2019?","Rick Cardenas","No, John, that's not part of the 15 million.","Jon Tower","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Greg Badishkanian, Citi. Please proceed.","Fred Wightman","Hey, guys. It's actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. We saw a large casual dinning franchisee file for bankruptcy earlier this quarter. Is that something that you think is meaningful from an industry perspective? And then if so, what you think that sort of indicates for unit growth or closures across the category going forward?","Gene Lee","Yes. I don't think that's meaningful. I think that's more about someone reorganizing their balance sheet. I think there'll be continued store closures and there'll continue store openings as the weak continue to struggle that aren't as well-positioned, they maybe overexposed. But I don't -- I still think that we're going to see a net positive unit growth going into the next couple of years.","Fred Wightman","Thanks. And then can you just remind us how you're evaluating the returns on that $35 million of employee spending if its turnover or crew satisfaction. Is there anything that you can sort of give us early days or early reads?","Gene Lee","No. That's something \u2013 this is \u2013 I mean, I truly believe that we need to invest in to 180,000 team members who bring our brands to life every single day. We continuously evaluate our position in the marketplace from a benefits and overall employment proposition. And we believe these were the right things to do in order for us to maintain our leadership from a retention standpoint. And I believe we have the best team members in the business and I want to continue to reinvest with them when I have the opportunity. I'm very thankful for what they do every single day. There's no one sitting around me here that serves one meal or cooks one meal. These people do it. And I want to continue to reinvest in them.","Fred Wightman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Chris O\u2019Cull, Stifel. Please proceed.","Chris O\u2019Cull","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Gene, the company has argued that if it gets organized to successfully add brands to its portfolio and benefit from synergies. And I know you guys are getting the synergies in the Cheddar's acquisition. But do the integration issues with Cheddar's caused the company to rethink its approach to acquisitions? If so, kind of what have you learned and what things would you change?","Gene Lee","No, not at all. I mean, I think that the -- I would call the acquisition indigestion we're having with Cheddar's today was the exact same that we had with LongHorn 10 years ago. I mean, I think we've got -- I've got a very long-term approach to this. And I look and I understand that we are going to have some issues as we integrate brands, but I look at where we are with Yard House today and Eddie V's and in LongHorn and Capital Grille.","Cheddar's is going to work its way through this, and its going to be a dynamic brand. And not all these are going to move at the same level. We continue to do it what we call post-game analysis after we do these acquisitions. One of things we did this time is, we moved a little faster with integrating into our systems. We think that was helpful. Hopefully that will play out that we'll recover a little bit quicker. But this has no impact in if anything would make me more confident in our ability to do it.","Chris O\u2019Cull","Okay. And then just secondly, can you quantify the impact to Cheddar's same-store sale of pulling the promotions? And will the promotional activity would be more comparable going forward year-over-year?","Gene Lee","No. We can't give you the impact of it, but we just know that before we owned it that they were promoting extremely heavily to keep their same-store sales positive, so we didn't have an opportunity to retrieve the deal. And we know that before we got into really the integration, they were continuing to keep those \u2013 that promotional cadence alive. We believe like other brands that compete in this space that promotional activity and marketing is not key. We want to put those dollars on the plate. We want to create value where the consumer can see it every day. And I think we all know that there's another competitor out there that does that extremely well and we want to take that strategy and implement that strategy and keep the strategy with this brand. We will continue to focus them on the basics. We believe that we have great competency and in executing the basics of the restaurant operation that we're going to focus this team on doing that.","Chris O\u2019Cull","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole Miller, Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Nicole Miller","Thanks. Good morning. In our research we saw corporate bonds [ph] go towards the low income or low middle income demographic. And they also have an improved personal finance outlook. Is this anything you could attribute to your same-store sales growth? I would say especially at Olive Garden and maybe at LongHorn?","Gene Lee","I think all those types of things are contributing. I wouldn't point to one specific demographic indicator. I think there is multiple indicators out there that are contributing to the overall growth of the well-positioned brands. And so that's definitely not hurting. But I wouldn't I would attribute it singularly for Olive Garden's strength.","Nicole Miller","And then just second question on the Olive Garden off-premise, I think you said up 9%, 14% of sales. Could you talk about the pieces to go, catering delivery etcetera and how that each perform just quantitatively if possible?","Gene Lee","No. We're not going to talk about for competitive reasons for that kind of detail. The one I'd say, I'll get this in is that over three-year period we were up 50% in our off-premise. So our teams have done an extremely good job of ramping up the experience and improving the overall satisfaction of our take-out -- our off-premise consumer. Our guests love the experience. Our team has done a great job with it. They're going to continue to improve their capabilities as the business grows, but a job well done by the Olive Garden team, 50% over three years is fantastic.","Nicole Miller","Thanks Gene.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco, Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. I have a question and just a couple quick follow-ups. I guess in the past, Gene, you've been somewhat not so much enamored with a quick casual category inciting that the demographic seems a lot more narrow or smaller than the casual dining audience out there. I wonder -- have you seen a beginning in the industry of the lunch I guess the assault that the quick casuals had on the casual dining lunch business. Has that sort of tapered off for the industry? I mean, I know you guys have improved your value at lunch, but I'm talking more so for the industry. And has lunch strengthened a little bit or the share loss, has that sort of slowed?","Gene Lee","Yes. I think the way we would describe it is that it was a headwind with the amount of units, fast casual units being added. That headwinds probably been diminished somewhat as the unit growth for that segment slowed. And I know I think that categories economics are difficult and we've been able to actually come in and give the consumer better value with full service experience. So that's how we think about. We think that the headwinds been removed.","Matthew DiFrisco","Okay. And then Rick, with free cash flow guidance is anything we should read into that as far as the return to shareholders that you're guiding towards as far as a signal on your appetite for acquisitions going forward? Or is that still something on the table if you look very long-term as far as the growth model for the Darden portfolio?","Gene Lee","Yes. I think as you look at the guidance we've only increase the CapEx by \u2013 well, not the CapEx, the share repurchase by $50 million year-over-year. So it's not a significant change. But we do know that because our share price went up we needed to do that. We have plenty of debt capacity if something comes along that makes sense for us, but we're not going to talk necessarily about specific acquisitions or doing acquisitions. We know that our long-term framework works with or without those in acquisition.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. And then just the last question with -- going back to the delivery question; off-premise being around 13 or 14 for Olive Garden, does that represent an opportunity and something that signals delivery could raise the ceiling? Or some people get concerned sometimes that when you flip the switch delivery, its going to cannibalize the existing off-premise business and add a layer of service to it and cost. So would this be 13% than success you've had with off-premise. Would that delay your rollout of delivery or is this something that says you need to raise the ceiling and delivery might come sooner?","Gene Lee","Well, I would go back Matt to the significant huddles I described. We need to get comfortable that we have solved for these, especially in our \u2013 its going to be brand enhancing. And so our goal was to meet the consumer needs state of convenience. We're going to continue to focus on that. There are no limitations on a number. We believe through our research that we're capturing up a lot of occasions in Olive Garden. We wouldn't capture the people that using our off-premise services that would probably not come into our restaurants. We believe that people are from the most part the decision-making is and my taking out or dining in tonight, and then they decide where they're going to go.","So I'm not as concerned about what the number is. I've said in the past, I think if the consumer \u2013 the need state continues grow Olive Garden's off-premise could go to 20%. How we get that, that still yet to be determined. We are focused right now \u2013 continue to be focused on large party catering, over $100 with 24 hour notice. We like that business. And we're being -- it's been very well received by the consumer set.","Matthew DiFrisco","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Andrew Strelzik, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Andrew Strelzik","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I hate to belabor the point on the off-premise business. Obviously growth is still healthy, but at 9% it was a bit lower that we were use to seeing and it's obviously become lot more competitive with others getting involved there. So is there anything that you're considering doing any levers at your disposal to support that growth going forward? And I guess more broadly as we're seeing a lot of concepts talk about incremental growth from off-premise. Where do you think those eating occasions are coming from primarily?","Gene Lee","Yes. On the first part of the question I think that we're going to continue to execute our strategy and try to drive the off-premise business. The 9% number does not bother me at all. I think at a two-year stack at 25 and we got a three-year stack of over 50 on an annual basis. So that's healthy. And where is this coming from? I think its trading out of grocery and with some extent, I think for the first we've seen \u2013 I saw a chart recently where food, out of home, eclipsed the grocery sales. I might not have that full accurate, but it's pretty darn close. So I think people are just thinking about convenience differently. And we also \u2013 let's not forget we have a demographic wave with millennial's coming our way, which could benefit us over time. And there's a lot of good data out there about this demographic wave.","Andrew Strelzik","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Karen Holthouse, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Karen Holthouse","Hi. Going back to Olive Garden, the promotional strategy, I know last year was nine promotions or two years ago, I guess at this point with nine promotions. Last year it was six. And I think you kind of framed it is a little bit of testing year to see sort of the cost in terms of traffic versus the benefits in terms of executions, simplicity. How do you feel about sort of those different levers or the puts and takes this year? And how should we think about the promotional calendar headed into next year?","Gene Lee","I will get into some dangerous territory here for me to speak to too openly about this as our competitors would love to know what our promotional cadence was going to be next year. All we'll say is I think that our team has executed six promotions extremely well. They kept them fresh for a longer period of time. They use some innovative tactics to do that. And I want to continue encourage them to be creative and to be able to run our promotions on a longer scale and try to reach more consumers through innovative, integrated marketing opportunities. But I'm not going to signal what our promotional calendar is for next year.","Karen Holthouse","Thanks. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ivankoe, JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","John Ivankoe","Hi. Great. Thank you. Gene, we've kind of \u2013 you talked obviously lot about your outperformance relative to the industry. But the industry itself same-store traffic in your May quarter, in your fourth quarter were still negative. So, can you comment, I guess why you think casual dining same-store traffic is still negative at this point in the cycle and if there's any insights that we can have maybe on a market by market basis that stuff may be some markets that you think maybe have leading indicators with a positive or negative that may influence the rest of the country in terms of future segment trends?","Gene Lee","I'll take the latter part of that first. We see nothing when we look across the individual ADIs. Sales are little weaker in New England in that marketplace, but for the most part it's fairly similarly as we look across the country. Why do I think casual dinning in general is struggling to grow traffic? It\u2019s a mature industry that is somewhat over-restauranted and in an environment like that it's going to expose the weaknesses of brands that aren't positioned well. And that's exactly I think where we are as an industry. And those who have been willing to do less guests, charge more money and try to make additional profit that way are going to end up paying a price.","And the brands that are focused on maintaining their guest counts and even driving their guest counts and willing to give up short-term margin and pricing below inflation and competitors will continue to take share. And I think there is some really good brands out there that are really well-positioned that continue to do that. And I think we have a lot of them in our stable. I think we're better positioned than most because of our scale and what we're doing with that and insights. And we'll continue to stay focused on that. But we see an opportunity in a mature market to gain share.","Rick Cardenas","All right. Aubrey, I think we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Anderson, Maxim Group. Please proceed.","Stephen Anderson","Yes. Good morning. And not to belabor the point about the post integration efforts over at Cheddar's, but in the past calls you've mentioned about maybe rolling out some sales building initiatives and including things like up off-premise sales. And do you think at this point it maybe a bit premature to discuss that as something that you might consider even in the first half of the fiscal year?","Gene Lee","No. We're going to be focus on staffing our restaurants, simplifying our operation and improving and mastering the new systems that we put in. Right now these restaurants on average do over 6000 guests a week. I want to delight those guests with a great experience and that's our focus right now.","Stephen Anderson","Okay. And then now regard to some of the menu price rationalization that you've done in a number of markets. Has that process now been completed?","Gene Lee","In the Cheddar's system, yes, we've got them fairly much aligned on the right -- on the similar pricing structures and it\u2019s a good question, because that was painful but it was the right thing to do.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Brian Vaccaro, Raymond James. Please proceed.","Brian Vaccaro","Hi, thanks and good morning. Just wanted to circle back on the Olive Garden advertising. Notice that their reported marketing spend overall was up about 8% year-on-year. Was that a meaningful driver of Olive Garden comps during the quarter that was maybe able to offset the Buy One, Take One lap and given the intensely competitive environment we are still in, should we expect ad spend as a percent of sales to be up perhaps in fiscal 2019?","Gene Lee","First of all, we're just verifying, but our advertising spend in Olive Garden was not up for the quarter or the year. And so I don\u2019t know what you are looking at, but I believe it was actually probably a little less.","Rick Cardenas","Yes, I think you are looking at the actual income statement which didn\u2019t have Cheddar\u2019s in all of last year. When you look at total marketing spend, as we said as a percent of sales, our marketing was down 10 basis points. We are at favorable 10 basis points, so that would have been mainly adding another brand with other sales.","Brian Vaccaro","Okay, understood, understood. And I guess any comments on fiscal 2019 overall ad spend as a percent of sales.","Gene Lee","No comments specifically on marketing spend, just take \u2013 go back to our framework and where we are going to be, we wouldn\u2019t anticipate marketing as a percent of sales to be significantly different year-over-year but no comment on specific ad spend.","Brian Vaccaro","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then also if I could just shift gears to the food cost during the quarter. Rick, can you quantify the savings that you achieved in the quarter and how we should think about sort of the food cost savings specifically into fiscal 2019 and then last question from me just thinking about your fiscal 2019 EBIT margins if it\u2019s I think you said closer to flat year-on-year, what does that assume in terms of G&A in fiscal 2019? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Yes, so we mentioned total synergies for the year. I\u2019m not going to go specifically for the quarter, but total synergies for the year were about $10 million and about half of those are in cost to sales. And, that helped price \u2013 offset pricing below inflation. The other part of your question on G&A, we would anticipate as we\u2019ve said before to leverage G&A every year maybe by 10 basis points, so if we are at zero next year that would imply zero EBIT margin, that would imply that our restaurant level margins were down 10 basis points, but we are not saying we are going to be at zero, just assume we probably will get about 10 basis points of leverage in G&A.","Brian Vaccaro","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Scott, Mizuho. Please proceed.","Jeremy Scott","Hey thanks. Just had one follow up there. Just wanted to ask about your food basket, everything we are looking at within the case that you are likely to see more deflationary tailwinds especially on approaching in dairy and of course you mentioned the supply chain benefits of your many simplifications. So I was just wondering what\u2019s behind conservatism in fiscal 2019 assuming that\u2019s the way you are contracted or can we see some relief in the back half of the year or into 2020? Or is there something we\u2019re missing?","Gene Lee","Yes, you\u2019ve got to understand about when we take contract and when we buy, we have in our presentation that\u2019s out on the website our coverage this year is about, we\u2019re about 65% covered from for the first half of the year which is about where we were last year within 5% plus or minus and all of those we believe will be at low single digit inflation primarily. So that\u2019s why we think for the year the inflation number we have given is appropriate.","Jeremy Scott","So I guess when you are thinking about maybe the portion that\u2019s not covered, you will likely lock in prices that are well below what you are currently experiencing, right?","Gene Lee","Well we are talking about single digit -- 0% to 1% inflation in commodity. So, it\u2019s really a function of when we buy we are pretty much covered as I said 65% and it\u2019s also a function of where we are last year and what last year\u2019s cost. Now, if costs come in lower, and we take coverage when we do, we\u2019ll let you know but right now we still believe that our commodity inflation assumption is accurate.","Jeremy Scott","Great, okay thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Penney, Hedgeye. Please proceed.","Howard Penney","Thank you so much. Gene, I wanted to go back to your answer to the delivery question and why you think it\u2019s so important for you to own the customer data as a part of your delivery assessment? Thanks.","Gene Lee","Hey, Howard we think it\u2019s really important because these delivery services are net neutral sites. However, their goal is to sell as much food as possible. On their platform we will ensure that we own our data and our data is not used against us. And that\u2019s very very important in this whole negotiation and we want to be able to benefit from our own data but we want to ensure that our data is not used against us and we believe on our platform we talk about data being one of our competitive advantages and we have over the last decade, we have been behind a lot of trends because we\u2019ve built our own proprietary systems so that we can own the data. And we believe that that\u2019s going to be key going forward. So it\u2019s an important part of this negotiation.","Howard Penney","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jake Bartlett, SunTrust. Please proceed.","Jake Bartlett","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Rick, I'm hoping you can give us an update on what your cost savings were for the full year in 2018. In the third quarter, there were some pieces kind of given in the Q on the COGS side, but also on the labor productivity in your slides. So I'm wondering what the overall result was for the year?","And then it sounds like you're not expecting really material savings in 2019. Just to confirm that, just given your guidance.","Rick Cardenas","Yes Jake, we haven\u2019t specifically called that cost savings over the last year or so, because we\u2019ve generally been reinvesting those savings. And so the only savings we\u2019ve been talking about are synergies from the Cheddar\u2019s acquisition. We did get cost savings in the fiscal year that just ended. We reinvested those as Gene has mentioned in the past, we have reinvested in food quality, in people and other areas. So we are really not ready to talk about any other cost savings.","Jake Bartlett","Got it. But when you say reinvest, you also mean reinvest in pricing? I mean that allows you to keep the pricing low?","Rick Cardenas","Absolutely. That is one of our reinvestments. We did price below inflation, when you include labor and food cost, we price below inflation and if you look at check growth in the industry, our check growth was well below the industry for this fiscal year and the last quarter.","Jake Bartlett","Got it. Okay and then quick question on Cheddar's. Part of the deceleration in same-store sales this quarter was pulling back on promotions as you got the integration going and working through that. Do you expect to quickly reignite those promotions? Or is this one reason why you expect kind of weaker results and kind of Cheddar's bringing the whole same-store sales down for the year for the whole company?","Rick Cardenas","Jake, I mean you\u2019ll start to see us slowly bring back some promotional activity. But right now our focus is on getting our restaurants staffed and ensuring that we are scheduling properly and that are we creating great guest experiences in all of our Cheddar\u2019s-- I mean this is really back to basics and the system has been through a lot, we got \u2013 they are all great people. Myself, Dave, George we are fully aware. We went through this, we are fully aware what they are going through and we want to help them get back to doing basic things and when is the right time to start adding some more promotional activity we\u2019ll add some more promotional activity. We have great people trying to do great things. We are just here to try to help them get accelerate that.","Jake Bartlett","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, there are no questions in queue. Back to you speakers.","Gene Lee","Thank you. That concludes our call. I want to remind you that we plan to release first quarter results on Thursday September 20th before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."],"6956":["Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) Q1 2013 Earnings Call September 21, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Matthew Stroud - Vice President of Investor Relations","C.

Also, we are planning to host our annual analyst and investor meeting here in Orlando on February 25 and 26, 2013. More details would be available soon.","We released first quarter earnings results this morning. These results were available on PR Newswire and other wire services. We recognize that most of you have reviewed our first quarter earnings results, so we won't take time to go through them in detail once again in an effort to provide more time for your questions. We will offer a line item summary of the P&L, discuss our financial outlook for fiscal 2013 and discuss our brand-by-brand operating performance summary.","To begin, Brad will provide detail about the financial results for the first quarter. Drew will review the operating performance of the brands, and Clarence will offer some closing comments. We will then respond to your questions.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","C. Bradford Richmond","Thank you, Matthew, and good morning. Darden's total sales from continuing operations increased 4.8% in the first quarter to $2.03 billion. Our blended same-restaurant sales base -- on a blended same-restaurant sales basis, results for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse declined 0.3% in the first quarter. We saw continued strong same-restaurant sales gains in our Specialty Restaurant Group, with a 2.2% same-restaurant sales growth on a blended basis.","Food and beverage expenses for the first quarter were approximately 15 basis points lower than last year on a percentage of sales basis. This favorability was driven by lower cost for seafood, partially offset by higher cost for beef and a 40 to 50 basis points unfavorable impact related to the promotional pricing strategy this quarter. And as a reminder, we value our inventory on an average cost basis, so we would expect to see more favorability in seafood cost as we move into the second quarter.","For the first quarter, restaurant labor expenses were approximately 77 basis points lower than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to sales leverage, productivity gains and improved wage rate management. Restaurant expenses in the quarter were approximately 49 basis points lower than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to cost favorability in credit card fees, utilities, workers' compensation and public liability expenses.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 131 basis points higher than last year as a percentage of sales due to higher media cost, relocation cost associated with the redesign of our operations organization structure and the impact of certain of our benefit programs. Approximately 1\/3 of the increase in SG&A expense this quarter was related to higher media cost, with 1\/2 of that increase from media inflation and the other half from an additional flight of media at LongHorn and additional weight at Red Lobster and Olive Garden. The redesign of our operations organization structure will help support our future growth and increase day-to-day in-restaurant leadership. The one-time launch cost of this effort added approximately 15 basis points of expense this quarter.","As noted in the press release, an increase in the fair value of our benefit programs increased selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter by approximately 60 basis points compared to the prior year. These programs are economically hedged on an after-tax basis, such that the tax and SG&A impacts related to these activities were offsetting for the quarter on a diluted net earnings per share basis. As a result of the hedging activities, the effective tax rate was reduced by approximately 100 basis points for the first quarter this year compared to the prior year.","Depreciation expense in the quarter was approximately 22 basis points higher on a percentage of sales basis compared to the last year because of the increase in new units and the remodel programs at our larger brands. Our tax rate this quarter at 24.1% was approximately 320 basis points lower than the prior year, driven by increases in available tax credits and our tax planning initiatives, including the previously discussed employee benefit hedge. We continue to estimate that our annual effective tax rate will be approximately 26%, which is about 100 basis points higher than last year's annual effective tax rate. This annual effective tax rate will vary from quarter-to-quarter.","In the first quarter, reported total company operating profit margins fell by approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year, but adjusting for the effects of the increase in the fair value of our benefit programs would have resulted in a 50 basis points increase. This increase despite difficult same-restaurant sales comparisons at Red Lobster and increased beef cost at LongHorn Steakhouse that we chose not to fully offset with pricing. Individually, Olive Garden, Red Lobster and the Specialty Restaurant Group saw absolute operating profit dollar and margins increase this quarter. We're confident LongHorn Steakhouse would have grown operating profit margins too if not for the inordinately high inflation in the cost of beef.","Now stepping back from all the details, our first quarter financial performance is consistent with our annual outlook that we shared with you at the beginning of the fiscal year. Now turning to our financial outlook. For the full fiscal year, we expect combined same-restaurant sales growth for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse of approximately plus 1% to plus 2%, and we continue to expect net new restaurant increase of approximately 100 to 110 restaurants, not including Yard House , which is about 5% unit growth on our current base.","With these same-restaurant sales and net new unit restaurant openings expectations, plus the acquisition of Yard House, we continue to expect total sales growth in fiscal 2013 of between 9% and 10% and to anticipate that diluted net earnings per share growth from continuing operations for the full year will be between plus 5% and plus 9%. The expectations regarding diluted net earnings per share includes acquisition-related cost and purchase accounting adjustments of approximately $0.07 to $0.10.","Turning to our commodities basket. We have approximately 80% of our total food spend contracted through the end of the calendar 2012 and 27% of our total spend contracted through the end of the fiscal year. We have not fully covered our usage through the fiscal year because we believe premiums for future contracts are simply too great given what we expect prices to be in the cash markets as we look forward. Food inflation in the first quarter was approximately 0.5%, with seafood deflation in the low-single digits and beef inflation in the low-double digits. For the fiscal year, our current expectation is that our commodities basket will see inflation in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%.","Category by category. Through the calendar year 2012, seafood costs are lower on a year-over-year basis, with 80% of our usage covered. Beef costs are higher on a year-over-year basis with 65% of our usage covered. Poultry costs are slightly higher on a year-over-year basis, with 100% of our usage covered. Wheat costs are lower on a year-over-year basis, with 100% of our usage covered. And dairy costs are lower on a year-over-year basis, with 65% of our usage covered. Our energy costs are expected to be favorable on a year-over-year basis, and we have contracted 40% of our natural gas and electricity in the deregulated markets in which we operate for calendar 2012.","And now I'll turn it over to Drew to comment on Red Lobster, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and the Specialty Restaurant Group.","Andrew H. Madsen","Thanks, Brad. We're pleased with the first quarter results across all of our brands. Olive Garden same-restaurant sales were modestly positive this quarter, up 0.3% versus prior year. Total sales growth was slightly more than 4%, and as Brad mentioned, operating profit increased on both a percentage and an absolute basis. Olive Garden started the quarter with the final 4 weeks of their Taste of Tuscany promotion, with a starting at $10.95 price point. And as we discussed last quarter, this particular promotion fell short of our expectations.","As we've discussed in the past, we've been developing new promotional constructs for Olive Garden during the past 3 quarters. In a further refined version, 2 Italian dinners for $25 began the last week of June. This promotion focused more single-mindedly on affordability, reinforced Olive Garden's brand positioning of generosity and value, and generated a strong improvement in same-restaurant sales and guest counts.","During the final 2 weeks of the quarter, Olive Garden featured our signature Never Ending Pasta Bowl promotion. Now after holding the price at $8.95 for the last 5 years, cumulative food and labor cost inflation over that period made the price increase to $9.95 appropriate, and we chose to take it this year. We believe $9.95 for unlimited soup or salad, plus endless combinations of pasta and sauce, is still a compelling offer and a great value. Just as importantly, however, taking a price increase now helps enable our broader strategy for the year, which is to feature compelling new promotion constructs with attractive price points more often this year, while also holding total pricing for the full year below 2%.","It's also worth noting that with the recent introduction of some generously portioned new appetizers, there was an increase in the number of guests at Olive Garden ordering appetizers instead of an entr\u00e9e for their meal. Given how we calculate check, that means that the first quarter menu mix reported for Olive Garden is overstated and guest counts are understated by roughly 100 basis points.","Now what we've seen at Olive Garden is consistent with guest behavior at some of our other brands as well and across the industry. We believe it reflects a combination of factors, including the growing guest need for greater affordability, guest interest in safe experimentation and guests' increasing interest in smaller portions, which some brands, including Bahama Breeze, are responding to with small plates or individual-sized versus shareable-sized appetizers. Now we see the increased guest interest in both of these options, generous appetizers that can substitute for entr\u00e9es and small plates, as opportunities for Olive Garden that we will address with upcoming menu enhancements over the next several quarters.","Again, as we discussed last quarter, we have adjusted Olive Garden's promotion strategy to feature more new value-oriented promotion constructs, like the 3-course meal for $12.95 during the third quarter last year and the 2 Italian dinners for $25 this quarter. And again, the price increase for Never Ending Pasta Bowl helped enable more of these value-oriented promotion constructs this year, as well as going forward.","At Olive Garden, we're also in the final stages of testing a new advertising campaign that puts a fresh face on the brand and more effectively ignites reconsideration from lapsed users. We still plan to introduce this new campaign later in the second quarter. In addition, as we have said before, at Olive Garden, we've been making changes to strengthen their core menu. Over the last few quarters, they've added several new entr\u00e9es that improve affordability and broaden choice and variety.","Over the next several quarters, Olive Garden plans to undertake a phased introduction of several new menu platforms that will further strengthen affordability, expand their selection of lighter choices, broaden dinner variety beyond their core pasta equity and increase the number of lunch-appropriate choices. Lastly, we're in the final stages at Olive Garden of validating a Via Tuscany! remodel design, featuring both interior and exterior transformations. We completed 18 of these remodels during the first quarter, and our plan is to begin an aggressive rollout later in the second half this year.","In terms of unit expansion, Olive Garden restaurants opened during the last 3 years continue to perform very strongly, and collectively have exceeded their earnings hurdle by more than 50%. We opened 5 new restaurants during the first quarter and remain on track to open 35 to 40 net new restaurants this year. So in summary, we believe the actions we've already taken at Olive Garden, plus the actions we're preparing to implement in the coming quarters, will help gradually position the business to regain its historical level of value leadership and consistently deliver competitively superior sales and earnings growth.","Red Lobster's same-restaurant sales declined 2.6% during the first quarter, although operating profit increased on both a percentage and absolute dollar basis due in part to lower seafood costs. As you recall, last year during the first quarter, Red Lobster delivered same-restaurant sales growth of 10.7% behind the introduction of their Four Course Seafood Feast promotion, and we're pleased that Red Lobster was able to hold on to the large majority of last year's growth this quarter and deliver a same-restaurant sales increase of slightly more than 8% on a 2-year basis.","During the first quarter, we adjusted the promotional cadence at Red Lobster versus prior year to focus on our most proven promotions and elevate the emphasis on affordable price certainty. We began the first quarter repeating last year's successful Four Course Seafood Feast promotion, which offers guests a complete 4-course seafood experience for $14.99. Red Lobster ran this promotion 3 weeks longer than last year.","The quarter concluded with 2 weeks of the brand's signature Endless Shrimp promotion, featuring a variety of shrimp preparations, including new teriyaki shrimp and new parmesan-crusted shrimp. This timing is 3 weeks earlier than the promotion started last year. To strengthen affordability, we reduced the price of Endless Shrimp from $15.99 last year to $14.99 this year. A majority of the negative menu mix at Red Lobster during August was driven by the earlier timing and lower price of Endless Shrimp.","During the second quarter, Red Lobster will introduce the most comprehensive core menu change at the brand in the last decade. We've been working on this menu transformation for approximately 2 years to ensure that it's compelling for guests, can be executed at a high level consistently by operations and contributes to profitable guest count growth. This new menu will offer significantly more items with approachable price points below $15. The menu will also help eliminate the veto vote by substantially increasing the number of non-seafood selections. We plan to support this menu introduction with national media that will help build awareness and generate incremental visits, especially from guests who have stopped coming to Red Lobster.","At Red Lobster, we remodeled 18 restaurants during the first quarter and are on track to complete more than 165 remodels this fiscal year. Remodeled restaurants continue to exceed their guest count and earnings growth hurdles.","LongHorn same-restaurant sales increased 3.6%, and total sales grew 12.7% during the first quarter. The strong first quarter same-restaurant sales results were supported by 2 promotions and the new lunch menu introduced in the second quarter of last year. At LongHorn, we began the quarter with 9 weeks of fire-grilled steaks, featuring a bacon-wrapped sirloin for $11.99 and a new fire-grilled flatiron steak at $12.99. We ended the quarter with 3 weeks of the brand's popular Steakhouse Dinner for Two at $29.99 promotion. This represents a 2-week earlier start for this promotion compared to last year to better align with the value-sensitive back-to-school season. Both promotions delivered solid same-restaurant sales and guest count growth.","As Brad mentioned, we also invested in additional national cable advertising support during the fire-grilled steaks promotion. In addition, roughly half of the negative menu mix at LongHorn during the first quarter is related to increased traffic at lunch, driven by their new lunch menu, which we view as a positive development and an opportunity for continued growth in the future.","While sales and guest count growth was strong this quarter, operating profit and margins fell compared to prior year, primarily because of significant beef cost inflation. We chose not to fully price for this inflation in order to ensure LongHorn retains a competitively strong position in the marketplace and protects the value proposition we offer guests.","During the second quarter, LongHorn plans to introduce several initiatives that will further differentiate the brand and help ensure continued profitable growth. These initiatives include 2 new bold and distinctive steak offerings, a new menu design that elevates their steak credentials, a new ad campaign that gives the brand more personality and attitude, and a new service platform that transitions the focus of restaurant teams from delivering on internally defined steps of service to achieving positive guest outcomes.","New LongHorn restaurants opened during the last 3 years continue to perform strongly, and collectively have exceeded their earnings hurdle by more than 30%. We opened 5 new LongHorn restaurants during the first quarter and remain on track to open 44 to 48 net new restaurants this year.","Now let me spend a moment to comment on the Specialty Restaurant Group. At the Specialty Restaurant Group, we had another strong quarter, with total sales of $163 million, which represents a 26% increase over the same quarter last year and 37% of Darden's overall sales growth. This growth was driven by solid same-restaurant sales increases of 4% at the Capital Grille, 1.2% at Bahama Breeze and 1.3% at Seasons 52, as well as the impact of 10 new restaurants in operations at these 3 brands compared to prior year, plus the addition of 11 Eddie V's Restaurants. In addition to delivering strong sales growth, the team also maintained effective cost controls, which has allowed restaurant-level margins to continue to expand.","The Specialty Restaurant Group has 2 key priorities this fiscal year: first, effectively manage accelerated growth while continuing to improve operational delivery and ensuring their brands stay relevant; and successfully integrating Yard House into the SRG portfolio. To support these priorities, the Specialty Restaurant Group is developing a strong pipeline of new restaurant locations and improving the way we open new restaurants, making it a more efficient and effective process. And the team is working closely with Darden's project management team, which is dedicated to seamlessly integrating Yard House into the Specialty Restaurant Group and into Darden.","In the second quarter, we plan to open 2 Capital Grille restaurants, 3 Seasons 52 restaurants, 1 Bahama Breeze and 1 Yard House.","Now I'll turn it over to Clarence.","Clarence Otis","Thanks, Drew. And so this was a solid start to our fiscal year. We're solid strategic, solid operationally, solid financially. At the enterprise level, we're making organizational changes, and we're making investments that will enable us to respond even more powerfully to what we see as important economic, demographic and lifestyle changes.","Of course, one of the most significant investments is our recent acquisition of Yard House. Yard House is an exciting brand. It has 40 restaurants today and ultimate unit potential of at least 150 to 200 restaurants. And Yard House also has a strong unit opening pipeline in place, with 4 openings planned for the rest of our fiscal 2013. Beyond Yard House, we believe our brands have the right strategies. And in a softer and more volatile environment than any of us would like, each is executing its strategy well while operating at a very high level on a day-to-day basis.","We're able to do all of this because we've got a winning culture with exceptional employees, employees who are committed to our business, committed to our guests. Our employees are why we remain on track to becoming a great company, and they're why we're excited about the future.","With that, we have about half an hour to take your questions. So let's get started. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Palmer from UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I was just wondering if we could go over Olive Garden in terms of your plans for the fiscal year. Just simply put, you have menu, marketing and reimaging. Could you just remind us of the timing of that? And when you think about these initiatives, as you've rolled them out in your -- previously, in other brands, how did you think about the effectiveness? And effectively, I'm just trying to figure out when you anticipate that brand perhaps getting more traction, which initiative will have the biggest impact.","Clarence Otis","Well, it's -- certainly, it's difficult to generalize by initiative, but I would say we're still on track to introduce a new advertising campaign that we think, as I mentioned, is going to be attention-getting and excite reconsideration of the brand. The impact of a new advertising campaign generally isn't immediate. It builds over time as the number of exposures and media weight behind that campaign builds over time. We plan to accelerate our reimaging, the remodel in the second half. That tends to be more immediate as guests notice a difference, and so that has a bit of a quicker impact than an advertising campaign would. Promotions, our promotion strategy is going to continue to be to emphasize these new value-oriented promotion constructs more frequently than we have in the past. And when we get a promotion that resonates with guests like the 2 for $25 did and like the 3-course meal in the third quarter last year did, that's a fairly immediate impact as well. In core menu, we've identified a number of opportunities where we believe the Olive Garden business is underdeveloped relative to the growth opportunity presented by the market and where that growth opportunity is consistent with the brand and our business model. But those new menu platforms are going to be phased in over several quarters, over the next 4 or 5 quarters, a platform a quarter potentially. Some of them could have a quicker impact, and some of them are going to build over time because the guest need state that we're addressing is going to build over time. So that's how we're thinking about revitalizing the Olive Garden business.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just as a quick follow-up to that, so there -- in terms of your -- those platforms you're talking about, I mean, with Red Lobster, you had the wood grilling. Are you talking that sort of a thing where you're getting sort of consistent with the brand, but a new type of direction where it's something different than what we have seen previously? Is that the sort of thing you're talking about?","Clarence Otis","Well, it's -- again, it's areas where we see that the Olive Garden business has opportunities to grow relative either to what we see in the industry today in terms of guest behavior and guest need states or things -- opportunities that we expect will take time, but will grow going forward. So I mentioned affordability. We think we can build more everyday affordability into the Olive Garden menu a couple of different ways, and we're going to be doing that. Lighter choices is another example. There is growing guest need for that now, but we think that's something that's going to build further as time goes on. Lunch is another opportunity where we can bring news at Olive Garden. It's a big strength for the business now, but we think we've got an opportunity to do better there. So those are the sorts of things specifically that we're focused on: affordability, lighter choices, expanding beyond pasta, adding some news at lunch. I mean, those are specifically the areas we're looking at.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Omohundro from Davenport & Company.","Jeffrey F. Omohundro - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","First question is on Yard House. Just wondering if there's any update to the dilution target this year and accretion in the out years and just anything further on your confidence on merger integration.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes. Jeff, this is Brad. And no, there's really no update to that. We're in the early phases of the integration right now, and we're really pleased with what we have and the strength of the business there. But there's no really new update to our expectations at this point.","Clarence Otis","And this is Clarence. And I would say, as Brad said, early stages, but we've done a lot of work. The integration process really started before the acquisition was completed and continues. And it begins, most importantly, with the team and making sure that we keep the talent that they've got, which has built such a great brand. We do continue to see the kind of sales and cost synergy opportunities that we identified when we laid out the original sort of guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I could go back to Olive Garden and the traffic weakness in August. I appreciate there was, I guess, a mix change. We have to look at both mix as well as traffic, but you also mentioned that you're raising the price on the Never Ending Pasta Bowl. But did that happen in August? Was there a relationship between the weaker traffic and the higher pricing? If it wasn't, then if you think -- at least, qualitatively looking into September, do you worry or do you have confidence that the higher price won't disrupt traffic in the brand?","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, there's a few dynamics going on in August. First, industry slowed down overall. Second, the menu mix that we saw at Olive Garden in terms of guests ordering more appetizers instead of entr\u00e9es started at the end of last fiscal year, but really accelerated in August, particularly due to some new appetizers that we introduced in July. And then third, Never Ending Pasta Bowl at the higher price point did start at the end of August, and it's possible, with the higher price point, that some of the more value-sensitive guests were impacted by that price. But it's going to enable us to do some important things over the rest of the year in terms of offering value and affordability more broadly throughout the year.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Do you have a sense -- at this point, is that mix shift or -- downward or the traffic shift down because the higher prices stabilized? Or is it the kind of thing that could -- you're worried about negatively surprising you in the current quarter, given that you haven't moved that price, what, in 5 years and it is a value-oriented promotion, and you've got regular customers and maybe they don't come back again? How confident are you that you got that right, I guess, was my question.","Clarence Otis","Yes, we think we're pretty confident that we got it right. We think it's important to not -- to make sure that a single offer doesn't become an anchor that precludes us from offering the kind of affordability across the entire year and on a go-forward basis that we need to offer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just to continue on that line of questions, can you talk about your comment about Olive Garden profitability being up meaningfully? Are you back to where you were before the fall-off you experienced in 2012? And can you talk about the sustainability of the meaningful improvement, especially in light of your intent to promote more and recent renewed wheat inflation?","C. Bradford Richmond","Well, the way we think about Olive Garden, in the quarter, operating profit and margins were up, which we feel very good about. And as we think about the business more holistically, we think it's in a very strong financial position. So restaurant margins for the business are very strong, and that's one of the key drivers that's enabling new restaurant growth to continue to perform at a very high level, like I said, on average exceeding their sales and earnings targets by more than 50% over the last 3 years. Now we haven't gotten back, obviously, all of the traffic over the last 3 years, but we are building back.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And shifting to Red Lobster, a quick question there. You talked about the menu overhaul being the biggest change in, I think, 10 years, which sounds like a risky proposition. So maybe you could talk a bit about the extent of testing you did in market or behind the scenes to ensure that nothing you've changed will alienate some of your existing loyal customer base.","Andrew H. Madsen","Well, it is a big change. And you're absolutely right that we need to be careful with it to make sure that it's broadly satisfying to guests and that operationally that we can execute it, and that's why we've been working on it for 2 years. More specifically, we've been testing it in somewhere between 40 and 50 restaurants spread geographically across the country for almost a year. And based on that learning, we've been refining recipes, we've been refining the amount of change to the menu and how we sequence that change into our restaurants. And what we've seen -- and I guess, to dimensionalize it a little bit more, we talk about items under $15 addressing the need for more everyday affordability, and so the menu is going to go from having about 40% of the entr\u00e9es being under $15 to about 60% of the entr\u00e9es being under $15. We talk about the veto vote, whereas we have seafood expertise, but if not everyone in the party wants seafood at Red Lobster, historically that could have been a challenge. So the menu is now going from roughly 8% of items being non-seafood to about 25% of the items being non-seafood. And what we've seen in test market is good guest satisfaction and guest count growth over that time period, and so we're very encouraged by what we see. But it is a big change, and that's why we've been evaluating it very carefully over a pretty extended time period.","Clarence Otis","This is Clarence, and I would say the bigger risk -- given the kind of dynamic change that we're seeing in the consumer set, when you look at economic condition, when you look at demographics, the biggest risk would be to not change. So we must change, and we have to do that in a smart way, as Drew said, with appropriate testing. And Red Lobster, we think, has done that. It's done it over 2 years. It's why, as Drew said, when we look at Olive Garden, we're introducing platforms in a staged way because testing on some of those platforms is much farther ahead than it is on others. But again, we think that the risk in a changing environment is to not change.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So when I look at the operating model of this system, as far as the quarter goes, I think it was pretty impressive, the amount of leverage that you're able to get on the labor line and the other expense line within the 4 walls of your restaurant base and really, on a slightly negative overall comp. And the analysis I do says that basically per store, your labor costs were down 3% and per store, your other restaurant expenses were down 4%. So I'm just trying to figure out what exactly you're doing to manage the costs this effectively. And really how sustainable are these cost trends and this margin leverage? Is this a one quarter thing? Or are we going to continue to see this?","Clarence Otis","Well, I would say just a couple of things. We've talked over the last several years about the fact that we've been undertaking some fairly significant transformation in terms of how we do business in some important high-spend areas. And so we're certainly benefiting from the steps that we've taken on that side, and there's continued benefit as we go forward. The other thing that matters is inflation, and sometimes there are headwinds like there was last year with seafood. Seafood is a little bit more of a tailwind this year, although some of that is mitigated by beef headwinds. And so all of that is part of it, but we think that the transformative changes that we've made are permanent, steady-state changes that we'll continue to benefit from.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And you talked about, based on the way that your accounting works, that your seafood -- the lower seafood costs are going to be more beneficial in the second quarter. So should we expect cost of sales margins to be down 10, 20, 30, 40 basis points from the first quarter in the second quarter?","C. Bradford Richmond","This is Brad, and what I would say is the average cost system means that we're blending in newer purchases with the inventory that we have, so there's somewhat of a lag effect to, in this case, the downward prices on many of these items. And so if that continues as we would expect, you should see costs of sales that are slightly more favorable in the second quarter vis-\u00e0-vis last year than they were in the first quarter just because of the accounting dynamics going on there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 questions. One, I guess, broadly I'm just wondering whether you can talk about the casual dining environment, which has obviously been choppy. I'm wondering how you would describe it relative to both sentiment and -- well, consumer sentiment as well as the competitive landscape. I think you mentioned there was a slowing in August. Just wondering whether you're seeing anything on either front that gives what you -- what seems to be greater confidence on the fiscal '13 outlook. And then just as a follow-up on the commodity cost side, in the first quarter, it looks like food costs as a percentage of sales are relatively flat. You mentioned something about promotional pricing strategy. I'm just wondering whether you attribute that relatively flat cost of sales to the more aggressive discounting, perhaps. And I think you're now saying the basket for fiscal '13 is back to kind of the 0.5% to 1.5% inflation. I think you previously talked about the low end. So just how you think about that overall food basket would be helpful.","Clarence Otis","And I'll start. Just on the consumer side, as we talked about fiscal '13 back in June, I think what we said was we thought it would look a lot, from a macroeconomic environment, like our fiscal 2012. And to the extent that there was -- as you looked at the balance of risk, '13 versus '12, it was probably to the downside, and so that's how we established our plans. Nothing has really changed from that perspective. When you get to the end result for the entire year of fiscal 2012, what you saw is it bounced around from quarter-to-quarter and month-to-month to get there, and we think that, that will be the case in 2013. The year has certainly started that way, and so no new news there. And we think the bounciness -- the overall result for the year reflects fundamentals. The bouncing around reflects sentiment.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, and this is Brad. Just a little bit on the food cost basket side, from where we started the fiscal year to where we are now, we've got 80% coverage on our food costs to the remainder of the calendar year, so we feel pretty good about that. If you look at what we were wrapping on last year, in the first quarter, we had about 8% year-over-year cost inflation and about the same in the second quarter, and that moderated as we got into the back half of the year. And so we feel pretty good where that is, being in that 0.5% to 1.5% range. I think early in the year, we said that we're probably at the lower end of that. I'd say now we're probably in the middle half of that range, given our cost basket and how we see the outlook and what we've got contracted. We don't see a dramatic change from the start of the fiscal year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Buckley of Bank of America.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to the comments about media weights and maybe the impact of the final 2 weeks in August at both Olive Garden and Red Lobster from kind of opposite pricing moves in your key promotions. So the fact that you have heavier weights in the first quarter and I guess an extra flight at LongHorn, what happens for the balance of the year on a year-over-year basis? And again, if you could talk a little bit about that last 2-week impact at both Olive Garden and Red Lobster, yes, I guess, particularly the traffic number at Olive Garden, if that was affected. You commented briefly, but again, a little bit more detail on the pricing of Never Ending Pasta Bowl.","Andrew H. Madsen","So starting with the media weight, the biggest drivers -- the 2 biggest drivers of the media weight increase in the first quarter was media inflation and then the addition of another flight of network cable advertising at LongHorn under their first promotion. For the rest of it, there was not a meaningful change. There was a modest change at Olive Garden and Red Lobster, driven largely by when the promotion started, but not as significant a change as at LongHorn. And as we look over the balance of the year, all the brands have strong media weight equal to or slightly above prior year. So we think we've got substantial media weight to deliver the news and the messaging that we need to going forward. But then back to Olive Garden, in August, there was -- as I said, when you look at the traffic and the same-restaurant sales number, there were a few things going on. So the industry did drop, our estimate, by probably about 1 point. Second thing, for the quarter, we think there was about a 100 basis point impact on traffic versus check related to ordering appetizers instead of an entr\u00e9e. And that was, for the quarter, much higher in August than it was for the quarter because we introduced some new appetizers in July and you could see the menu mix change much more in August as a result. And then third, it's difficult to precisely determine the impact of a dollar increase in price of a promotion on traffic. We do know that higher prices by themselves are probably, over time, going to have a downward impact on traffic for some guests on some occasions. We might have seen some of that at Olive Garden in the month. But as we also said, we think that it was an appropriate move to make because we'd held that price for 5 years and the higher price is now going to put us in a position to do the things that we need to do more broadly over the next 3 quarters this year and into next year in terms of offering new promotional constructs that communicate everyday value more consistently.","C. Bradford Richmond","Brad here. Just one thing I would add is in the first quarter, SG&A were up about 130 basis points. About 1\/3 of that was the media and inflation was half of that. So if you look out through the year, I mean, we're going to see about a similar number for the whole year. So it's not like we pulled media forward that's going to be sacrificed in a later quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Barish of Jefferies.","Andrew M. Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Wondering if you guys can opine on the strength in the casual steak category. Obviously, your own LongHorn business, performing well, but competitors doing well also. Is it maybe something to do with high beef prices in the -- at the retail grocery market level? Or what do you think is going on category-wise that continues to drive customers?","Andrew H. Madsen","Well, I mean, we have some beliefs, so you have to take them as a point of view on this, as opposed to factual. Well, there are some facts. So one of the facts is that chains are taking share from independents at a much more rapid rate in the steak category than in casual dining overall. And a lot of that has to do with the advantages that chains have when it comes to being able to offer the kind of cuts that they offer at prices really that independents find it difficult to match. We believe another part of it is that consumers are less inclined to have their steak occasions at home and put those occasions at risk, given how much steak costs. And so they're probably having more away-from-home steak occasions. So there's some shift going on there as well. So we think those are 2 big factors. And then yes, the final piece would be that the growing steak chains are all doing a very good job of delivering the experience, we think, led by LongHorn. But we think you've seen significant improvement operationally at Outback, and Texas Roadhouse and Logan's Roadhouse both do a good job as well.","Andrew M. Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one quick numbers question on interest expense for this fiscal year maybe versus fiscal '12. Just give us a sense of where that's heading with the Yard House deal, but then the debt pay down focus going forward.","C. Bradford Richmond","Interest expense, obviously, we're taking on more debt with the Yard House acquisition and you just mentioned paying down the debt. So it is going to be up to last year, but probably in that, say, 8% to 12% higher than the prior year.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, a follow-up and then a separate question. I think it was Brian that asked about labor costs. That obviously did very well in the first quarter, especially given the comp. And wherever costs have been -- I mean, with the numbers that I'm looking at, I mean, we're down every quarter in 2012 as well relative to 2011. So just a follow-up to that question is, will we continue to see year-on-year declines in labor costs for the rest of 2013? Or was that just a one-quarter event? I don't know if I caught the answer. And then a separate question, if I may, as well.","Clarence Otis","It's paging through, there's no typical [ph]...","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes. As we look through labor costs, and again, Clarence touched some on this, just the more longer-term nature that of initiatives we had against that plus our tools around guest count, forward testing, labor management. We would expect to continue to see year-over-year improvement on the restaurant labor line, maybe not as great as it was in the first quarter. But obviously, a key thing for us is growing same-restaurant sales. It's -- that line is pretty heavily leveraged. So to the degree we have more success there, we could have even more success from the restaurant labor line. But what we see in the first quarter is success that we expect to achieve in the remaining quarters of the year, but maybe not as at high a level.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And that, I think, is a good follow-up to the next question. I would assume that the new -- bet the new menus at Red Lobster, the new menus at Olive Garden bear negative mix. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong in that way, in that you're giving consumers an opportunity to spend less. I mean there might be some other factors there that it's not the case, but you can explain that. And so what I just basically wanted to get a sense is, if there is that negative mix, are the new items designed to be gross profit dollar neutral to the higher-priced items? And if it is gross profit dollar negative, how much traffic do you need, from a profit perspective, to offset the potential for negative mix, if you're prepared to talk about that?","Clarence Otis","Yes. So those are dynamics we are looking at very carefully, obviously, over the last year when we were testing this new menu in market at Red Lobster. And what we've seen is a pretty modest check decline related to the new entr\u00e9es that we're adding that are more affordable. That modest decline is partly offset by an increase in appetizers because there's a broader range of appetizers on this new menu, and we've talked about the dynamic earlier about some guests ordering appetizers instead of an entr\u00e9e. And then the rest of the check impact is offset by guest count growth and some labor optimization that we've put in place. So what we would expect to see isn't a big decline in check, probably a slower growing check, improving guest count growth that's driving growth in total sales and total earnings. And that's kind of the dynamic overall that we're seeing in the test.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion from Citi.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just wanted to ask, historically, what have you seen in terms of sales lift from major new core menu changes at Olive Garden and Red Lobster?","Andrew H. Madsen","Most of the new menus that we've done in the last several years have been 3 or 4 new items to replace just to add news and variety, and we don't typically track a guest count lift directly with those new menu introductions. This core menu at Red Lobster is different. It's much more comprehensive, and it is having a bigger impact on the business. I don't think we want to talk about, specifically, the traffic lift that we saw in the test market at this stage, other than to say we did see traffic improvement and we did see improvement in sales and earnings overall.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's great to hear. And with the early launch of Endless Shrimp, I mean, how should we think about that in terms of its impact to next quarter's same-store sales? I mean, do you believe that the new menu will more than offset that early launch?","Andrew H. Madsen","That's a big question. But what I would say is obviously, the launch weeks are a little bit stronger. But Endless is a great promotion for Red Lobster, great guest appeal, and so there shouldn't be a dramatic impact from there. But as you touched on, the menu introduction and how quickly that resonates with guests and that they come in and enjoy, that's probably going to be a bigger driving factor for second quarter same-restaurant sales performance at Red Lobster.","Operator","Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could please update us on your funding plans for Yard House in your October debt maturity at this point. It looks like you put a term loan in place last month.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, in terms of our funding expectations and plans that we've done is, over the past 3 months, we have put in place a private offering that we did that took down our CP balance pretty much to 0. And then -- so we paid for the purchase of the Yard House out of our revolver amount that we had available to us there, and then just recently, we have initiated a term loan with a number of our banks that has a delayed funding feature to that. So that's available to us as we move into the future here. And then to your point, we do have debt maturity coming this October, and so we're evaluating that right now, but would anticipate most likely going back to the public markets to refinance that debt around the time that it matures.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason West at Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just going back to some of the menu changes that are upcoming. You mentioned at Red Lobster, it's sort of a more holistic menu change, but at Olive Garden, it's more phasing in some new platforms and promotions. And just wondering, is that sort of the permanent step you're taking at Olive Garden to address some of the traffic issues there? Or is there plans for a bigger, more comprehensive menu relaunch later this year, similar to what you're doing at Red Lobster?","Clarence Otis","It's Clarence, and I'll start. And so when Drew talks about introducing new platforms at Olive Garden and phasing those in over the next 3 to 4 quarters, at the end of that period, the cumulative effect of that menu change will equal Red Lobster. Perhaps it will even be a little bit bigger. And so we're talking about a fairly significant change to the Olive Garden menu, which we think is appropriate. And the reason why it's happening in those stages is so we can make sure that we test each stage appropriately, but the net effect is a very significant change. Beyond that, we've talked about some of the other things that we're doing around changing promotional constructs; advertising, which will hit this year; and then the reimaging, which will really accelerate in the second half of this year and will reach a critical mass pretty quickly into next fiscal year, yes.","C. Bradford Richmond","And, Andy, Brad Richmond here. I wanted to come back on your question about interest rate. Still integrating, so working off a number of pieces of documents here, but interest for us on a year-over-year basis, with the Yard House acquisition, is probably going to be in that 18% to 22%. The number I gave you earlier was on a pre-acquisition basis. So let me clarify that for you.","Matthew Stroud","Thanks, Brad. That's all the time we have for this morning. I know there are still several of you that are in queue. We apologize that we couldn't get to your questions. Of course, we'll be here in Orlando throughout the day to take your calls.

Today\u2019s discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation.

","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. As you\u2019ve seen from our press release, we\u2019re off to a solid start to our fiscal 2018. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.9 billion, an increase of 12.9%. Same restaurant sales grew 1.7% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.99, an increase of 12.5% from last year\u2019s diluted net earnings per share. I\u2019m pleased with our same restaurant sales growth of 1.7% considering the overall industry performance along with the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which Rick will quantify during his remarks. ","Olive Garden\u2019s business remained strong. Same restaurant sales grew 1.9% and we were pleased with these results, particularly given a change to the marketing calendar which resulted in one less promotion in the quarter. These results outperformed the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 490 basis points. This was Olive Garden\u2019s 12th consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth. Olive Garden continues to maintain a significant gap to the industry as we drive frequency among our most loyal guests. Our core menu and promotional strategy are successfully working together to create value, and our restaurant operators\u2019 focus on flawless execution of the basics continues to drive all-time high guest satisfaction scores.","Convenience remains a focus area. We\u2019re making meaningful progress, improving our to-go processes to handle increased volume, enhancing IT support, and redesigning our to-go stations to improve the guest experience. Overall, to-go sales increased 12% in the quarter. In addition, we ran our Buy One Take One promotion during the quarter, which guests view as the ultimate convenience. ","Longhorn Steakhouse had a solid quarter. Same restaurant sales grew 2.6%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 560 points. This was Longhorn\u2019s 18th consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth. The investments we have been making in our food and service over the last two years are contributing to industry-leading guest satisfaction scores, which is driving our outperformance. Additionally, we are seeing strong same restaurant sales growth in our newer markets as guests discover Longhorn\u2019s value proposition. This upward sales trend in newer markets is consistent with past performance of the brand.","The Longhorn team is relentlessly focused on enhancing the guest experience. We will continue to invest in food quality, look for additional ways to simplify operations, and leverage Longhorn\u2019s unique culture to enable strong sales growth. ","Turning to Cheddar\u2019s, we continue to make good progress on the integration. The planning process is behind us and we are now focused on execution. We are making significant non guest-facing changes over the next year which we know will have an impact on our restaurant teams. It will take time for the restaurant managers and team members to familiarize themselves with our systems and processes. I\u2019m confident they will master these new tools, which will help improve performance over time.","Same restaurant sales for the quarter outperformed the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, but declined 1.4%. Cheddar\u2019s is heavily penetrated in Texas, and they were impacted more by Hurricane Harvey than Darden overall. Also, during the quarter we exercised our right of first refusal to acquire the 11 restaurants owned by the Cheddar\u2019s franchisee in Georgia as well as the development rights they held for Cheddar\u2019s in Georgia and Alabama. This transaction, which closed on August 28, gives us the opportunity to enhance our presence in two states that we believe will have strong growth opportunities for the Cheddar\u2019s brand.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Rick.","Rick Cardenas","Thank you, Gene, and good morning everyone. Total sales grew 12.9% this quarter driven by 11.2% growth from the addition of 141 Cheddar\u2019s and other new restaurants and same restaurant sales growth of 1.7%. First quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.99, an increase of 12.5% from last year\u2019s earnings per share. We also returned approximately $180 million of capital to our shareholders with $100 million in share repurchases and approximately $80 million in dividends. ","Looking at our results in the first quarter, it\u2019s important to note that Hurricane Harvey made landfall on the last weekend of our quarter. The day before Harvey made landfall in Texas, same restaurant sales quarter-to-date were running plus 2%, 30 basis points higher than where we ended the quarter. This sales impact along with other Harvey-related costs negatively affected first quarter EPS by approximately $0.015. ","Now turning to the P&L, let me comment on profit margins before delving deeper into each line item. Restaurant level EBITDA margin was equal to last year\u2019s results. Adjusted EBIT margin was 10 basis points lower, driven by asset sale gains last year of $8 million, which we categorize in the impairments of disposal of assets line, and the addition of Cheddar\u2019s, which I will refer to as brand mix, impacted EBIT margin unfavorably by approximately 40 basis points in the first quarter versus last year. Over time, we expect this brand mix impact to be closer to 20 basis points as we move past integration and fully capture synergies. As a reminder, we expect to have between $22 million and $27 million of run rate synergies and expect to achieve this run rate by the end of fiscal 2019. Excluding the headwinds from last year\u2019s gain on asset sales and the brand mix impact of Cheddar\u2019s, EBIT margins expanded approximately 70 basis points in the quarter. ","Now on to the expense detail, food and beverage costs were favorable by 10 basis points as pricing of approximately 1.5% and cost savings more than offset commodity cost inflation. Restaurant labor was unfavorable by 40 basis points compared to last year due to brand mix and wage inflation that was at the high end of our expected range of 3% to 4%. Restaurant expenses as a percent of sales were equal to last year despite a headwind of 10 basis points in pre-opening expenses. Marketing expenses were favorable by 30 basis points due to brand mix and the promotional shift at Olive Garden that Gene mentioned. Finally, G&A was favorable by 40 basis points due to quarterly timing and sales leverage.","Sales increased in every segment, driven by same restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden, Longhorn, and the fine dining segment, and by the addition of Cheddar\u2019s to the other business segment. This sales growth drove strong segment profit margins particularly at Olive Garden, where segment profit margin was 20.1%, 70 basis points higher than last year. However, our other business segment profit margin was 200 basis points lower than last year due to two things: the addition of Cheddar\u2019s to the segment, which altered segment profit margin mix, and moving consumer packaged goods out of the Other segment beginning this fiscal year, which reduced this segment\u2019s margin by roughly 100 basis points. The primary beneficiary of this shift was Olive Garden with a 20 basis point improvement in their margins.","This morning, we also reaffirmed our full-year fiscal 2018 outlook. This outlook includes the expected impact of Hurricane Irma, which was in our second quarter. We anticipate the impact of Hurricane Irma to be approximately double the first quarter impact of Hurricane Harvey in terms of both same restaurant sales and profit impacts. For fiscal 2018, we anticipate adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.38 to $4.50, total sales growth of 11.5% to 13% including sales from all Cheddar\u2019s restaurants and same restaurant sales growth of between 1% and 2% for the full fiscal year.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Gene for some closing remarks.","Gene Lee","Thanks Rick. I want to take a moment to thank the teams in both our restaurants and our restaurant support center that have worked tirelessly over the past month dealing with Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana and Hurricane Irma in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. Both storms had a devastating impact on numerous communities that are home to our guests, team members and restaurants. In the field, our restaurant teams did a tremendous job of getting our restaurants that had to close back open again, and our teams here at the support center provided outstanding support before, during and after the storm hit. This ensured we were prepared to deal with the impact operationally while helping our team members in need and the communities we serve. ","Additionally, our thoughts go out to the citizens of Puerto Rico and Mexico City, as well as our franchise partners in these communities, who are still dealing with the impacts of Hurricane Maria and the earthquake that took place last week.","I am very proud of the response from everyone across Darden. Moments like these, as difficult as they are, highlight the strength of our culture and what makes our people, our restaurants and our brand so special. ","With that, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question is coming from Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank. Brett, your line is now open.","Brett Levy","Good morning. Would you be able to share a little bit more detail on what you\u2019re seeing across the competitive landscape, whether it be from direct casual diners, QSR, people who are getting more into the delivery world as well as just at-home players? Do you have any thoughts on why Olive Garden put up an astonishingly good number still, if not quite up the market share gains you\u2019ve seen in recent quarters? Do you think that\u2019s the result of promotional cadence? Just lastly, what are your thoughts on pricing for the rest of the year? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Okay, good morning, Brett. There\u2019s seven questions, I think, in there, but great way to frame that up as one question. Let me start with Olive Garden, because I think that\u2019s where everybody wants me to start, then I\u2019ll make some comments on the overall environment.","I\u2019m super excited about the quarter we put up in Olive Garden. I think the focus ought to be on the improvement in margins. I thought we had sales growth. We ran one less promotion during the quarter, which in our effort to simplify our operations we thought was a really smart move. It eliminates one all-team meeting, it eliminated bringing in extra product. We\u2019re lengthening the time we run our promotions. We\u2019re trying to re-energize them during the middle of the promotion. I thought it was incredibly effective.","We had a lot less targeted digital incentives in the marketplace. We made a major change to our strongest traffic driver, which is soup, salad, and breadsticks at $5.99, and we moved that to $6.99 which drove less traffic, however was significantly more profitable. So I think everybody needs to focus on the 7% growth in operating income in Olive Garden at a segment profit level, just absolutely impressive when you think about the size of this system and the performance of the overall category.","The other thing I\u2019d add on the Olive Garden is the traffic gap was greater than the sales gap as we continued to under-price inflation and we think we\u2019re under-pricing our competitors to improve value. Lastly on Olive Garden, I would just say that the team is doing an incredible job. They\u2019re just running better restaurants today - our throughput is up, our satisfaction is up, our engagement with team members is up. So when I put this quarter in perspective for Olive Garden, it was short of a target that the analyst community put out there, but we didn\u2019t put that sales target out there, and if you take the last three days out of the quarter, we would have been at 2%, so I\u2019m thrilled.","As far as the overall environment goes, it was a choppy quarter. We had a lot of activity around storms, we had a holiday switch with the Fourth of July - just a lot of noise in the quarter. I would say the environment feels fairly good. The consumer is there with the right offer. Value has never been more important and value, depending on where you play and where your price point is, can be derived through different things. I think at Longhorn, we\u2019re deriving value with increasing the quality and improving our service; Olive Garden, we\u2019re playing a little bit more around with price to get that value across, so I think people are offering strong value consistently and provide it every day. I go back to looking at our Olive Garden menu at lunch - all the price points are $6.99, $7.99, $8.99, $9.99, and I believe that we\u2019ve got great value out there with an abundance in portion. ","As far as pricing, Rick, I think that you can answer the pricing question.","Rick Cardenas","Yes, and let me clarify one other point. Gene mentioned Olive Garden would have been at 2%. Actually, Olive Garden would have been at 2.2% without the hurricane, so strong first quarter for Olive Garden.","In terms of pricing, we had 1.5% pricing this quarter, and as we\u2019ve said before, we want to continue to maintain our value leadership position and price, and using our scale and our advantages to be able to price below our competitors and price below inflation when appropriate. This year, we expect to price between 1% and 2%, and we\u2019re solid in the middle of that right now.","Brett Levy","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is now open.","Brian Bittner","Thanks, good morning guys. One for Gene, one for Rick. Gene, you\u2019ve started to talk a lot more about Darden in general as a platform company that has the strength to make more accretive acquisitions to create shareholder value going forward. Our math suggests by the end of this fiscal year \u201918, you would easily have the capital ability to acquire something over a billion dollars if you so wanted. I know you\u2019re really laser focused on integrating cheddar\u2019s, but how do you think about this strategy going forward and potential timing of doing something else? ","Gene Lee","Brian, I think about it very sequentially, and right now you\u2019re right- we are laser focused on integrating Cheddar\u2019s. We think Cheddar\u2019s is an incredible opportunity for long-term growth, and so we are not even contemplating or thinking about doing anything else until that brand is fully integrated, it is firing and has really a good growth platform where it\u2019s contributing at a much higher growth rate than Olive Garden and to add to our overall growth rate, so that\u2019s the focus. Once we have visibility that that has been done successfully, then we\u2019ll look at the platform and determine what our next move is.","Brian Bittner","Okay, and just for Rick, following up on that pricing question, you have said you were going to price closer to the 1% range. You were at 1.5% this quarter. Should we expect that to fall down towards the 1% range, and you held restaurant margins flat this quarter, would that make that more challenging? And if you have any initial thoughts on Hurricane Irma, that would be helpful as well. ","Rick Cardenas","Yes Brian, the 1.5% we did say we\u2019d be at the lower end of the 1% to 2%, so 1.5% is kind of at the high end of the low end. We still think somewhere in the 1.5-ish range is where we\u2019ll end up for the year, but between 1 to 2%. It all depends on what we see in commodities and other things, but we also took most of our pricing already, so unless we take other pricing actions, we should be done with our pricing for the year.","In terms of Irma, as I mentioned on the remarks, we expect the impact of Hurricane Irma to be double the impact of Hurricane Harvey; and remember, Hurricane Harvey was about 30 basis points in comps and $0.015 in EPS, so think six points in comps and $0.03 in EPS. I\u2019d like to remind everybody that we kept our earnings guidance right where we said at the beginning of the year, so we\u2019ve really kind of eaten $0.045 in this guidance.","Brian Bittner","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Will, your line is now open.","Will Slabaugh","Yes, thanks guys. I had a question on the Olive Garden to-go business. That\u2019s been growing at a pretty rapid clip for a while now. Can you talk about where you are in that growth evolution, if you will, and if you think these consistent improvements that you\u2019re making--you know, you mentioned a few including packaging, etc. earlier, that you\u2019re making can keep that business growing at a double-digit rate in the future.","Gene Lee","Yes, you know, we saw a good 12% growth in the quarter on a four-year run rate of approximately 70%. We are starting to really think about this as a separate kind of business. Dave and the team are making some great changes. We think technology can continue to help. We know in our higher volume restaurants that we need to build more space to handle the volume, and we\u2019ve done a few of those remodels with a lot of success. As long as the consumer demand is there for this product, I think we can grow it, continue to grow it close to double digits.","Now, when the percentages are--it\u2019s getting harder to grow at double digits because the denominator is much higher than what it was when we first started, but I still think this is a growth driver for us. The consumer satisfaction of our to-go product is extremely high, and that\u2019s one thing that our team is really, really focused on, is how do we make the experience better for the consumer, and the repeat business and the loyalty inside a to-go is also very high.","Will Slabaugh","Got it. If I could just follow up to that, can you talk about the learnings that you\u2019ve gotten from Olive Garden with that to-go business, realizing that Italian simply just carries better than most other forms of food, but is there any learnings you can take and translate into other businesses and if there is a big growth opportunity you see in to-go in any other concepts that you have?","Gene Lee","Yes, I think to-go is growing organically in the other businesses because the consumer wants it. However, the big opportunity for to-go in Olive Garden is the bulk meals and being able to do a tray of lasagna or a pan of fettuccine Alfredo. We just don\u2019t have that. We have a little bit of that in Bahama Breeze - we\u2019ve got some products that we do some large party stuff on, but we really think about the other mass brand, Olive Garden. It\u2019s really growing with the consumer demand and it\u2019s a nice piece of business, but it will never have the same opportunity as Olive Garden does because of the bulk size and really the business piece.","Will Slabaugh","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from David Tarantino from Baird. David, your line is now open.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. Gene, I wanted to ask you to clarify your comments on the Cheddar\u2019s integration. It sounds like--I think you mentioned that it\u2019s going to take some time for the team to familiarize themselves with your systems and processes, so could you maybe give us an update on how you think that\u2019s going so far and whether that comment was meant to imply that this is maybe proving a little more difficult than you thought originally?","Gene Lee","No, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not proving more difficult. We knew that this--we knew that this had been under-invested in and that the systems were lacking, that there wasn\u2019t much to work with, and so in our past acquisitions we\u2019ve had to change systems, here we\u2019re implementing systems that never were there, which makes it a little bit different. But when you think about the magnitude of this and none of the integration has really started - it\u2019s starting in the next couple weeks for the most part, all-new distribution, food, small wares. We\u2019ve got a new HR system that\u2019s going in the first of the year, we\u2019ve got an all-new POS that\u2019s starting to go in. Every back office system is going to be new. These restaurants don\u2019t have KDS. Seventy percent of the restaurants still have a ticket, just one ticket coming into the kitchen, they don\u2019t even have remote printers. I haven\u2019t worked in an environment where we haven\u2019t had remote printers since the 1980s, so there\u2019s a lot of work to be done here.","We\u2019ve got great management out there, it\u2019s just a lot for them to take in, and we know through our past history with integrations that these become distractions and you\u2019re not as focused on the basics of the business. So I\u2019m pleased with where we\u2019re at, there\u2019s just a lot of work to do. ","David Tarantino","Got it. Does your guidance for the year assume that you don\u2019t make progress on improving comps from where they are, or maybe even take a step backwards? How are you thinking about the business performance as you make this transition?","Gene Lee","Yes, our guidance anticipates the performance the way they\u2019re performing right now and the synergies we\u2019ve already talked about. ","David, one other thing and for everybody on Cheddar\u2019s is that we are doing multiple integrations. As you remember, they purchased their largest franchisee prior to us purchasing them, which is making that part of it more complicated. We are also in Cheddar\u2019s starting to run negative check average as we standardize the menus across the system, and we believe this is--this was not something in our calculus, but we think this is the right thing to do for the business, is to standardize all these menus and processes and procedures. The largest franchisee that we acquired, what we refer to as the Grier restaurants, are running negative check because of this standardization.","David Tarantino","Great, that\u2019s helpful. If I could squeeze one more in, did you quantify the impact of having one less promotion at Olive Garden this quarter on the comps?","Gene Lee","No. We actually--we don\u2019t think that that had a major impact on it. We do think the lack of TDIs may have had an impact on the top line, but it significantly helped the bottom line.","David Tarantino","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is now open.","Karen Holthouse","Hi. Another one on Olive Garden. The dynamic that we did see this quarter with less promotion, less marketing expense but beneficial to profits, maybe a little bit of a traffic headwind from the change in soup, salad and bread stick pricing, is that how to think about things going forward, or when do you think you get to a little bit more of a normal run rate of the level of promotion that you want to be at?","Gene Lee","I think that\u2019s dynamic. I think that we look at having a toolkit of levers that we can pull, depending on what\u2019s happening in the external environment and maybe good our top line promotional activity is. Just a reminder to everybody, we\u2019re out there with three levels of media - we\u2019ve got a promotional media message, we have a secondary message out there, and then we have a lunch or a catering business, the business-type message out there. We continue to transition to more online video as we learn more about that and we become more effective, and so we\u2019re going to continue to play with the media mix to try to optimize traffic and profitability, but it is dependent on what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. That\u2019s what we really love about the Olive Garden business, is that we have a lot of levers to pull. ","As we think about going forward, everything is factored into our guidance.","Karen Holthouse","Then one quick one on the commodity outlook. Beef inflation or beef deflation went from mid single digits to low single digits for the year. As we\u2019re thinking about the cadence of that through the year, does that actually imply getting back to inflation by the end of the year?","Gene Lee","On the beef front, no, not necessarily. As we mentioned at the beginning of the year, we still expect commodity inflation to be between flat and 1%, and based on where we are today, we still think that number makes sense.","Karen Holthouse","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. John, your line is now open. ","Chris","It\u2019s actually Chris on for John, so thanks for the color so far. Wanted to ask a little bit more about the full-year guide. So quantifying the impact from both of the hurricanes, it\u2019s about $0.045, but I just wanted to ask if there were an potential offsets or strengthening of the business that you\u2019ve been seeing recently to help offset that impact (indiscernible) reaffirm today.","Gene Lee","Yes, that\u2019s all included in the guidance. We\u2019ve taken in what\u2019s happened in the last couple weeks and included that in the guidance going forward.","Chris","But just in terms of your confidence in the guide to help offset that $0.045?","Gene Lee","You know, as we think about what we guided, we feel really confident in the 438 to 450 that we mentioned. As we see more of what\u2019s been going on with the hurricanes and the impact that we said the hurricanes have, including cost saves that we\u2019re doing for the year, we feel really good about the 438 to 450.","Chris","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Sara, the line is now open.","Stephanie Ng","Good morning, this is actually Stephanie Ng, representing Sara. I had a follow-up on to-go but more on the promotions side. Part of that growth seems driven by ongoing promotions, so your Buy One Take One Home and the discounts, which makes sense if you\u2019re attempting to drive traffic to a new channel. But at what point do you pull back on the promos or discounts, and the specifically for to-go, how do you think about incrementality versus just incentivizing customers to shift from off-premise to on-premise? ","Gene Lee","Yes, first clarification - Buy One Take One does not get into the to-go numbers at all. That\u2019s an in-restaurant promotion, although it\u2019s the ultimate convenience because the consumer gets to take a to-go meal home with that, but that\u2019s all logged in restaurant. Part of what we\u2019re doing from an incentive standpoint on the to-go is we think it\u2019s an area we need to remind the consumer we do that in a cost effective way, and it\u2019s incredibly valuable for us to be able to engage a new consumer because through to-go, we pick up a tremendous amount of personal information that helps us market more effectively to that person, so we\u2019ll continue to use promotional activity, and we feel the margin structure is fairly strong because especially we get them to engage online. We think that this is somewhat incremental. These are different visits. These takeout visits are different. I don\u2019t think people sit home and decide whether they\u2019re going to eat in restaurant or they\u2019re going to eat takeout - they\u2019ve decided they want to have a takeout experience and therefore they\u2019re using Olive Garden for that, so again we go back to what we\u2019re trying to do in Olive Garden. We\u2019re trying to feed our most loyal guests where and when they want Olive Garden food.","Stephanie Ng","Okay, thank you. Then a quick question on Longhorn. So we tracked Longhorn promotions over the quarter and we observed the introduction of value offerings - think of the $10 burger and drink combo. What was the reasoning behind introducing this product and this price point, and then how does it fit into Longhorn\u2019s broader strategy?","Gene Lee","Well, I think when we looked at it, it was just a cross promotion with Coca Cola. Every year, we have so marketing dollars to use with Coca Cola, and it was a way for us to do a cross promotion with them that I thought was a value add without having to use dollar discounts. Longhorn\u2019s overall TDIs for the quarter were down, their incentives were down, so I feel good about--you know. ","I do think just in fairness to the way you guys are counting how we do the TDIs, you\u2019ve got to be careful because a lot of those TDIs are exploding offers that are very short in nature and we\u2019re trying to stimulate traffic. I think on Longhorn, the burger and a Coke one, I thought that was a great offer. We have to figure a way to market lunch as effectively as we can because we know the big negative trade down if we trade a dinner into lunch from the margin standpoint really hurts us, so we\u2019ve got to come up with creative ways to keep lunch fresh. At Longhorn, I thought that was actually the best lunch promotion they ran all quarter.","Stephanie Ng","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Matt, your line is now open.","Matt Kirschner","It\u2019s actually Matt Kirschner on for Matt DiFrisco. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the two Cheddar\u2019s acquisitions, and what is your long-term philosophy on franchisees going forward?","Gene Lee","Both the Cheddar\u2019s acquisitions, the one done before we purchased Cheddar\u2019s corporate and the one that we did at the end of the quarter, were rights of first refusal. We\u2019re not actively in the marketplace trying to repurchase our franchisees. We want to be a great franchisor. We want to make our franchisees as successful as they possibly can; however, when the opportunity arose to buy especially the CMP franchise, we wanted that territory back, we wanted to control that territory - it\u2019s one that we knew, and we were able to buy that on very, very good terms.","Matt Kirschner","What do you kind of expect as far as the impact of buying back some of these larger franchisees going forward?","Gene Lee","Well first of all, the impact of buying CMP is pretty immaterial for this fiscal year, and after that there\u2019s, I think, only 14 restaurants that are franchised, so there aren\u2019t many big franchisees left, and all of those impacts would be contemplated in the guidance that we gave. ","Matt Kirschner","Understood, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is now open.","Jason West","Yes, thanks. Just a quick one and a follow up. Can you guys give the mix on to-go sales in the quarter? And then big picture, as we\u2019ve seen the industry numbers be so weak here this last few months, even outside of the hurricanes, just love to get your thoughts on why you think the industry traffic is so weak as we\u2019re lapping some pretty weak numbers from last year, and the decision to pull back on that value promotion at lunch in this environment. Thanks.","Gene Lee","Yes Jason, I think I missed your first question - oh, the to-go mix? ","Jason West","To-go - yes.","Gene Lee","We\u2019re not breaking that out at this point in time. We\u2019re giving you the overall percentage growth, but we\u2019re not getting into what\u2019s coming from catering and what\u2019s coming from third party, so on and so forth. ","As far as the overall environment, I continue to look at the stronger players that I think are well positioned, who have good value equations. They continue to take market share. I think I said in the last call that if you took out the bottom 25% of the indexes, the players that are pretty weak, you have flat to slightly--a little bit of growth in those benchmarks, but at the end of the day it keeps coming back to there\u2019s a lot of competition for the discretionary dollar, and we\u2019ve got to fight not just amongst ourselves to provide value to the guests but we\u2019ve got to provide value against other options for them to spend their discretionary income. I think it\u2019s a total focus on value, and I think that gets back into our strategy, which is to use our scale and our platform to our advantage, under-price inflation and under-price our competitors, and operate better to create a better value equation for our guests, and I think that\u2019s what we continue to do. I expect the environment to pretty much stay the same in the foreseeable future.","Jason West","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is coming from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan. John, your line is now open.","John Ivankoe","Hi, great. The question is on delivery, not the $100-plus catering delivery but other options that you have to maybe do smaller meals or individual. What are you currently seeing in your current tests? Is this something that you want to do nationally? Do you feel that you have an economic model design that can be profit additive to you as the incremental units offset presumably what may be a lower margin on sales? Just whatever commentary that we can have.","Gene Lee","John, we\u2019re in test with multiple vendors to see how this is going to play out. It\u2019s in the early stages. We\u2019re trying to learn, we\u2019re trying to understand what the check average is. We\u2019re trying to understand how good these third parties can execute, because that\u2019s a big part. The consumer\u2019s perception is always going to be the supplier, not the person that\u2019s in the middle delivering the product that\u2019s going to get blamed for good product, cold product, product that\u2019s been shaken or whatever, so we\u2019re going slow with this. We\u2019re analyzing it. It\u2019s a unique opportunity. Let\u2019s see whether this is a phase or a fad, and we\u2019re positioned to continue to analyze it. I mean, one of the options is doing it ourselves. We\u2019re not sure we want to go there, but we\u2019ll continue to figure this out. There\u2019s too many players in this space right now for it to work. There\u2019s not enough profit for the third party people to survive, and so we\u2019ve just got to let this whole thing play out, and right now I think our focus is on a bigger pie, which is B2B and B2C at over $100.","John Ivankoe","And that to some extent was my question as well - is there any thought internally about maybe broadening some of the constraints that you\u2019re currently asking the consumer in terms of ordering delivery? I think it\u2019s $100-plus and 24 hours. I mean, is there a thought of just giving them more options to where it still can be profitable for you to deliver it yourself?","Gene Lee","Yes, we have a test going on right now with that, to see how that works and for us to really analyze to make sure that there\u2019s enough profit for the effort and understanding the risk. I mean, you have to remember for Olive Garden, the majority of our restaurants are in suburban neighborhoods where there\u2019s not a lot of desire for this. This is an urban concept - it\u2019s not New York or Boston or whatever. In Omaha, there\u2019s no desire for this on a large scale. I mean, you\u2019re not driving into suburbia. In some of these places, not even Uber\u2019s cars drive around, so let\u2019s--we want to go slow and we want to be thoughtful about this.","John Ivankoe","Understood, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Steve Anderson from Maxim Group. Steve, your line is now open.","Steve Anderson","Yes, thank you, and thank you for providing some of the commentary on your impacts from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma (indiscernible) regarding the victims. Wanted to go a little more deeply into Harvey, given that the extent of the closures related to flooding likely extended into the first week of your fiscal second quarter. Do you anticipate any impact on your second quarter EPS from that?","Gene Lee","Yes Stephen, you\u2019re right - pretty astute. We did have more closed days in the second quarter for Harvey than in the first quarter, but that we have contemplated in the double the impact of Harvey, so the Irma plus any impact of Harvey in the second quarter, including any pent-up demand that happens in Houston and other areas is all contemplated in our double the impact of Harvey in Q2.","Steve Anderson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Andrew, your line is now open.","Andrew Strelzik","Hey, good morning. So my question is actually on development. You mentioned Longhorn performance in new markets, very happy with that, and I know if you look at the long-term targets, obviously it does imply an acceleration from a development perspective, so I guess I\u2019m just wondering what are the vehicles that you really see in terms of the brands to getting to that? When do we really start to see it play out in the numbers here, getting towards those long-term targets?","Gene Lee","Yes, we\u2019ve been at the lower end of the long term target for growth, and I think as we build up the pipeline for new restaurants, hopefully we can slide that upward. We\u2019re very pleased with our new restaurant growth right now. We\u2019ve opened some very strong Yardhouses, Olive Garden and Longhorn.","Let me just clarify my comment on Longhorn and newer markets. When I\u2019m referring to these newer markets, really non-legacy markets, we\u2019ve been in these markets for three or four years. Historically, it\u2019s taken time for Longhorn to really develop a following and for people to really get the value equation, and we\u2019re really starting to see that as we continue to grow, so that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving the same restaurant sales growth. When you look at the Longhorn footprint, there\u2019s not much room - these are small, small buildings, so 6,000 square feet, some of them are closer to 5,000, and you get great average unit volumes out of Florida and Atlanta. You don\u2019t have a lot of growth, so if you\u2019re going to get same restaurant sales growth, they\u2019ve got to come from some of these newer markets that opened a little bit slower.","One other thing on the long term framework. When we talk about our 2% to 3% over a longer period of time, we are considering acquisitions in that, and so adding our new Cheddar\u2019s restaurants to that has a big push in this fiscal year, but think about what the impact is of that over a five-year horizon.","Andrew Strelzik","Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. Then if I could just add one on the margin side, labor dollars per store stepped up year-over-year more than they have in the last couple quarters. Is that entirely related to Cheddar\u2019s or is there anything else in there, and also could you quantify for Olive Garden margins what the CPG shift, what that impact is? Thank you very much.","Gene Lee","Sure. On the labor dollars per restaurant, yes, a big impact of that is Cheddar\u2019s. If you think about their AUVs or average AUVs for Darden, that $4.5 million with higher labor as a percent of sales, and we did have some labor inflation, so that did drive labor costs on a per-restaurant basis up a little bit, but it was probably 50\/50.","In regards to the impact to Olive Garden or the CPG shift, it was 20 basis points to Olive Garden, 20 basis point improvement in margin to Olive Garden. We\u2019re talking about less than a couple million dollars, maybe, in a quarter on CPG sales.","Andrew Strelzik","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Joshua Long from Piper Jaffray. Joshua, your line is now open.","Joshua Long","Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on your commentary on the newer markets for Longhorn. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re happy with that progress or if the comment was meant to say that there might be something you could do to help spur additional consumer awareness, or if really just, as you mentioned, Gene, kind of fleshing out how the newer markets are performing. Just curious if that\u2019s something that could be pressed a little further or if it\u2019s really going at the right pace right now.","Gene Lee","No, I think it\u2019s going at the right pace. I\u2019m thrilled with some of these markets. When you\u2019re busting in as a third or fourth steakhouse in a trade area, people have to have a reason to try you, and you have to work the Longhorn menu a little bit to really understand the value. We tried to move that along through different processes, different marketing campaigns, but history tells us it\u2019s just time. Over time, Longhorn has a pretty good growth spurt, and many of these markets--you know, we don\u2019t have a lot of penetration. There\u2019s no TV in those markets. It\u2019s just something that\u2019s been organic for the brand for the last 20 years, and I\u2019m thrilled with it because I know there\u2019s great value in Longhorn.","Joshua Long","Thank you for that, that makes sense. Then I wanted to see if you also might be able to update us on where we\u2019re at with the remodel-refresh effort and how that\u2019s progressing.","Gene Lee","Yes, we\u2019re making great progress. We\u2019ve got 116 done to date - 23 were completed in the first quarter. We expect to do almost another 100 in fiscal \u201918. I do think that number, we didn\u2019t look at that number after the two storms. You can only imagine that there is some labor shortage out there from that skill set, so we don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to be impacted, but we\u2019ve got plans to do a lot more in the back half of the year.","Joshua Long","Great, thanks for the time today.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Gregory, your line is now open.","Gregory Francfort","I had two questions. The first one is just on the labor cost. One of your major competitors is testing shifting their model to where they\u2019re adding runners in the restaurant to potentially reduce hours. Is there something that you can test along those lines? Is that something you\u2019ve explored, and maybe how are you thinking about the current labor model?","Gene Lee","For the past 20 years, we\u2019ve looked at different ways to run our dining rooms. Some of our businesses use runners; some of our businesses don\u2019t use runners. At the end of the day, trying to cut back labor that is dedicated to taking care of your guests is not a smart move, and we will continue to improve and try to enhance the service that we\u2019re providing our guests. So we believe in three-table stations, when we\u2019re really busy we have runners behind them, but we are focused on trying to improve the service, and we talk a lot about it at Darden, we want to put the full back into full service.","Gregory Francfort","That makes a ton of sense. The other question was on Cheddar\u2019s. How meaningful is the switch of the distribution business from an external party onto the Darden platform, and can you help us understand the timing of that and maybe what goes into those changes?","Gene Lee","Yes, it\u2019s a big part of the synergies that we\u2019ve given you. It\u2019s probably half of it just getting on our platform, so the timing, I think it starts next week or the week after. Hopefully it\u2019s going to be seamless. They have to order differently than what they have in the past, with a little bit more of an electronic ordering process. They probably might have to think out a day further ahead than they had in the past, so there is some operational complexity there, but this is a big part of putting anybody on our platform. We work extremely hard to ensure that our supply chain is efficient as it possibly can be, and this is a big part of us getting our synergies. ","Gregory Francfort","Got it. That\u2019s helpful, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jake Bartlett from SunTrust. Jake, your line is now open.","Jake Bartlett","Great, thanks for taking the questions. First, I had a question about the inflationary environment. You mentioned that you\u2019re in the high end of the labor inflation guidance in the first quarter, you expect that to continue throughout the year. I might have missed it, but if you could tell us what the commodity inflation was in the first quarter?","Gene Lee","Yes, we didn\u2019t specifically point out what the commodity inflation was in the first quarter. We did say that for the year, it\u2019s zero to 1%, and the commodity inflation in the first quarter was within that range, so it was inflationary where in the past we were deflationary.","Jake Bartlett","Okay, and then on wage inflation?","Gene Lee","Wage inflation, we said it was at the high end of our 3% to 4%, so assume around 4%.","Jake Bartlett","Okay. Is the environment such that you think that\u2019s going to continue? Are you still seeing the kind of wage inflation that we--","Gene Lee","You know, we\u2019ve been seeing this wage inflation roughly around the 3% to 4% range for a while, and we don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that says that is going to come down. That said, we have the industry leading turnover, so we\u2019re able to offset some of the wage inflation by spending our time training our folks to get better and to be more effective and more efficient than maybe training somebody to learn our systems, so we think that helps our productivity in the long run.","Jake Bartlett","Okay. I had a question about the promotional environment and how you play into it. It looks like for the past couple years, your market share gains have accelerated as the environment became much more promotional or more value oriented. I don\u2019t think this is your view, but if the environment got less value oriented, how do you think you\u2019d fare? Would that imply some market share narrowing of that gap, or do you think you can kind of maintain your outperformance even if the promotional environment was less value oriented?","Gene Lee","You know, I think we have levers to pull and are nimble enough to compete effectively in any type of environment. If the environment was a little bit better, maybe we\u2019d take a little more price. I think that we\u2019ll continue to compete effectively. The loyalty between both Longhorn and Olive Garden with our guests, and especially Olive Garden, what Olive Garden means to the American cultural fabric is just incredible. I mean, we just did the pasta fast promotion - the amount of participation in that, the amount of comments that were posted, the amount of press coverage, Olive Garden is an important brand in American society, and I think it\u2019s going to compete effectively now and for a long period of time.","Jake Bartlett","Great, thanks for that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Peter, your line is now open.","Peter Saleh","Great, thanks for taking the question. I believe last quarter you had mentioned the guest satisfaction scores at Olive Garden were at an all-time high. Can you give us an update on where the guest satisfaction scores are today and maybe where your value scores are in relation to last quarter?","Gene Lee","Yes, overall quarter to quarter we were flat; however, service did tick up. I think about the drivers of that, we\u2019ve got to continue to simplify the operation. These are very high volume, complex restaurants, and the more simplicity that the team can bring to it, and you think about just doing one less promotion inside that last quarter, that improved our--you know, that simplified things for the restaurant managers dramatically by not having to do one more rollout. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re really focused on, is the simplicity of it, and hopefully that will continue to lead to better execution.","Was there a second question there, Peter, I missed?","Peter Saleh","No, I was just curious as to the value scores this quarter versus last.","Gene Lee","Yes, value scores have ticked up just a little bit. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s significant, but they are already fairly high. When you do come off your TDIs a little bit, your value is going to take a little bit of a hit too, but I look at--you know, you can\u2019t look at one metric. You have to look at all the metrics together to inform you to make good decisions. If you\u2019re just trying to get one metric, I hate to use a sports analogy, but it doesn\u2019t matter how many first downs you get in a football game. You\u2019ve got to put the most points up on the board, so we\u2019ve got a lot of data coming in. We think we\u2019ve got a competitive advantage here. We look at all that data and that helps inform us to make decisions that we think are good for the long term for that specific business, not what\u2019s good for the first quarter or for the quarter that we\u2019re in, what\u2019s good for the long term. ","Peter Saleh","Got it, great. Thank you very much, I appreciate that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Jeffrey, your line is now open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great, thank you very much. Two questions - one, just when you think about the cost savings or productivity enhancements, I\u2019m just wondering what are the dollars assumed within the fiscal \u201918 guidance? It sounds like you\u2019re reiterating the 10 to 40 basis points of EBIT margin expansion, but I\u2019m just wondering what the dollar expectation is and where we are on that ultimate opportunity from a cost savings perspective.","Rick Cardenas","Yes Jeff, it\u2019s Rick. We stopped talking about what the dollar impact was probably about six months ago as we wanted to make sure that we talked long term about our margin enhancements of 10 to 40 basis points coming from cost saves. The reason we\u2019re not talking about all the dollars is because we may reinvest some of that, right, so as we think about what our cost saves are, and whenever we tell you a number, we want to tell you what the net P&L impact of that was, and so the zero to 1% inflation may actually end up being less than that if we have cost saves, and we\u2019ll talk about that at the end of the year what our total was when we give the cost saves at the end of the year.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got it. Just on the cash usage, it looks like you had $100 million in repo on the first quarter. I think when you gave initial guidance for fiscal \u201918, you thought it would be $100 million to $200 million in repo for the year, but it would be a more evenly paced repurchase throughout \u201918. So I\u2019m just wondering if the guidance is for it to be evenly split, it would seem like you\u2019re going to run well above the 100 to 200, should we assume that that\u2019s possible or whether we should assume a big pull back in repo the rest of the year.","Rick Cardenas","Yes, I\u2019ll start by saying that, remember, the long-term framework was $100 million to $200 million a year, and there will be years we\u2019ll be above and years we\u2019ll be below. We did anticipate somewhere in that range, but we also said that when the market gives us opportunity, we\u2019ll be aggressive, and we think the market gave us some opportunity in the first quarter and so we were aggressive in the first quarter and bought $100 million. Most of that was at the end of the first quarter, though, so it shouldn\u2019t really have had an impact on Q1. Most of that purchase was at the end of Q1.","That said, there will be a possibility that we\u2019ll be above the $200 million this year, and as we know more of that, we\u2019ll let you know.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","We show no further questions in queue at this time. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to you, Kevin.","Kevin Kalicak","Thank you, Shawn. That concludes our call. I would like to remind you all that we plan to release second quarter results on Tuesday, December 19 before the market opens, with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. ","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may disconnect at this moment.

With me today is Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Brad Richmond, Darden's CFO, and Bill White, Darden's Treasurer. We welcome those of you joining us by telephone or the Internet. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

A reconciliation of these measurements is in our earnings release. In addition, we are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call. This presentation will be posted under the Investors tab on our Web site at the conclusion of the call. We plan to release fiscal 2016 first quarter earnings on Tuesday, September 22, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. Following prepared remarks from Gene and Brad, we will take your questions.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thanks, Rick. Good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter across all of our brands. Total sales grew 13.8% for the quarter, which was driven by combined same-restaurant sales growth of 3.8%, with positive same-restaurant sales at each of our brands, the addition of 33 net new restaurants, and the 53rd week of operations, which contributed 7.5% of sales growth to the quarter.","Earnings per share on an adjusted basis increased 100% to $1.08, and fourth quarter adjusted EBIT margins increased significantly. Our fourth quarter capped a strong finish to 2015. For the year, annual sales from continuing operations increased by 7.6% to 6.8 billion, and all of our brands had positive same-restaurant sales for the year.","Adjusted EBIT margins increased by 150 basis points through continued cost management, same-restaurant sales growth leveraging, and the unwinding of deep discounting at Olive Garden. As a result, our annual earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $2.63 a share, which was an increase of 54% versus last year.","At Olive Garden, business momentum continued with 10 consecutive months of same-restaurant sales growth. The brand had sequential quarterly same-restaurant sales improvement throughout the year, and had its first annual same-restaurant sales increase since fiscal 2011.","Our Olive Garden strategy has been to focus on our core guests and the frequency of their visits by concentrating on the following areas: First, ongoing service and culinary simplifications that allow our restaurant teams to deliver great food and service. Second, continued menu evolution that focuses on our core brand equities; the improving appeal of Cucina Mia provides a great everyday value option for our guests, thereby allowing us to be more balanced with our promotional offerings.","Next, with a refined understanding of our core guest demographics, we have increased our digital marketing efforts. This enables us to reach guests with more relevant messaging through targeted online advertising, CRM, and social media engagement. And our takeout program meets our guests' growing needs for convenience, and continues to drive significant growth. We increased takeout sales by over 23% versus last year in the fourth quarter to approximately 10% of sales.","Finally, better operations, leadership alignment on key priorities as a result of reduced management layers in the field has led to elevated execution. This was an important year for Olive Garden, and we're pleased with the progress we've made. The improvement in our results this year tells us we're working on the right things, and it underscores Olive Garden's tremendous brand equity and potential. With that said, our work at Olive Garden is still in its early stages, and we still see plenty of opportunity ahead.","LongHorn had a solid year of performance with annual same-restaurant sales of 4.4% and positive guest counts of 0.08, both of which significantly outpaced the industry. Segment profits at LongHorn increased by 17% despite near double-digit beef inflation for the year.","This performance is the result of several factors, including growing the business by focusing on guest loyalty, leveraging the core menu, and the Peak Season and Chef's Showcase platforms to offer regional flavors, and evolving our marketing strategy with more effective local execution, broader use of CRM and digital advertising, and a stronger promotional pipeline that leveraged our steak expertise. As we enter fiscal 2016, LongHorn is well positioned to improve on its same-restaurant sales growth and continue to improve margins.","Now, let's spend a few minutes discussing the real estate announcement we made this morning. The Board and I are excited about our announcement to separate a significant portion of our real estate and create a separate real estate business, which can grow in its own right. This decision was the result of a comprehensive analysis that we performed along with the support of our advisors. The plan is intended to optimize the value of our real estate by separating approximately 500 of our real estate properties utilizing three different steps; first, the sale leaseback of approximately 75 restaurant properties, second, the sale leaseback of our restaurant support center in Orlando, and third, a REIT separation.","After receipt of the proceeds, we intend to pay down $1 billion of debt. We expect this will maintain our investment grade credit profile. We believe this plan results in a favorable outcome for all of Darden stakeholders by strengthening our balance sheet, while positioning two companies to succeed in the future. The strategic rationale for our real estate separation creates benefits for both Darden and the future REIT.","The benefits to Darden include an improved capital structure with no funded debt maturities for 20 years, improved capital allocation that strengthens our return on invested capital, and a strong conservative financial position that offers solid coverage for market rents. The benefits to the REIT are a lower cost of capital in Darden, and the ability to focus on growing a real estate business through broader opportunities beyond Darden. And finally, we expect the market to properly reflect the fair market value of real estate through the higher valuations from real estate companies compared to restaurant-operating companies.","Now, looking at the three elements of our intended plan; we began conducting individual restaurant sale leasebacks in March of 2015 with 16 properties, and have expanded this to a total of approximately 75 properties, consisting mostly of Olive Gardens. We continue to be extremely pleased with the demand for our properties. We expect an average cash capitalization rate of approximately 5.5% for all 75 properties, and that EBITDAR will provide greater than three times the rent coverage.","We anticipate a net book gain of approximately $50 million on the total 75 properties, with a $65 million gain being recognized over the next 15 years, and a loss of approximately $50 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.","Next, we're pursuing the sale leaseback of the restaurant support center in Orlando. And finally, the proposed REIT transaction would consist of approximately 430 high quality own property selected for their ability to comfortably cover market rents. The tenant base for the REIT will standout versus other REIT peers, and that is a 100% investment grade with an initial concentration of Olive Garden properties, and the REIT will be in a position to diversify to efficient 1031 asset exchanges.","We have proven that our Olive Garden properties are in high demand, and the REIT management can utilize some of these highly desired Olive Garden properties to exchange for other diversifying assets. Additionally, we are capitalizing the REIT to provide capacity to support growth through acquisitions on day one. We anticipate this REIT will be attractively positioned immediately, and in the near future be able to further shape its metrics to be best-in-class.","As previously noted, after receipt of the proceeds, we intend to retire $1 billion of debt. This debt retirement will be sourced by the sale leaseback proceeds, a REIT distribution back to Darden at the separation funded by debt raised at the REIT, and cash on our balance sheet. Retiring debt allows us to strengthen our balance sheet, while almost entirely working through the existing sale leaseback basket. We will be seeking bondholder consent to expand our current sale leaseback covenant limitation in the most straightforward manner. We fully expect bondholders to appreciate that we're choosing to seek their consent, but we may also consider other structuring alternatives.","We expect the execution of our real estate strategy to be viewed as credit neutral to positive. We anticipate Darden's annualized cash rent to increase by approximately $120 million per year, and GAAP rent expense net of gain amortization of approximately 135 million, due to rent averaging accounting requirements. Depreciation will be reduced by approximately 40 million, and we will save approximately $45 million in interest due to debt retirement. This implies a run rate reduction in pretax earnings of approximately $50 million. We anticipate the combined dividends of both companies to be equal to Darden's current dividend.","Looking at our timeline, we filed our private letter ruling request with the IRS on April 17. As many of you may know, last month the IRS announced a pause in issuing private letter rulings on the active trade or business in transactions like we're discussing today. However, our private letter ruling request is grandfathered until further notice from the IRS, since it was filed in April. We have been watching developments closely, and recognize that the IRS is reviewing its ruling practice in this area. Nonetheless, we have a significant corporate business reason for the selection of our active trade or business, which we believe meets all applicable laws.","Other highlights in our timeline include finalizing the individual restaurant sale leaseback transactions, and the sale leaseback of the restaurant support center. Between now and the end of December 2015, we expect to identify and appoint the REIT management team in Board, file the Form 10 with the SEC, and complete the REIT financing and Darden debt retirement. Once again, we're excited about this next step in the evolution of Darden. Our fundamental restaurant operations and the guest experience will remain the same, but we will be separating a new real estate company, which will be able be independently grow with properties outside of Darden.","And now Brad will share our financial update and outlook for fiscal 2016.","Brad Richmond","Well, thank you, Gene, and good morning everybody. Fourth quarter adjusted EBIT margins expanded versus the prior year at an ever great amount than in the third quarter. This acceleration was the result of reduced discounting at Olive Garden, a more normalized commodity cost environment, greater costs savings, leveraging our positive same-restaurant sales, and the contribution of the 53rd week.","Additionally, 50 basis points of the restaurant expense improvement this quarter versus last year related to improved workers' compensation and public safety performance achieved during the year. This quarter, we began reporting marketing and G&A expenses individually. Marketing as a percent of sales was below last year due to lower but more normalized marketing support levels. G&A as a percentage of sales increased due to three drivers; higher incentive costs related to the strong business performance, higher equity-based incentive costs that are hedged and fully offset in our tax expense, and investor costs related to the cost reduction efforts that are more than offset by the identified cost savings captured in our performance.","Sales for the 53rd week were higher than we previously anticipated. Along with our improved margins and low tax rate, the 53rd week resulted in $0.07 of additional EPS in the quarter. I want to direct your attention to segment level reporting we introduced this quarter, which provides additional transparency into our results. The four segments are Olive Garden, LongHorn, Fine Dining, which includes The Capital Grille and Eddie V's, and our other businesses which includes Yard House, Season 52, Bahama Breeze, Consumer Packaged Goods, and franchise revenues. The segment profit reflects sales less costs related to food and beverage, restaurant labor, restaurant expenses, and marketing expenses. It's worth noting this quarter's profit improved significantly for each operating segment.","Now, the outlook we are sharing for fiscal 2016 today is based on our restaurant operating results, and does not include the impact of the real estate transactions that Gene outlined, and any related cash and capital structure activities we undertake. We will provide additional information on those financial impacts once the timing and specific details of the proposed transactions are final.","For 2016, we anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.05 to $3.20, that's growth of 20% to 25% on a 52-week basis. Improving operations performance is expected to contribute $0.45 to $0.60 of EPS growth in fiscal 2016. In addition, we have interest rate savings of $0.04 in the first quarter from last year's debt retirement of $1 billion.","So, of the total, $0.49 to $0.64 of annual year-over-year EPS growth in fiscal 2016, we anticipate two-thirds of the growth in the first half of year, and the remainder in the second half. The front [ph] weighted growth is related to the timing of the reduced interest expense, costs savings, lapping on fiscal 2015 performance, and the benefit of the accelerated share repurchase in fiscal 2015.","Our other expectations for 2016 include 18 to 22 new restaurant openings, with LongHorn and Yard House accounting for the majority of the openings. We expect same-restaurant sales increase for the company between 2% and 2.5%, Olive Garden growth between 1.5% and 2.5%, an increase between 2.5% and 3.5% for LongHorn, and combined growth of approximately 3% for the specialty restaurant brands.","Same-restaurant sales will be reported on a 52-week basis, and will include several significant holiday shifts, in particular a Thanksgiving shift that will be moving into Q2 this fiscal year, compared to Q3 last fiscal year. Capital spending between 230 and 255 million with approximately 40% of that going to maintenance CapEx, approximately 30% for new restaurant spending, and the remainder going to refresh restaurants, technology, and other initiatives.","We expect an annual effective tax rate between 21% and 24%. We anticipate fiscal 2016 to be a more normalized inflation environment, resulting in overall inflation of 1.5% to 2%, with commodity inflation of 0.50% to 1%, and we expect the price at the low end of the overall inflation range.","Total annualized cost savings identified since October of fiscal 2015 have increased to $100 million to $110 million by fiscal 2017. That's $10 million higher than we announced in the third quarter. We realized 35 million of that savings in fiscal 2015. We expect 50 to 55 million in 2016, and the remainder in 2017. All of these savings expectations are net of any necessary reinvestments. We continue to evaluate all areas of our business to identify additional cost savings without impacting the guest experience.","And now, I'll turn it back over to Gene for some closing remarks.","Gene Lee","Thanks, Brad. Before we move to Q&A, I want to share a couple of final thoughts. Fiscal 2015 was a year of meaningful transition at Darden with the election of a new Board of Directors, as well as my appointment to CEO. We have made substantial progress towards our goal of returning Darden to a level of profitable sales growth and value creation our stakeholders expect. An integral factor in this progress is the strong working relationship between the Board and the Management team. This allows for a very open and constructive dialog, and has resulted in alignment around the key priorities that are driving our improved results.","Our back-to-basics focus, which is rooted in strong operating fundamentals around food service and atmosphere is a key reason for our proved guest experience and business performance. Of course, this is brought to life everyday by our 150,000 team members. As I visit restaurants across the country with our leadership teams, I clearly see their enthusiasm for creating the best experiences possible for our guests. On behalf of the Board and the leadership team I want to sincerely thank each and every team member for their hard work and dedication.","Lastly, I would like to thank Brad Richmond for his contributions during his 32 years of service, from financial analyst to Chief Financial Officer, he has impacted all of our brands, and more importantly, he has had a positive impact on every one he's had the opportunity to associate with. All of us at Darden wish him the very best as he enters the next chapter of his journey at the end of July.","Now, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","All right. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] All right. Our first question comes from Mr. Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Brett Levy","Good morning. Thank you. First of all, just a couple of little technical questions; do you have any sense as to what the square footage is for both the owned and the leased?","Gene Lee","We'll need you to repeat that. We couldn't hear you, Brett.","Brett Levy","Oh, I'm sorry. I asked if you had any square footage owned and leased right now.","Gene Lee","Do you want square footage, or do you want just number of restaurants?","Brett Levy","No, just the square footage, I think we have the number of units.","Gene Lee","No, we don't have the square footage. We can get back to you on that.","Brett Levy","Do you have any sense as to what we can expect in terms of market rents and rent escalations on the leases?","Bill White","Yes, Brett, this is Bill White. We are expecting rent escalations in the 1% to 2% range, and market rents will be at the -- we would say certainly in the market range, but at the more affordable level, but there will be a range there as well depending on the individual markets.","Brett Levy","Right. Do you have an actual number that we can target for the rent, either per box or per foot?","Bill White","On a square food basis, I would say in the $25 to $30 range.","Brett Levy","And can you give a little bit more clarity on breaking down where the drivers were in terms of Olive Garden profits and what the actual profit growth was?","Brad Richmond","Yes, Brett, this is Brad. And we've aided that question some with providing the segment information that we gave there. So you can see in the broad picture, but as we talked about for Olive Garden, the less discounting was obviously significant portion to them improving their profitability, along with their same-restaurant sales came some fairly meaningful leveraging of their restaurant expenses. Their improvement in workers' comp public liability was strong as well, and particularly food cost getting more back to normalized level, in the first half of the year we talked about dairy being up nearly 20% to the prior year. And so that has much more normalized for them as well.","Brett Levy","And where are you on your contract right now for next year?","Brad Richmond","One second here. So really for us we look out six months and we've got over 60% of our usage contracted, the back half of the year -- which the 60% is pretty typical where we are at this time of year, and we have about 20% contracted for the back half of our fiscal year. Angelina, can we get the next question please?","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from Mr. David Tarantino. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","David Tarantino","Gene, I had a question about the Olive Garden same-store sales dynamics, and I wanted to first ask if the 2016 outlook assumes that you'll return to positive same-store traffic for that brand at some point in the year and when you might expect that to occur, if that is the case?","Gene Lee","David, right now we're expecting traffic to be flattish for next year, which we think is going to end up beating the market by a point to point and a half. I've always said that the first barrier for us was to breakthrough and for Olive Garden to start to beat the market. We had a good quarter. We beat the market by a point and a little bit more if you add in the bulk takeout. So we're hoping that we can get the brand back to level guest counts, maybe slightly positive. And we would expect a little bit better traction in the back half of the year than the front half of the year as we still face some heavy discounting in the front half of '16.","David Tarantino","Great, that's helpful. And then perhaps could you provide an update on the remodel strategy for Olive Garden? I think at one point you had considered that a critical element of the brand renaissance. And I don't know where you stand in terms of your remodel program when you're looking at 2016 and 2017?","Gene Lee","Okay, Dave, we got a lot going on with remodels. I'll start off by saying the initial 13 that we did which were pretty extensive remodels are trending in the mid-seven range above the system average. So in a six-way analysis they are performing, it's a little over 7% in same-restaurant sales growth above the system. We've done another 20 or so remodels at different investment levels that were just starting to get a read-on. We're also up in the northeast working on 20 different bar remodels trying to figure out what we can do with the extra capacity that we have up there.","So I would say that there is -- we have a lot of test going on, we're really encouraged with the feedback and we're trying to continue to hone in on what's the right investment level, is there a couple different packages out there that we can deploy for that. So we don't happen to do this same package in every restaurant. I would also that Dave and the team are starting the initial work on Olive Garden of the future, and we've identified the site and we're really excited about building what I would call a \"Contemporary Olive Garden,\" an Olive Garden that will be really competitive in today's environment. And I'm hoping that will be a significant inspiration into the future as we continue to refresh our older Olive Gardens. So a lot of activity, and I'm really excited about the initial results that we're getting from the original 13 we did.","David Tarantino","Right. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","All right. Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Mr. Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Jeff Farmer","Great. The strength of Olive Garden's to-go business continues to surprise, in my opinion. So I guess, from the outside looking in, it seems like the opportunity was always there. So I'm just curious what the operational or strategic shift was, as you guys pursued to get that to-go business really moving in 2015? And as you look forward to 2016, is there greater opportunity with to-go?","Gene Lee","Yes, good question. I think what the Olive Garden team did first and foremost was they really rebuilt their systems and ensured they had the right system, the right packaging, and the right processes in place that enable this. This was really -- the insight came from our consumer insights team that said to the team, \"Listen, to-go is only going to get more and more important to our consumer. You have products that travel extremely well. You need to build out this capability.\"","So the teams that's been working on this for 18 months, they started off with the initial focus was a 100% accurate and a 100% on time. When you do consumer research around takeout, that's what the consumer really wants. Enabling it through web ordering has been a big help. We've also promoted, the team is getting ready to implement delivery. We think large party delivery is a big growth outlet. Over time, I expect and the team expects that 20% of Olive Garden's total sales is going to migrate to takeout, and we think that we're really well suited to take advantage of that opportunity.","Jeff Farmer","Just one quick follow-up; do you intend to pursue that delivery with a third party or tackle that yourself?","Gene Lee","We're looking at both options right now. We do think that the third party dynamic is going to change dramatically over the next couple of years, and we're on top of what's happening in that space.","Jeff Farmer","Okay, thank you.","Operator","All right. Thank you so much [indiscernible] Mr. Farmer. Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. Question with respect to the REIT structure, and I think you say the $1 billion to pay down debt. I wonder what you could -- how do you derive that or what is your total valuation that you're implying for the range for that 430 storefront or so?","Bill White","Yes, Jeff, this is Bill White. The best way to think about the total value is take a look at the aggregate rents that we've shared with the group. So we're looking at essentially about a 135 million of GAAP rents or a 120 million of cash rent. That will be divided up amongst all those restaurants, both the individual sale leasebacks that Gene alluded to, as well as the 430 within the REIT. And I think the best way to think about the value there is really think about we are a dollar brand trade within the real estate space or the REIT space versus an operating company to get a sense of what that value differential could be.","Matthew DiFrisco","Right. Okay. So then the $120 million is associated with the 500 stores, not just 430 that are going to spun out to the REIT?","Bill White","That's correct.","Matthew DiFrisco","Okay. And then also\u2026","Operator","Time up.","Matthew DiFrisco","Do I have time for another one?","Gene Lee","Go ahead, Matt.","Matthew DiFrisco","Okay. Thank you. With respect to the breaking out of the Specialties brand now, the greater granularity separating them out to Fine Dining and then other, I guess initially some of the Board strategies have been expressed before to be one of the next steps after a REIT is to spin off, or consider greater monetization of the Specialties division. Is this something now structurally that you're looking at the businesses differently than has been historic, where you bucketed them as a Specialties division and you're separating functions, as well now, in that the brands together, Capital Grille and Eddie V's, would be the better positioned standalone brands, where the classification of other means that they're more akin to needing the support of Olive Garden and LongHorn, the smaller brands?","Brad Richmond","No, I would say this is really about meeting investor needs for insight to how Darden's performing and understanding our financial performance. As we talked about, first in our priority right now is really the real estate strategy and executing on that. And I think down the road we will look at the opportunity for segmentations of the brand and separations of the brands, but that's far down our list right now, but something that we can look at, but don't read into this particular segmentation as anything beyond just providing more clarity, more transparency into our financial performance.","Matthew DiFrisco","Excellent, thank you.","Operator","Thank you so much Mr. DiFrisco. Our next question comes from Mr. John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","John Glass","Thanks. Good morning. Two questions; first, just being on the progression of the traffic at Olive Garden. So it declined sequentially through the quarter. The industry was down, but didn't really decline sequentially. Is that just a function of getting away from discounting -- how do you interpret that data, I guess, in looking at your overall comp was good, but the traffic was a weaker component than I would have thought?","Gene Lee","Yes, John, we had -- let's start with March, we actually had a strong promotion over a weak promotion that drove traffic. That was our BOTO. The Easter holiday had some effect in March\/April. When I look at those two months, I combine them, and then we are going over some heavy 999 discounting in May, and we backed off that this year. So when I looked at traffic for the quarter, I was overall pleased, I kind of wrapped up the quarter into -- I looked at -- last 15 out of 16 weeks Olive Garden has significantly beat Knapp-Track.","We had one week in there, which was Easter week, the prior year that was for some reason we had a really bad week. That may have had more to do with promotional way to some other timing, but over the last 15, start of 16 weeks Olive Garden has significantly outperformed Knapp-Track. So I am pleased, I am not caught up any sequential trends where we continue to move our marketing spend to try to understand what's working and what's not. And when you make some commitments, sometimes it takes three to four weeks to adjust after you try something that might not be working as well as you like.","Also remember we have 50 basis points of traffic that's not accounted for in our large party takeout. So we are not giving ourselves any guest counts for pans of lasagne [ph] or big pans of Fettuccine Alfredo. And that equates to approximately 50 basis points in additional traffic.","John Glass","Thank you for the color. If I could just follow up with a question on the REIT, in your assumption of valuations, the sale leaseback market is hot, and therefore, you get some pretty attractive cap rates. Are you assuming that the REIT has not penetrated that favorable cap rate, in other words, a lower valuation or a higher cap rate? And have you thrown out or are you willing to throw out any ranges you're initially assuming in that valuation that you just talked about?","Bill White","Yes, John, this is Bill White. Yes, we wouldn't want to speculate on that. We could just tell you that historically there is a pretty significant value differential between restaurant operating companies and REITs, but we wouldn't want to really speculate on the specifics about valuation on the REIT.","John Glass","Would you at least be willing to say that you think that a single tenant REIT trades at a much lower valuation than a diversified REIT, and that's your working assumption going in and you diversify it over time to get improved valuation?","Bill White","There is a lot of other factors that go into that valuation, aside from diversification. Some of the factors that -- Gene mentioned the fact that this will be a 100% investment grade tenant base, and there is really no triple -- no public triple net REITs that are even close to that level, so certainly other factors would go into that.","John Glass","Okay, thank you.","Operator","All right. Thank you so much Mr. Glass. Our next question comes from Mr. Joseph Buckley from the Bank of America. Sir your line is open you may proceed.","Joseph Buckley","Thank you. First operating question or two, and then a couple of REIT questions, as well, in the overall inflation expectations for FY16, you shared the food inflation expectation. What are you thinking on labor inflation?","Brad Richmond","Hi, Joe, this is Brad, and we put that in the all others, in that 2% to 3%. I would say the wage rate is probably in the upper-half of that range, but there's many other items that when you look at our P&L that would be bringing that overall inflation rate to the middle of that range at this point.","Joseph Buckley","Okay. And then on the traffic, the traffic piece at Olive Garden, does that include the benefit of the to-go transactions? I think you said to-go sales were up 23%. So is that buried within that traffic number, so the on-site traffic numbers would be worse than what we're looking at?","Brad Richmond","Some of the to-go traffic, if we sell entrees to go that is part of the traffic. If we sell large party items, such as pans of lasagna, anything that's bulk, and which we're doing a lot of. We're not taking any guest counts for that, Joe. And that has a 50 basis point impact on guest counts.","Joseph Buckley","Okay. And then\u2026","Operator","All right, thank you so much. Our next question comes from Mr. David Palmer of the RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","David Palmer","Thanks. Just a quick question, Gene, just looking back and looking forward with regard to your costs, I know that there was a lot of costs that you got out of overhead by undoing a matrix type structure. But as you look at the P&L from a restaurant perspective, how are you getting at the costs better than you did before? Is there any real changes that are happening, even with regard to real estate? For instance, when you break out rent costs, you shine a brighter light on the underlying real restaurant earnings. Is that part of what you're getting out of the restaurant margins here is you're more accurately getting at the real restaurant earnings in your underlying assets? Thanks.","Gene Lee","Yes, David. A couple of components to that; first, I think our team is doing a much better job from a labor cost stand point. We're really focusing on being able to effectively plan our volume, and then from there, effectively plan the labor cost, and we've been able to take out a lot of cost that's built into the system. Compound that with the work the team is doing to simplify operations, for example, Olive Garden in the quarter, was able to take a 140 basis points of labor out, and improve their overall service metrics, which to me is exciting. I would also say is that, we've got teams doing zero-based budgeting with restaurants.","And we're going up here in each of the brands, and were pulling -- across the country we're pulling every single invoice inside a restaurant, and we're finding things that have creeped in over the years from a basic restaurant operations perspective that we're able to take out. And so, I think our operating teams are doing a great job of going in and saying, for example, how many times do we really need to clean the carpets in a restaurant? There is a protocol, that you clean carpets once a month. If you do it more than that you end up actually destroying the carpet, and see really not a whole lot of benefit there. So we found a lot of restaurants that were cleaning carpets twice-a-month. So we've been able to find -- that's just one example of the costs the operating teams have been able to find over time. And so, this is really a bottoms-up, back-to-basics restaurant approach to remove costs from the P&L.","David Palmer","Just follow-up on the REIT thing, if you were -- would you contribute some of your debt over to the REIT, would that be how it would work that you would lever up the REIT and then borrow new money on the remain co? How would that work in terms of setting up a capital structure in the future? Thanks.","Bill White","Yes, David, this is Bill. We're still working through some of those details. Unlikely that we would do a debt for debt exchange of some kind, most likely some type of debt raise at the REIT, but we're still working through all those specifics, and we'll have more to come in our public filing.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you so much Mr. Palmer. Our next question comes from Mr. Will Slabaugh from the Stephens, Inc. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Will Slabaugh","Thanks, guys. Two quick questions, if I could. First, on Olive Garden, can you give us any further detail around the deep discounting you talked about at Olive Garden that you noted you're in the process of removing. What form did most of that discounting take, and then what percentage of what you would call discounting remains at the brand right now?","Gene Lee","Yes, the majority of the deep discounting we're referring to is the 999 promotional platform that we were running last year. We were running a lot of 999, 1099, 11 of the 13 weeks in Q4 fiscal '15, what we call, deep-discounted. We refer to anything below 1199 as really deep-discounting. We're still going to have to have some value platforms across Olive Garden to drive the business, never Ending Pasta Bowl is not going away, it's in the base; it's something that we're going to need to do. But strategically, last February, of fiscal '15, we went back in, and we added Cucina Mia to the menu so that we could have a 999 price point to offer everyday value to our guests. This menu item is gaining momentum. It's gaining momentum across a few constituents that use the Olive Garden restaurant.","We're finding that millennials love the 999 Cucina Mia because they get to customize their meal. We also find the value seekers like that entry price point. What's interesting is that 50% of the people who enter Cucina Mia at 999 do buy an add-on. And so the price does come up. Our strategy all along was to introduce and get everyday value back on the menu, become less reliant on, what we would refer to as, a lot of deep-discounting to drive the traffic. We want to continue to migrate over to more brand building, more advertising around the food that people really love. We love to be doing stuff around our [indiscernible] which has a lot of following. So we got to continue to evolve that piece of it.","Will Slabaugh","Got it. And one quick one on the REIT, if I could; it seems like a couple of the primary benefits would be around one, the potential valuation gap which you mentioned, and then also the ability to add more leverage to a REIT and return that excess cash to shareholders through a dividend. Can you shed any more color on longer term capital plans for the REIT?","Gene Lee","Yes, we're really not in a position, Mr. Will. We're not in a position to go into a lot of those details. We've still got to work through some of those, and again I think we'll have more to say when we get to the point where we're filing our Form 10.","Will Slabaugh","Got it, thank you.","Operator","All right, thank you so much. Our next question comes from Mr. Chris O'Cull from the KeyBanc. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Chris O'Cull","Thanks, guys. I just had a couple of questions. First, in terms of just operations, Gene, can you talk a little bit about how you're able to unwind deep discounting while still improving the comp, and also maybe what the margin impact of the discount reduction was? I think I may have missed that.","Gene Lee","Yes, I would say that I think we're getting a little bit -- as I talked about in the last call, I think we're getting a little bit of help from the consumer. I do think the consumer is looking for less discounting activity today than they were a year ago, or two years ago. We've had a lot of discussion around the gas, what we call the gas dividend that's going back to the consumer. I think there's a lot of expectation that that was going to stimulate traffic. What I've been saying is, we haven't seen it stimulate traffic, but we have seen it change the consumer behavior once they're in our building, and they're not seeking the deals the way they were years ago.","We're seeing some more \u2013- the consumers buy more add-ons. They're buying wine, dessert, apps. So I think that that is the environment, is helping us somewhat move away from these constructs, and we're just not finding them to be as successful as they once were, so we're able to do that.","From a margin perspective, I would say that we're picking up at probably well over a 100 basis point from reducing this heavy discount mentality or strategy, and you see that in every line in the P&L. So you have less discounts, the food cost improves, your labor cost improves.","Chris O'Cull","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, is tenant diversity more important than the single tenant with investment grade credit for this REIT? And then can you guys discuss why the company decided not to include the ground leases in the REIT?","Bill White","Yes, this is Bill. The first part is the question on tenant diversity; it's certainly something that we're focused on. If we look at the strategy for the REIT going forward, and we think that we've developed a strategy that will be very well positioned to allow -- first of all, it's got very strong geographic diversification out of the gate. But then we'll be in a good position with enough excess debt capacity to be able to fund growth, as well as diversify through 1031 asset exchanges on a very efficient basis, with some highly desirable Olive Garden properties. We've got a good strategy in place for that. And then the second part of your question on -- ","Chris O'Cull","On the ground leases.","Bill White","Yes, on the ground leases. The biggest issue, certainly something we examine carefully. The biggest issue we found with the ground lease is that they really require a commitment of locking in all of your existing option periods. In our case, 25-plus years of time that from an operating stand point really constrains and restricts your operating flexibility, to be able to go back and negotiate or renegotiate at those option periods, which have value to the operating company, as well as, frankly, just having less value, and typically not a very significant component of a REIT portfolio.","Chris O'Cull","Okay. Fair enough. And the three turns, or the three turns of coverage, does that include a standardized G&A allocation overhead allocation or is that the actual G&A allocation for Darden?","Bill White","That would be pre G&A.","Chris O'Cull","Okay, thank you.","Operator","All right, thank you so much. Our next question comes from Mr. Jason West from the Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Jason West","Yes. Thanks. Just want to understand on the dividend, you talked about the net earnings impact, about $50 million pretax, but you've also lowered CapEx quite a bit over the last few years, and wondering if you think you'd be able to pay that dividend that you're currently paying on the Darden corporate side, even with the higher rent expense that you're looking at?","Brad Richmond","Yes, so what we've said is that we will keep the -- our plan is to keep the dividend whole between the two entities, between Darden post the separation, and then within the new REIT, the absolute value. So yes, we are very confident we can preserve that dividend, and actually continue to show some nice improvement or progress with the dividend pay-out ratio.","Jason West","Okay. And can you help us understand in terms of the free cash flow outlook for the Darden entity -- so I guess in terms of the operating cash flow side, it would be the higher rent expense, the CapEx -- is any CapEx going to go away when the real estate transfers, and is that the way to look at it in those two pieces that are changing?","Brad Richmond","A lot of that is projecting pretty far forward, but what I can share is these are triple net leases. So the CapEx guidance that I gave would pretty much stay in place that we talked about for this fiscal year. It would be hard to say there's any change there. In terms of the free cash flow, the real driver there in --you see it in this particular quarter as well, is the improvement in the operating performance of the business. And then we gave you the information, that when a transaction occurs what that would do to depreciation, which is a non-cash item, but also to interest and all those. So we're projecting pretty far forward, but I think the thrust to the question on CapEx, things like that, wouldn't change. We have improving cash flows. You can add what our working guidance is right now in terms of its impact for Darden to the operating company.","Jason West","Okay. And then just one quick one, the $1 billion debt pay down, does that include paying, using the cash on the balance sheet, which is substantial right now, or is that leaving that cash alone, and you can still pay down $1 billion in debt?","Bill White","Yes, Jason, this is Bill. It does include a portion of it. The majority of that debt retirement will come out of proceeds from the real estate transactions, but there will also be a component of cash coming up from Darden's balance sheet.","Jason West","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Ms Sara Senatore from the Bernstein. Ma'am, your line is open. You may proceed.","Sara Senatore","Thank you very much. I have one question about Olive Garden and then a follow-up on the real estate, if I may. The first is on Olive Garden, just with the improvement in the profitability and the same-store sales; do you envision returning that concept to growth at some point? I think there was a time when at least prior management thought this could be a 900 to a 1,000 unit business. Is that something that you envision being the case, if operating margins and volumes, everything gets back to or better than peak? So that's my first question.","And the second question, the follow-up on the real estate, I just am trying to understand the value creation a little bit better. I understand the difference between the REIT and an operating business, but shouldn't we be comparing this to your debt? And so I guess in the sense of creating value, is it fair to assume that you think -- is the cash cap rates that you're talking about, are those better than how we should think about the debt that you're payin8g down, the effective interest rate on that? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Sara, I'll take the Olive Garden growth, and then why we handle the value creation on the REITs. As we think about Olive Garden we actually opened up a few restaurants this year that have done extremely well. So as we think about growth we need to be opportunistic. [Technical difficulty] Olive Gardens is that they impact at least one restaurant, and sometimes up to two or three restaurants because we are so fully developed. We sat with our real estate team recently and looked at opportunity areas where we could build Olive Gardens and not have any impact, and they came up with Hawaii. And I'm really not interested in opening Olive Gardens in Hawaii.","So at this point we are looking for selective areas of the country where we may be able to open five or ten Olive Gardens a year, not have major impact on our existing footprint or if we're going to impact in Olive Garden, we need to think about it around this whole notion of if we don't open this restaurant someone else is going to open the restaurant and they're going to have an impact on Olive Garden. Those are the filters that Dave and his team are running Olive Garden growth through. I think over the next few years, what we have guided Dave to try to do is to open five to ten great Olive Gardens a year. And that will continue to examine what the long-term potential for Olive Garden is. Bill?","Bill White","And Sara, to your question about the repayment of debt, we would start with just sharing with you that we think the right comparison is not between the cap rate and the interest rate. It's really between the cap rate and the cost to capital, the weighted average cost to capital for a restaurant company. So it does come back to this notion that a dollar rent is going to be worth more to a REIT than a dollar rent saved at an operating company, less so about a optimal capital structure decision, more about the decision of owning real estate. Excuse me.","So really paying down the debt allows us to do the size real estate deal that we desire we think creates the most value while not repaying the longer dated debt, and at the same time preserving the credit profile.","Sara Senatore","Thanks. I'm sorry. And just one last thing, on the CFO search, I heard you say something about July. Did I miss it? Are you, have you identified candidates that you're very close to settling on somebody?","Gene Lee","The CFO search is ongoing. We're doing a thorough search, and we have more news. We'll provide you an update.","Sara Senatore","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you as well. Well, our next question comes from Mr. John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","John Ivankoe","Hi, thank you. Just to follow-up on the CapEx, if I may. I think in 2016, the CapEx is guided at $230 million to $255 million, of which 30%, if I heard you, was refreshed technology and other. So just to look at that refresh piece of that, call it, $240 million CapEx, it definitely doesn't seem like a big number relative to your own store base. So just a little bit more color on that in terms of where you think it could go. And certainly understand in 2015, you really put the brakes on that, and in 2016, it looks like you're studying the various options that you have. But longer term, what is the right level of refresh CapEx that we should consider for your business for your own portfolio? Thanks.","Brad Richmond","Well, there's two things, John, one that the maintenance CapEx is now to keep the facilities up to the standards and expectations that we have. That amount is when you look at the size and unit the traffic that they're doing, that trend pretty consistent year-to-year. And in terms of the refresh opportunity, Gene touched some on the opportunities that we see with Olive Garden, but that work is still underway and we'll continue to evaluate that, and when we see the opportunity to invest more, that produces even greater return. We're comfortable doing that.","John Ivankoe","And maybe is it the case that your maintenance CapEx, I think, is something pretty close to D&A, that's something that we should consider over time? And this is obviously a big change relative to how Darden used to be. Does refresh by definition not have to be as big as part of the plan as it was maybe interpreted two to 12 years ago, in terms of how Darden was previously run?","Brad Richmond","Yes. Let me be clear. Through the process that we're going through we aren't really cutting maintenance CapEx. We know the importance of keeping our facilities up to the standards that we expect. And so, as we look at that over time on a per restaurant basis, quickly we take out the Red Lobster disposition and its older base. The amount that we're spending on a pre-unit basis, we felt very comfortable as consistent with what we've done and maintained the facilities to the high level that we need.","I do think that you're on to a point on the refresh that we talked about that in the past and maybe have had programs and things that one more capital than we should have spent. That's why you see Gene and Dave George in the team they're being very diligent, very cautious, taking the time to understand the money that we're putting back into the pre Tuscan farmhouse Olive Gardens and making the proper decisions there. And so are no -- there would be more updates as we get further through that.","John Ivankoe","Thank you.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays. Your line is open.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions. These are for Bill. Bill, it sounds like you said a couple times on the call that your intent is to not look to pay down the longer dated bonds. So if you can just confirm that you don't have plans to touch the 2035s or 2037s. And then as you look at paying down the rest of the bonds that are in place, would you plan to do a tender or a make whole? And then finally, just around the consent solicitation, would that be on all of the bonds that are in place or just the ones that remaining in place and what your order of operations is going to be in terms of getting the consents versus taking out the debt? Thank you.","Bill White","Yes, lot of questions in there Priya, but we are actually launching the consent process today. So our preference is to not really get into a lot of the details. They'll give us an opportunity to speak to bondholders directly which is what we will be doing. What I can't confirm for you is that yes, we'll be paying down all the debt outside of the long dated 2035, '37. The '35s and '37s, those the bondholders will be seeking consent from and more to share about that later in the day. In terms of the process that will take to retire the debt, we're still formulating that strategy.","Our first step is to speak to the long dated bondholders. And we're towards getting consent with those individuals. We should make it clear that consents not a requirement to do what we want to do, but it's certainly the preferred route.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","So what happens in the event that you don't get the consent that you seek from these long dated bondholders?","Bill White","Yes, we really feel like that what we're going to bondholders with will be able to get consent. Again it's not a requirement and our preference is to not go into those details at this stage of the game. But our intent is to have a good conversation with bondholders and work with bondholders.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","And then just one final one, if I could; what's your expected ongoing leverage of the op co, or the leverage that you're targeting as a result of all of this? Thank you.","Bill White","Yes, we would expect leverage to stay around adjusted basis approximately where we are today and even improving with the improving operating performance for delivering. So adjust debt to EBITDAR. We would expect to continue to show progress and improvement.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Thank you, so much.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Joshua Long from Piper Jaffray. Sir your line is open. You may proceed.","Joshua Long","Great. Thank you for taking the question. I was curious if you could give us an update around technology investments, either at the store level or maybe at the above store level to support some of the off-premises sales channels that you're looking at? I'm thinking that we've previously talked around maybe some table top technology in the restaurants and then maybe anything to support that to-go channel that we've been talking about as a long-term opportunity at Olive Garden.","Gene Lee","Yes, great. Technology is a big part of our plan moving forward. I will start with Ziosk. We are rolling that out in Olive Garden. We are over 100 restaurants today. Our guest and server feedback continues to be positive. We are seeing similar results or better results than our initial test sales. So, we are really excited about what we are doing with the Ziosk in Olive Garden.","We are working on web-ahead capabilities. We think that that's going to be an important part going into the future. People are going to be want to be able to put their name on sort of list. Ahead of time, they want to know what the weight is. It's all building on the convenience trend, that's important. We are trying, one of our goals in Olive Garden because we do have a lot of overcapacity on the weekend is how do we improve the wait. So one of the technological things we are doing is we are putting screens in the lobby, so people can see where they are in the wait, and the initial feedback from that has been really, really positive.","A lot of other technological investments right now are around CRM. And we are working with a partner to continue to move that forward. We are in the early phases, discovery phases of developing a loyalty program, so a lot of energy and effort there. We are also looking at -- from a technology standpoint, looking at out PoS systems in restaurants trying to figure out what's the best way to go forward there. That's really it from a technology standpoint at this point in time.","Joshua Long","That's very helpful. And generally speaking, can we think of this as maybe an Olive Garden first approach, and then with a lot of these initiatives maybe being adapted to your other brands in your portfolios over time?","Gene Lee","Well, some of the technology stuff that we are doing has to be implemented on the other brands. Olive Garden only has so much capacity. So we are doing a lot of web-ahead in LongHorn. And we look at each brand and say, \"Okay, who has the capacity to do this to run the test, so we can get the results,\" so that the burden isn't always on Olive Garden in the testing process.","Joshua Long","Thank you.","Operator","All right. Thank you so much. Our next questions from Mr. Joseph Buckley of the Bank of America. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Joseph Buckley","Thank you for coming back to me. I just wanted to ask a couple on the REIT. Is it going to be a triple net lease structure? And could you give us some help on the rent breakdown between the properties in the REIT and properties being done in the sale leaseback transactions?","Bill White","Joe, this is Bill. It will be a triple net structure and we are not quite in a position to be able to give you the breakdown yet amongst, we have given you the total rental, number of properties, we are still formulating the exact mix and trying to do, take all the steps to be prepared to know what the cost structure and other things will look like for the new REIT. So, we are just not quite in a position to go into the level of detail with you here today.","Joseph Buckley","From our seat, is it appropriate to think of it as an equal split, based on the number of restaurants in the two different transaction structures? Or is it something unique about the sale leaseback properties that would skew that?","Bill White","No, I think that's a fair assumption, the only asset obviously in that mix is slightly lumpy to be our restaurant support center, but beyond that I think that's a very reasonable assumption.","Joseph Buckley","Okay. And the $50 million incentive GAAP number, the pretax impact?","Bill White","It is.","Joseph Buckley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","All right. Thank you so much Mr. Buckley. Our next question on queue comes from Mr. Jason West from the Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Jason West","Yes. Thanks for letting us do some follow-ups. So one, on what Joe just asked about the pretax earnings impact, are you guys planning to call out the non-cash rent as sort of a one-time item in the earnings or are you planning to leave that in as the adjusted earnings?","Brad Richmond","I think it's going to be on a GAAP basis. Once the transaction is complete, and we again aren't sure about the exact timing of that. So it's a little ways out, but as always the case even today with the facilities we have, our GAAP number that's on our P&Ls and then the cash that goes to the cash flow statement that will continue to go forward. I don't think there will be a need to call out that difference.","Jason West","Okay. And can you explain again, I'm sorry if I missed it, how the $1 billion debt pay down proceeds, we know a portion of it is the balance sheet cash, a portion of it is the sale leaseback. And is there some expectation that you'll receive a distribution from the REIT as a portion of that, as well? Would that be a distribution if the REIT issues securities, or are you saying if you hold on to a portion of the REIT, you'll get distributions from the dividend payments from the REIT?","Bill White","Yes, Jason, this is Bill. You're right on track. It's actually there will be a distribution from the REIT. The REIT will raise some debt, and send a distribution back at the point of spin or at the point of separation. That will come back to Darden and that will be one of the components. So the timing on some of that we would obviously expect to see some of the sale leaseback proceeds sooner. And then at the point of the separation, we will call it in the fall of this calendar year, that's when we see that distribution back from the REIT, and then addition to a component coming from Darden's balance sheet cash to satisfy that debt retirement.","Jason West","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you so much. Well, at this time there are no further questions on queue. I'd like to hand the call back to the speakers. Gentlemen, you may proceed.","Rick Cardenas","Well, thank you all for your time and attention today. As a reminder, we plan to release fiscal 2016 first quarter earnings on Tuesday, September 22. Have a great day, and have a great summer.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."],"7121":["Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) Q1 2015 Earnings Call September 12, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Matthew V.

We released first quarter earnings this morning. These results were available on PR Newswire and other wire services.","Brad will review the P&L in some detail and discuss our financial outlook for fiscal 2015, then Gene will discuss the operating performance, summary of the brands. And after Gene speaks, we'll take your questions.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad.","C. Bradford Richmond","Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter financial results were slightly ahead of what we expected when we released our quarterly guidance in August, largely because of the better same-restaurant sales performance at Olive Garden in the last 2 weeks of the fiscal month. As we reported this morning, our diluted net loss per share from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.14. On an adjusted basis, our diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for the fiscal first quarter were $0.32. The adjusted results excluded approximately $0.02 of the Red Lobster-related shared support costs incurred in June and July that moved to Red Lobster with the sale of that business, approximately $0.03 of costs related to other aspects of the company's strategic action plan, approximately $0.04 related to restaurant impairment charges, and approximately $0.37 of debt breakage costs related to the planned retirement of $1 billion of the company's debt.","Darden's first quarter sales from continuing operations increased 4.2% to $1.6 billion. On a same-restaurant sales basis, LongHorn Steakhouse increased 2.8%, while Olive Garden declined 1.3% for the quarter. And we saw continued same-restaurant sales gains in our Specialty Restaurant Group, with a 2.1% increase in same-restaurant sales on a blended basis.","Food and beverage expenses for the first quarter were approximately 180 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis. This unfavorability, which we expect to largely subside as the fiscal year progresses, was driven by 3 factors: First, dairy, seafood and beef costs were sharply higher on a year-over-year basis. And we expect some of this to continue through the end of the calendar year. Second, year-over-year Olive Garden promotional margins were unfavorable. However we don't expect this to continue given our plans for the rest of the fiscal year. Third, while the core menu enhancement at Olive Garden that we made last February served to broaden its appeal, they do have a slightly unfavorable impact on cost of sales as a percentage of sales.","For the first quarter, restaurant labor expenses were approximately 20 basis points lower than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to sales leveraging. Restaurant expenses in the quarter were approximately 10 basis points lower than last year due to preopening and sales leveraging. Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 80 basis points lower on a percentage of sales basis, due to sales leverage and the impact of our cost savings initiatives that we have undertaken in the past year.","There are an additional 50 basis points of costs associated with the shared services that transferred to Red Lobster and the strategic action plan cost included in this line item. So excluding these items, SG&A expenses would have been 9.5% of sales in the first quarter.","Depreciation expense in the quarter was approximately 10 basis points higher on a percentage of sales basis compared to last year, because of the increase in new units. Interest expense is 480 basis points higher than last year, as a result of breakage costs of approximately $80 million related to the retirement of $900 million of the company's debt. There will be an additional $100 million of debt retirement at the beginning of our fiscal second quarter, which will also have an incremental breakage cost of approximately $10 million.","Now there are a number of moving parts of interest expense for this quarter. But as we look forward, we expect interest expense in the low-$20 million each quarter.","Our tax rate this quarter was driven by earnings loss attributable to the aforementioned breakage costs -- or debt breakage cost. The Q1 tax rate was about 18% to 20% when you adjust for that -- adjust out that cost for the debt retirement. We now estimate that our annual effective tax rate will be approximately 10%. This annual effective rate will vary though from quarter-to-quarter, and as you look at our adjustments, I would mention that our marginal tax rate does remain at approximately 38% as we look forward.","Now turning to our commodity cost outlook. We have approximately 74% of our total food spend contracted through the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and 38% of our total spend through the end of our fiscal year, which is about normal at this point in the cycle for us. We have not fully covered our usage through the fiscal year, because we believe the premiums for future contracts are too great given what we expect prices to be in the cash market as we look forward.","Food cost inflation in the first quarter, net of cost savings, was approximately 3.9%, driven by the dairy and food -- seafood inflation in the high teens. For the fiscal year, our current expectation is that our commodity basket will see net inflation in the range of 2% to 2.5%, which is at the higher end of the range we anticipated in June. We anticipate that food cost inflation will moderate in calendar 2015. That's the second half of our fiscal year.","Category-by-category, through the second quarter of fiscal 2015, beef costs are higher on a year-over-year basis with 55% of our usage covered. Seafood costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with 92% of our usage covered. Poultry costs are lower on a year-over-year basis, with 95% of our usage covered. Wheat costs are lower on a year-over-year basis, with 100% of our usage covered now. And dairy costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with 50% of our usage covered. Our energy costs are expected to be slightly unfavorable on a year-over-year basis. And we have contracted the majority of our natural gas and electricity usage in the deregulated markets in which we operate for the second quarter of fiscal 2015.","As we look ahead to the fiscal year, our outlook for total sales and earnings remains the same as it was when we spoke to you at the beginning of the first quarter. We expect same-restaurant sales growth for Olive Garden to be flat to plus 1%, LongHorn Steakhouse of plus 1% to plus 2%, and our Specialty Restaurants at approximately plus 2%. We anticipate diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.74 to $1.84 for fiscal 2015, consistent with our previous expectations that adjusted for the shared support costs included -- part of the sale of Red Lobster that moved with Red Lobster for the sale; the costs we'll continue to incur in connection with the implementation of our strategic action plan; asset impairment and the debt breakage costs incurred in the first quarter and some that occur in the second quarter. Adjusting for these items, we continue to anticipate diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.22 to $2.30 for the year, which excludes the costs I just mentioned.","And now with that, I'll turn it over to Gene to comment on Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and the Specialty Restaurants.","Eugene I. Lee","Thanks, Brad, and good morning. Let's start with Olive Garden's first quarter performance and our progress on the Brand Renaissance.","First quarter total sales of $914 million were 0.5% below last year. Sales decline was driven by a same-restaurant sales decrease of 1.3% for the quarter, which was 70 basis points below the industry benchmark, but an improvement of 250 basis points versus the previous quarter's industry sales gap. Same-restaurant guest counts were down 2.4%, which was 40 basis points better than the industry benchmark and an improvement of 240 basis points versus the previous quarter's industry guest count gap.","Same-restaurant sales and guest counts remain volatile week-to-week, as we continue to adjust the marketing calendar. One of our objectives is to realign the marketing calendar with the seasonality of the business. Over the past few years, for example, our Never Ending Pasta Bowl promotion, which is most appropriate for the fall, which is seasonally slow, has drifted into August, a seasonally strong month. This year, we pushed the start of the Never Ending Pasta Bowl back into September.","Overall, we're encouraged with the progress we're making with the Olive Garden Brand Renaissance. There are 4 key aspects of the plan: one, continue to evolve the core menu to reinforce value, expand choice and variety and capitalize on the convenience trend; two, simplifying operations, improving food quality and enhancing service; three, implementing a more integrated communication platform to enhance brand relevance; and four, bringing the brand to life with every touchpoint.","We introduced new lunch and dinner menus 6 months ago with a goal of reinforcing value and expanding variety. As I've stated in the past, we believe adding a $9.99 Cucina Mia section to the menu was an important -- for Olive Garden to maintain its value leadership position. Preference for this section continues to grow and has doubled since its introduction. More importantly, we know through our transactional data that guests are returning and repurchasing this menu item and that it appeals to millennials. The new menu is also successfully delivering better value at the high end of the net -- menu, with higher-quality beef and seafood selections. Key attributes on taste, food quality and good value for the money continue to improve.","Additionally, with this new menu and taking less price in the industry the last 2 years, we are seeing reduced price sensitivity from our guests. To-Go sales are exceeding expectations. We've strengthened our To-Go experience and completed online ordering ahead of schedule, which resulted in a 13% increase in To-Go sales versus last year. In recent weeks, To-Go sales have grown at approximately 20% on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see a 30% increase in check average when guests order online.","Our operation team is focused on delivering consistently great experiences through an intensified emphasis on service and food quality. In the first quarter, the great food goal rally cry was launch, with the initial concentration on improving execution of our soup, salad and breadsticks. In the second quarter, the team will focus on continuing to deliver great pasta, prepared passionately and plated perfectly. Through the focus on Pronto Lunch, lunch dining times have improved for guests seeking a quicker experience. In addition, with better forecasting and scheduling, we've improved the wait times.","We continue to make progress implementing a more integrated communication platform. We've broadened our reach by combining price point and promotions with new secondary television and digital equity messages that reinforce our culinary credentials. The promotional strategy continues to evolve, as we better leverage menu items from our core menu and offer compelling buy-up opportunities for our guests. And as I mentioned earlier, we will continue to realign the marketing calendar with the seasonality of the business.","Additionally, the new social media team is actively engaged in realtime conversations with our guests, talking with them, not at them. Today's social-savvy consumer expects this type of interaction, and our social team is doing an outstanding job.","The first 3 remodels, which also included the new logo, signage, menu and plateware, are generating excitement with our guests and team members. We're pleased with the initial guest count results, as these 3 restaurants are now trending greater than 10% above their prior trends. In addition to the guest count lift, we're also seeing an increase in alcoholic beverage sales.","Our plan is to complete 75 remodels this fiscal year. And as a reminder, the 300 restaurants in need of a remodel lag our other restaurants by approximately 200 basis points in same-restaurant sales.","The Ziosk test is now in 11 restaurants, and initial results are very positive. 80% of our guests are interacting with the device, and 60% of them are paying their check on the tablet. In addition we've seen an increase in add-on sales, e-CLUB sign up, guest survey response, and our server tip percentage has increased. We're developing a plan to implement the tablets in the rest of the system and plan to be completed by the end of the fiscal year.","There are real signs of positive momentum with our operational leaders and team member engagement. We held our first national directors of operation meeting in 3 years and focused on driving sales growth through great dining experiences. We've also just completed our general manager conference, where the leadership team did an outstanding job communicating the opportunities for improvement, while energizing the group to improve overall operational execution.","While we're pleased with the progress we've made to date with the Brand Renaissance, there's still work to do. This is a large and complex initiative with many components, and we're confident that the rate of progress will accelerate in the quarters ahead as various aspects of the plan reinforce and build on one another.","The LongHorn Steakhouse had a strong first quarter with same-restaurant sales of 2.8%, exceeding the industry benchmark for the sixth consecutive quarter. Importantly, this top line performance was matched buy significantly higher operating profit and restaurant earnings versus the prior year. This balanced sales and earnings growth was achieved through a combination of operational execution and compelling marketing initiatives.","Operationally, our restaurant teams continue to elevate the guest experience, as evidenced by higher scores on the key metrics of steaks cooked correctly and server attentiveness. Industry-leading low turnover and a slowdown on new restaurant growth has enabled our restaurant teams to focus even more than before on executing every shift flawlessly and ensuring service that over-delivers on our guests' expectations.","Successful marketing strategies are also a key driver of maintaining top line momentum for LongHorn. The first quarter was supported by 2 very different promotions that both delivered competitively superior results. We began the quarter with our Grilled Taste of Summer promotion, which leveraged our Chef's Showcase platform we launched last year, featuring seasonally appropriate, unique new entr\u00e9es. This promotion included grilled lobster chops, fire-grilled Hawaiian ribeye, and brown butter-lemon tilapia and grilled shrimp. Our second promotion of the core, Steaks Across America, starting at $12.99, was a little closer to home, and it featured a Kansas City's barbecued sirloin, a Texas 3-chili ribeye and Manhattan Stuffed Mushroom Filet. Both of these promotions delivered same-restaurant performance significantly above the industry benchmark.","Our culinary and operations teams also partnered to let [ph] some exciting menu enhancements in the first quarter. Bold Bites, LongHorn's version of small plates, and Happy Hour both launched in June. Guest response has exceeded our expectations and these menu enhancements are proving to be both guest satisfying and profit-driving platforms for LongHorn.","We're confident that LongHorn is on the right path and well positioned to continue to deliver the industry-leading same-restaurant sales performance that it consistently achieved over the last 2 years. In addition to continuing the top line momentum at LongHorn, the team is focused on leveraging the top line growth to deliver strong earnings performance","Specialty Restaurant Group had another good quarter, with same-restaurant sales growth of 2.1% and total sales growth of 14.5%. The capital growth continues to deliver strong same-restaurant sales growth and earnings performance, while capitalizing on the opportunities to add new restaurants. The team is committed to delivering a unique service experience, combined with an evolving culinary experience, rooted in traditional steakhouse style. The Yard House same-restaurant sales have improved, as the team moves past integration and focuses on operational improvement. The culinary team is refreshing the menu with new and exciting items and is also reenergizing their late night Happy Hour, which is an important daypart.","Seasons 52's plan to regain momentum is on track. We're starting to see improved results as August same-restaurant sales increased 2.9%. With new restaurant growth slowing, the operations teams are focused on improving the entire guest experience. The team also has enhanced the menu with new unique flatbreads, appetizers, salads and entr\u00e9es, which have been well received by our guests.","Bahama Breeze continues to perform well, with solid same-restaurant sales growth in the quarter. Same-restaurant sales growth did decelerate some this quarter as we adjusted our discounting strategy. Our earnings significantly improved year-over-year.","Eddie V's continues to build momentum with solid same-restaurant sales growth in the quarter. The team continues to elevate its service levels and ensure culinary excellence. We will continue to look for the appropriate real estate to develop this brand.","A lot of the initiatives I've touched upon this morning are things we've discussed for some time, but you need to know that much of that time line is involved in the development and testing. Now these initiatives are being experienced by our guests and they're moving the needle on guest satisfaction scores, and I'm confident that will continue. One reason I'm confident is that we have such skilled and committed people. They have embraced change with enthusiasm and I could not be more proud of them.","Matthew now has some additional information to share before Q&A.","Matthew V. Stroud","Thanks, Gene. Before we turn to the Q&A, I would like to briefly discuss Darden's upcoming 2014 Annual Meeting. We've been speaking, and will continue to speak, directly with many of Darden's shareholders to hear firsthand what they think about the future direction and leadership of the company, and about Starboard's efforts to take effective control of the company by replacing all 12 of Darden's directors with Starboard's own preferred nominees and having them influence Starboard's plans.","We believe that while many shareholders believe in the importance of having a board and leadership team who have a deep understanding of the company and its strategic shifts over time, they also believe that Darden would benefit from new perspectives. We also believe that many Darden shareholders have concerns about the risks and destabilization that would result from full board turnover and giving control to a single shareholder's nominees. We believe these risks are particularly acute, given the positive momentum we are achieving across our brands, including at Olive Garden, and given the potential adverse effects of giving Starboard control would have on our ability to recruit the best person to serve as the company's next Chief Executive Officer.","The Darden board is committed to looking at the company with a fresh perspective and recently announced a new slate that aligns with that priority. Darden's new slate includes 4 new, highly-qualified independent nominees, unaffiliated with the company or Starboard, who bring relevant industry business and CEO experience; 4 highly-qualified, continuing independent director nominees, who provide important and deep understanding of the company's operations and the shifts in the industry and consumer trends over time and who have a record of taking proactive, decisive action to best position Darden for continued improvement and success; and 4 seats to be filled by candidates proposed by Starboard, therefore providing Starboard with a meaningful opportunity to participate in the decisions regarding Darden's strategic direction, including the selection of the company's next Chief Executive Officer.","Under this reconstituted board, 8 of Darden's 12 independent directors will be new to the board this year. We believe this is a balanced slate that serves the best interests of all Darden shareholders and is also designed to avoid what we believe are significant risks associated with a full board turnover that Starboard is seeking. We look forward to talking more about Darden's slate of directors, nominees and the board's recommendation for the annual meeting over the coming weeks.","The purpose of today's call, however, is to discuss our earnings results. So we ask that you please keep your questions focused on that topic. We thank you for your cooperation in that regard.","Now we'll open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from Jeff Bernstein at Barclays. [Operator Instructions]","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Did have one question and one follow-up. First on the core savings side of things. There's been a lot of discussion about opportunities to further reduce your cost structure on a variety of lines, but I know you guys are giving guidance specific to G&A. I think for this year, you were initially talking about maybe $60 million and then talk about upside to that. Was wondering if you can give us kind of an update where you stand in terms of expectations, whether it's just in the different buckets. I know you've mentioned the operating overhead and optimization of support and direct costs. Just wondering when we should expect kind of an update on that. I know you have third parties working on it, so just wondering if we could get any preliminary feedback or takeaways from that thus far.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, this -- Jeff, this is Brad. And I'll start with your question there. Yes, you're correct and our focus has principally been on our support structure to the restaurants, which appears on the G&A line. I think over time, if you look at some of the big initiatives, they've been fairly broad based around the whole supply chain, around direct labor optimizations. So we've touched the whole P&L. Those programs continue to move forward.","But as you mentioned, we brought in outside expertise to help us look at the entire business. That engagement is ongoing. And so we do see future opportunity there to make progress. But most importantly, to make that progress without affecting the guest experience. It's very critical that we approach that delicately, but with some swiftness and with some certainty of the costs that we can get out of that. And so that work is ongoing. We continue to narrow that down. And as we completed the separation of Red Lobster, I would -- you should expect to see us moving more quickly on that front now.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then just the follow-up. I know you mentioned, essentially your fiscal '15 guidance is unchanged. I know back in August, you were doing something unusual for you guys in terms of giving us quarterly numbers, and at the time, essentially brought down early estimates for the year and, therefore, led to kind of a bump up in the back half. I'm just wondering if you could talk about that meaningful acceleration the rest of the year from here. I mean, how much of it is predicated on the Olive Garden turn versus maybe the incremental benefit from repo and lower interest going forward? Or are there other unusuals that we should know about that leads to the outsized earnings growth kind of in the back half, just give us a little bit more color on the seasonality of the trend.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, I mean, there is progression throughout the year as you look at a quarterly basis. Some of that is fairly simple and straightforward. So let me deal with those first. There's the extra week, the 53rd week, that benefit all crews in the fourth quarter, so obviously a meaningful impact there. Our debt paydown, which reduces interest. We look at interest expense now being that low-$20 million range on a quarterly basis. We don't have that impact at all in the first quarter. We just paid that down near the end of the quarter, and then some that gets paid down actually, in our fiscal second quarter. So you'll see interest expense interest went down to the -- pretty significantly there. And then additional use of the proceeds from the share buyback. Because with all that's been going on, that program is just now starting to get in place and so the benefit of a reduced share count will accrue mainly to the back half our fiscal year. So that's the mechanical items, if you will.","But I think that the key thing is the progress that we're seeing on our brand work, particularly with Olive Garden. If you look at it on a sequential basis, we continue to make an improvement. And so we do expect that to continue, and that's also a driver of the business. Along with the continued strong performance from LongHorn and our Specialty Restaurant Group. We expect that to continue near the levels it's currently at.","Eugene I. Lee","And Jeff, I would just add that in the third and fourth quarter, we expect a little less pressure on inflation, as we get past seafood and dairy, which were big impacts in the first quarter and will run in the second quarter a little bit.","C. Bradford Richmond","And obviously, the other key item I forgot was last year's pretty unusual winter weather. It affected principally our third quarter. And so I think that's kind of the top line color, if you will, on the quarterly progressions and the drivers of that.","Operator","Our next question will be from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Gene, a question on the Olive Garden Renaissance plan and your efforts around the operations side. And just wondering if you could elaborate on your plan to improve the execution at the unit level? And then maybe secondarily, one of the ideas that's been floated is to simplify the menu and change some of your food prep processes. And I'm just wondering if you could comment on whether that's something that you'd be interested in looking at or not, as it relates to the unit level operations?","Eugene I. Lee","Yes, as far -- so let's start with ops ex [ph] -- execution. It's my belief that we need to go back to basics operationally and ensure that we set the standards -- the standards appropriately and then we work against meeting those standards. As I said in my comments, we've been focusing the last month just on breadsticks and improving our processes around that, including how well do we cook the breadsticks, how long do we hold it, how many do we serve. And now we're moving to pasta this month, and we're just systematically going through and hitting the most important things in the operation and improving our execution. We're working on staffing and scheduling to ensure that we're properly staffed to be able to deliver the experiences that we want to deliver in Olive Garden and we're making some progress there. So to me it's about back to basics. And we just need to do the basic things right every single day, and we need to energize our operations people, energize them and then also enable them to have the time to spend on improving the basics.","As far as process, we are analyzing all the options in the back of the house to improve the overall process. We're open to readjusting those processes. We want to ensure that as we look at them, not only do we maintain the quality of the food products that we prepare today, but also the pride factor in the restaurant. And one of the biggest things that I've learned over the years in this business is that, as you change processes in the back, the people that are most impacted by that sometimes are your service people. And we have to really be careful how we work our way through that. But the answer to your question is we are, as we sit here today, looking at all those processes. We are looking at the possibility of outsourcing some of our production work. And it's going to take us some time to make sure that we make the correct decisions. I expect that we'll have some tests going here in the next 3 to 6 months, but that is something that we are definitely open to and we are pursuing and have been pursuing in the last -- since the last 6 months.","Operator","Will Slabaugh of Stephens, you may ask your question.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the guidance for the year and the margin. So after 1Q, it looks like your margins at the restaurant level need to grow at least modestly on a year-over-year basis to hit that guidance number. Just wondering if you expect to see that restaurant level margin expansion for the remainder of the year after the compression we experienced in 1Q?","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, I think as we look to the quarter, and Gene touched on it some there, was the commodity cost pressures, the dairy had been pretty extreme. We're at record levels for the dairy. And so that will abate, particularly as we get towards the end of the calendar year. So that will enable restaurant margins to improve it. Principally, it's affecting Olive Garden. But as we look sequentially through the quarters, we see restaurant earnings at levels, on a percentage basis, above the prior year. We would expect that to continue. And so I think the progress that Gene was talking about driving at Olive Garden is real -- the driver behind that beyond the higher commodity costs we have in the first part of the year.","I think one thing -- and I'll go back a little bit to Jeff's question as well. The progression during the year is the share buyback from when we talked in June was delayed some, so there is less benefit coming from the share buyback within this fiscal year. The ultimate benefit is, obviously, still the same. But we've been making that up with operating performance as well. And so we like what we're seeing developing in the operating front.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Got you. And just a quick follow-up if we look at the pricing in terms of those levels at Olive Garden. Do you feel like the new core menu has established an effective everyday value platform that you can now utilize to drive traffic in its own right? Or do you think the customers are still looking for something, maybe at a lower price point, to get them in the door on a more frequent basis?","Eugene I. Lee","I think -- well, I think it's a combination of both. We do believe having an everyday $9.99 price point will allow us over time, to be less aggressive with our promotional activity and also allow us to migrate away from the price certainty that we've had for the past couple of years with our promotions and more or less starting at price point, which we've utilized the last couple of windows. And so we actually -- we think this $9.99 price point plays a big, big role. Because as a consumer, if you know it's there, you can be brought in by a promotional activity but then you can default back to it, if that's the price that you want to be at. And so when I mentioned the price sensitivity in my comments, we think that, that having that $9.99 price point is enabling us to, in the future, maybe be able to take a little bit more price and hold that $9.99 price point for the consumer that want to trade down into that menu item.","Operator","The next question is from David Palmer, RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The high overhead, the high G&A and the low advertising spending effectiveness, that's already gotten some attention from Darden and the Street. But a more controversial point made by the activists in its presentation is that Darden, and Olive Garden specifically, is an under-earner at the restaurant level due to both food and labor, representing over $100 million in opportunity. Do you see a similar Olive Garden efficiency upside? And perhaps, net of that, do you believe that you might have to reinvest some of those savings to really establish long-term, sustained, same-store sales traction?","Eugene I. Lee","David, it's Gene. I think we've been making these investments in the last couple of years. I think the $9.99 price point is an investment that we've made as we move forward. I don't think that we have to continue to make investments in our menu. I think the value proposition is as strong as it has been in the last 3 years. I think the upside will continue to come from culinary innovation. But operational execution, I think, as we continue to operate and improve our day-to-day operations and create great value visits, that we can grow the business without making further investments into cost of sales or labor.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, I would just add to Gene's comment there. When you look at the Olive Garden's business model and its particular strengths, as Gene mentioned, we've made a lot of investments already into that business to drive the top line. It takes a while for that to get there, but we're seeing the signs of that, that we like. But we don't see the way to really drive shareholder value by taking tremendous cost from where we are today out of that business.","We think where we are today, we can grow the top line, maintaining the percentages where they are growing, and some because of the natural leveraging that comes with that, but really drives total, absolute cash flow, which translates into shareholder value. So the success from where we are and the platform that we have now is largely about driving the top line now, not highly focused on taking food off the plate from the consumers or less labor in the restaurant. We just don't see that as the way to get there.","That being said, there are ways that we continue to explore, to be smart about our seafood purchasing, to be smarter around direct labor and optimizing that. But this broadly taking cost out of there is something that we're very hesitant to do. We always look at it, but we're hesitant to act on many of those type of initiatives.","Eugene I. Lee","David, I would just add that as operators, we're always trying to figure how to improve our margins. But when I look at the Olive Garden P&L, it's about an absolute EBITDA per restaurant that's exciting. And so we're talking -- we're starting with $4.4 million in average unit volumes, and I think that we got to protect that AUV and grow that AUV, and obviously try to improve margins, but there's a healthy cash flow per -- absolute cash flow per restaurant today.","Operator","Next question is from Matt DiFrisco, Buckingham Research.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Gene, I have a little bit of a follow-up on and I think one of the other things that a lot of other peers and concepts and some of the other investors have also suggested with respect to your portfolio, there's an opportunity, maybe, to trim the menu a little bit. And I was wondering if you could speak to that. I guess in your reference from being with something like a LongHorn back when it was rare and its evolution now, and Olive Garden also, with your tenure at Darden, do you -- is there a case to be said that maybe the menu has gotten too big, too complex and some of the labor savings that might come with that? Some of your smaller peers, like BJRI who, as an activist, is already trying to trim their menu a little bit. Have we -- is that an industry trend that you think you could capitalize on as well, where maybe the labor savings are more back-of-the-house facing and less customer-facing. And then the follow-up to that is, what do you have as far as -- that would refute that, that would say \"No, we would sacrifice the sales in that $4 million AUV that you spoke of because depend on the variety and that is where we score. We can't risk taking that menu down.\"","Eugene I. Lee","No, I think what you're talking about is something that Dave George and Val Insignares and I talk about every single day is, how do we continue to simplify our menu offerings and maintain our high variety ratings. And we do not -- we want to continue to simplify. We don't want to add complexity to the menu. As we rolled out the menu in Olive Garden 6 months ago, we knew we had -- we got too broad. But it's tough to take -- in casual dining, it's tough to take items off the menu. Everybody has their favorite menu item, and so we have to be very strategic as we do that. And one of Dave's projects right now in Olive Garden is saying, \"How do I decrease this menu by 20%? How do I maximize my SKUs? How do I ensure that when I'm in a category, I don't have too many menu items doing the exact same thing?\" So how do I ensure I don't have too many pasta, cheese and red sauce, and so on and so forth? So you are right on there. That's something that we'll continue to work on, but we also know that when you start pulling back the number of menu items, especially when you get away from entr\u00e9es, it is has a direct correlation to sales. And when you have -- there's -- when you have 8 appetizers on a menu versus 6, you sell more appetizers with 8, even when those appetizers are still in the similar gap. And so there's a real balance here that we have to watch, but the ultimate objective is as you described. We need to continue to simplify our menus, simplify our processes in how we prepare the food, and then how we deliver it. And it is something that we talk about here every single day.","C. Bradford Richmond","Matt, the thing that I would add to Gene's comment and having been there and seen a lot of these from the financial perspective is, you need to maximize each section of the menu, and you have to optimize the total menu because -- particularly in Olive Garden's case, when you have a brand that's $3.6 billion, $3.7 billion and driving AUVs of $4.4 billion, you have to be very broad and appealing. And so you have to have that array to do that. I think Gene said -- as he said, getting the right items for each [ph] section, clearly there's opportunity to continue to work on that. And guest taste, guest preference change and evolve over time, so you need to move with that pace to do that. And so for us, from a financial perspective, it's more about maximizing, getting the total dollars versus trying to scale it down, maybe get better percentages, but you've got a smaller business. And I think that's been the hallmark of Olive Garden for so long, is the absolute breadth of appeal of that brand and the absolute total dollars on a per unit or for the total brand that, that business can drive, provides a lot of earnings power, a lot of cash flow.","Eugene I. Lee","Then Matt, I would just -- I would finish this comment with, when we look at LongHorn against its major competitor, even though we may have more menu items today, our variety scores are lower. And so strategically, we, in LongHorn, continue to try to increase our variety scores to make ourselves available for more occasions.","Operator","Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, you may ask your question.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of technical questions first. You mentioned, Brad, a 10% effective tax rate for the adjusted earnings. Is that what you're thinking for the full year? And could you elaborate again or maybe give us more detail on what the first quarter was?","C. Bradford Richmond","Sure. So in the first quarter, if you were to take out all the adjustments, it's about an 18% effective tax rate. Obviously, you've got the debt breakage and there's different accounting treatment for that, but 18%. If you look out to the full year, our expectation is around 10%, when you consider these type of entries in there.","I think the key thing, as you look forward and run with the margin rates, so what's the additional earnings or some of the adjustments, that continues to be at 38%. So if you're trying to build your models, different scenarios, those would be the rates that you'd want to use. Is that what you're looking for?","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So yes, right. So lowering that from 12% to 10% implies the operating income is lower than your original expectations, is that correct?","C. Bradford Richmond","No, as I mentioned, operating earnings are actually higher than what we thought at the beginning of the year, but we had the delayed impact of the share repurchase. And on a GAAP-reported basis, we actually have more debt breakage cost. Now it's more economically feasible because we could optimize who you wanted to surrender their bonds, so the cash cost was less and we get better going forward interest expense out of it. But no, operating performance, from where we began the year, is better. It's these other items that are providing less lift to our guidance.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and then just one more. Gene, I think you mentioned matching the marketing cost with the seasonality of the business. So is that why this second quarter, the November quarter, EPS numbers look high relative to historical standards because the marketing spend will be down significantly year-over-year?","Eugene I. Lee","No, the marketing spend will not be down significantly in Q2. I got some people checking numbers here, but I believe we're pretty flat year-over-year in OG.","C. Bradford Richmond","That's correct.","Eugene I. Lee","That's correct. I think the second quarter has more of a brand mix, right?","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, I mean, if you're looking on a year-over-year basis, pulling out the Red Lobster piece, it's a key driver ahead of seasonality with a much greater dip in the second quarter, a stronger third quarter. And so if you're looking at previous numbers, that drives part of it.","I think when you look at the guidance, we'll have the full impact of the debt reduction while beginning to see the impact of the share buybacks that are there. But it's really more -- continued margin improvements largely than the G&A reductions on a year-over-year basis -- or SG&A reductions on a year-over-year basis. And then as we talked about a little bit earlier, the mitigation on the year-over-year basis of the commodity costs, getting more back to that 2% range versus nearly 4% in the current quarter.","Operator","We have a question from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. Can you guys share your thoughts on the health, I guess, or the state of the new product pipeline in Olive Garden? I'm only asking because it looks like -- I think it was the new Alfredo 3-course promotion contributed to roughly a 4% traffic decline in July, lapping a pretty favorable 8% decline in the year-ago month.","Eugene I. Lee","Yes, the product pipeline is robust right now. We actually have a lot of products sitting on the shelf that we can pull out. We went back in July to Alfredo because it's the item that guests like the most. Well, we went 3-course against 2-for-$25, which wasn't as strong. And so there's was a promotional mismatch in July. We also moved some media around, and on top of what was a really tough 3 weeks for the industry, we did not -- the end of -- the last week in June and the first 2 weeks in July, we did not perform well. But I don't believe that had a whole lot do with the strength on that 3-course. The 3-course performed fairly well compared against our 3-course in the past, and we used -- and using Alfredo really, really helped us.","It hurt us from a profitability standpoint because of the dairy spike. If we had known that dairy was going to be the levels it was at, we wouldn't have done it at that time. But very, very popular promotion, high preference, high guest satisfaction. But I do feel as though our pipeline is in really good shape and that the promotional -- our promotional activity I think has been pretty effective.","Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then, just to follow up on that. And again, you've highlighted this a couple of times in the call. But Olive Garden's results, clearly volatile intra-quarter, do show that there's still significant month-to-month, again, volatility. Looks to me like driven by that promotional calendar based on what you just said. But what is the latest thinking or strategy around reducing some of that volatility? You mentioned Cucina Mia section of the menu. Stable, everyday value might be something that can help. But what's the longer-term game plan here in terms of really getting -- or meaningfully reducing that volatility month-to-month?","Eugene I. Lee","I think the key is to get the promotions that we've historically run, which are still very popular, like Never Ending Pasta Bowl, back into periods where they make sense. So the Never Ending Pasta Bowl makes sense in September. Our volumes are a little bit lower than our average. There's capacity for us to handle the extra volume that the promotion drives. It didn't make sense to be doing it at the last 2 weeks of August, when our restaurants are fairly -- are really busy. And that really worked out well for us this year, both from a sales and profitability standpoint. So once we get the calendar back to where we want to -- and we believe by this time next year, we'll have the calendar aligned and matched up year-to-year, and we won't be moving it back and forth. And we won't be -- yes.","C. Bradford Richmond","Jeff, I would just add, that's why we had that quarterly guidance that's out there, because some of this variability is driven by the changes that Gene has talked about -- in Olive Garden's case, moving Never Ending Pasta Bowl. It's clearly the right decision to do. It did create some variability around the menu mix and traffic, but net-net, we think it's a better place to be. And as we've said, the last 2 weeks of August, we were wrapping on the Never Ending Pasta Bowl last year. We're actually -- provided some upside to our expectations. So some of it what's going on in the industry, but some of this is volatility that we are introducing because it's the right thing to do.","Operator","Next, we'll have Keith Siegner of UPS -- UBS.","Keith Siegner - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Gene, if I could just follow up a little bit on some of that week-to-week volatility at Olive Garden. I mean, the delta from July's numbers to the back half of August is pretty meaningful. And I mean, was this really just the cadence of promos against promos? I mean, the back half of August this year had the return of the Buy One, Take One with the Redbox. It had some discounts for online orders. Is that really what was just going on there, more so than, say, a macro?","And then second to follow that up, on the To-Go orders, it seems like there was a fairly meaningful promotional push in the back half of August to help highlight this during a busy period, get people focused on it. Do you think that helped to contribute to the success of the To-Go?","Eugene I. Lee","Yes, I'll take the first -- the second question first and say, absolutely. We were promoting it, so that definitely has increased the activity with To-Go. And as I said in the comments, we're now over 20%, but we don't feel like the activity is overdone. We think we're just introducing people to something that they want. The consumer feedback is fabulous on the To-Go. People are thrilled with the process. So again, I think the question is -- the answer to your question is, yes. We promoted it in that -- but we've gone from 10% growth to over 20% growth with that, and I believe this is going to stick. I believe To-Go is going to stick and it's going to continue to grow.","As far as volatility goes, a lot of the volatility really comes down to TRPs [ph] per week. And we know that when we back off our TRPs [ph] in Olive Garden, which we did the 2 weeks that were really negative in the month of July, especially around the Fourth of July week, we saw the sales decline. We know pretty much when we increase TRPs [ph], what we're going to get, and when we decrease TRPs [ph], what we're going to get. And so that was where the volatility really came from.","It was also the industry, the week of the Fourth of July, was down mid-single digits. And we were down a little bit worse than that, but the industry dropped significantly, while we were backing off TRPs [ph] and switching promotions. And so I'm really not that concerned about it. When I looked at the quarter, I believe that we had a lot more better weeks than we had bad weeks.","C. Bradford Richmond","I'll just add a little bit. If you look quarter-to-quarter for the industry, there wasn't any macro improvement in the industry. Clearly, there was from July to August, but in all those cases, Olive Garden outperformed the industry on those majors in terms of its improvements from quarter-to-quarter or months during the quarter. So we're pleased. I think there are some promotional activities that are helping enforcing it. But I think more fundamentally, what we see is the progress that Dave George and team are making there, are changing the base trends in the business.","Operator","That will come from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Olive Garden's traffic, it has performed better relative to the industry than it has in the recent past, which I definitely appreciate. But it did remain negative through the quarter. So what I'm really focused here is what you guys are assuming traffic will be for the balance of the fiscal year in order to achieve this earnings guidance. I know your same-store sales for Olive Garden need to be up about 0.5% to 2% for the balance of the year to hit the sales numbers. But what are the traffic assumptions within that, given what you're assuming for average check? And just a quick follow-up will be, under this new model without Red Lobster, what is the sensitivity with Olive Garden sales? What is 100 basis points of same-store sales worth to EPS going forward?","C. Bradford Richmond","We've talked about our general guidance for the year and some pricing in that. So what I would say is, we get to the year, on annual basis, we are looking at traffic that will decline at Olive Garden. But if we look at the back half of the year, the expectation is going to be roughly flat to maybe slightly positive. The second quarter will likely be negative, though we're pleased with how we came out of August, particularly not having the Never Ending Pasta Bowl. So on a broad basis there, it's improvement from the trend that's been on. It is clearly better than where we see the industry going from a traffic perspective as well.","And I didn't write it down -- what was your second question?","Unknown Executive","100 basis points.","C. Bradford Richmond","Oh, 100 basis points. Yes, let me -- so 100 basis of same-restaurant sales across Garden on an annual basis is still in that $0.11 to $0.14 range. If we look at quarters, remember, second quarter's still seasonally lower than the others, not to the magnitude it used to be on a post-Red Lobster basis though.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, and that number that you gave for EPS, that was on the whole chain? Or was that just on Olive Garden same-store sales?","C. Bradford Richmond","That's the whole business.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So are you able to boil it down just what the sensitivity on the Olive Garden comps would be?","C. Bradford Richmond","It would be roughly 55%, 60% of that, because -- just a broad measure. I don't have a specific number handy though.","Matthew V.

Same-restaurant sales increased 3.3%, and diluted net earnings per share were $1.34, an increase of 35.4% from last year\u2019s adjusted earnings.","We remain focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy to ensure we're delivering exceptional guest experiences, while strengthening our four competitive advantages. Olive Garden had a very strong quarter, which resulted in its 16th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 6.3%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 5.3%, and 1% growth from new restaurants. Same-restaurant guest counts grew 1.5%.","Olive Garden significantly outperformed the industry benchmarks across these metrics. This strong performance is a result of four years of consistently improving the value proposition at Olive Garden. We continue to strengthen value and convenience, which was reflected in our two promotional offers during the quarter; Create Your Own Lasagna and Buy One Take One. Both of these promotions, which offered our guests the opportunity to upgrade the premium entree selections, coupled with fewer incentives and an increase in preference in our Mediterranean dishes drove menu mix growth of 1.9%.","Additionally, the Olive Garden team continues to improve the off-premise experience. Off-premise sales grew 13% and represented 13% of total sales for the quarter. Our strong guest count growth as a result of the team's focus on simplification and flawless execution inside our restaurants, culinary innovation that appeals to our loyal guests, creating relevant and integrated marketing, and meeting our guests\u2019 desire for convenience. Our strategy is working and as reinforced by the fact that our key satisfaction measures including value remain at all-time highs.","LongHorn Steakhouse had another strong quarter, outperforming the industry benchmark and leading to its 22nd consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 6.4%, driven by 3.3% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 3.1%. Same-restaurant guest counts declined 0.3%, primarily driven by the fact that we ran a non-price pointed promotion during the quarter compared to a price-pointed promotion last year. That combined with increased add-ons and fewer incentives led to menu mix growth of 1.8%.","LongHorn's focus on their long-term strategy continues to enable profitable sales growth while they further invest in the guest experience. During the quarter, we implemented several initiatives to improve the quality of the guest experience, simplify our operations, and protect our unique culture. One of the ways LongHorn team continues to leverage its unique culture is through its annual Steak Master Series, an internal grilling competition and highly engaging training program.","This year's program began with more than 6,000 culinary team members competing and ended with Grill Master, Michelle Cerveny from our Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio restaurant being crowned the Steak Master Champion.","Finally, the LongHorn team continues to improve its off-premise experience as consumer demand grows. Overall, I am very pleased with the progress the team is making, executing their long-term strategy. Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen had total sales growth of 6.5%, driven by organic new restaurant growth and franchise restaurant acquisition growth of 10.5%, and offset by same restaurant sales decline of 4%. The original company restaurants were down 2.3% and the formerly franchise restaurants were down 6.7%.","We remain focused on rebuilding the operations foundation at Cheddar\u2019s and improving execution. Having the right leaders in the right place is fundamental to bringing our back-to-basics operating philosophy to life at Cheddar's. We spent a significant amount of time during the quarter evaluating and evolving the leadership team. As a result, we named John Wilkerson, President of Cheddar's eight weeks ago. A 25-year Darden veteran, John is a proven leader and the right person to lead the Cheddar's team. Most recently, he served as President of Bahama Breeze.","Additionally, Dave George our Chief Operating Officer will continue to dedicate a significant amount of his time working side by side with the Cheddar's team to improve the performance of the business. It\u2019s important for me to reiterate that we are committed to improving the foundational elements of operations, stabilizing our management teams, ensuring we\u2019re hiring and retaining great team members, and developing and executing consistent standards are critical to Cheddar's success.","We remain focused on long-term brand building strategies rather than short-term tactics. We acquired Cheddar's because it was the value leader in casual dining with tremendous growth potential, and that is as true today as it was 17 months ago. The power of this brand is reflected in its ability to maintain average weekly guest counts of approximately 6,000 per restaurant, even in the face of extraordinary change. There is a significant amount of work ahead, but with the focus and strong leadership we have today, I\u2019m confident Cheddar's is on the right track.","Each year during the first quarter, we hold our annual leadership conference which allows us to get in front of every general manager and managing partner across all 1,753 restaurants to discuss our plans for the year and generate excitement. These restaurant leaders hold the most influential role in our company and I value the opportunity to engage with them and listen to those closest to the action. I was pleased to see the alignment and focus on simplification and flawless execution driven home as a central theme at each conference.","In closing, we had a great first quarter, our strategy is working. We continue to grow our sales, increase market share, and improve margins, while making meaningful investments in our people and brands, all while being able to return capital to our shareholders. Our team members enable our success and our teams are the best in the business. So, I want to say thank you to our 180,000 team members who continue to create memorable dining experiences for our guests.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rick.","Rick Cardenas","Thank you, Gene, and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter with total sales growth of 6.5%, driven by 3.2% growth from the addition of 52 net new restaurants, and same restaurant sales growth of 3.3%. First quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.34, an increase of 35.4% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. We paid $93 million in dividends and repurchased $31 million in shares, returning a total of $124 million to our shareholders this quarter.","Before I get into the margin analysis, I want to mention that we adopted the new accounting standard on revenue recognition at the beginning of this fiscal year. One of the requirements of this new standard is to recognize revenue for sales of food and other products to franchisees with a corresponding increase in our cost of sales by the same amount. While the impact of this change is immaterial to Darden EBIT and EBIT margin overall, it does impact certain aspects of our results.","At the Darden level, it increases food and beverage as a percent of sales by approximately 20 basis points. This increase is subsequently offset in all other categories of the P&L, resulting in a minimal impact to Darden EBIT margin overall. In addition, this change reduces the segment profit margin of our other segment since this is the segment in which all of the impact is recognized.","Now, looking at the P&L. Food and beverage costs were favorable 40 basis points as pricing of 1.9%, and continued cost savings initiatives more than offset continued investments in food quality, and the negative impact related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Commodities inflation was essentially flat this quarter. Restaurant labor was unfavorable 70 basis points, despite continued productivity gains and sales leverage.","The increase was driven by hourly wage inflation of approximately 5%, previously announced workforce investments, and headwinds related to mark-to-market expenses for General Manager and managing partner equity awards. Restaurant expense was favorable 30 basis points as sales leverage more than offset inflation. And marketing expense was favorable by 20 basis points. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin of 18.2% was 20 basis points favorable to last year.","G&A expense was 30 basis points higher than last year, primarily driven by mark-to-market expenses related to the significant appreciation in the Darden share price this quarter. As a reminder, due to the way we hedged this expense, it is mostly offset in the tax line. Page 11 of the presentation we\u2019re broadcasting online and posted on our website, illustrates the impact mark-to-market had on our P&L in the first quarter.","Restaurant labor was higher by $2.9 million and G&A expense was higher by $7.6 million. In total, mark-to-market reduced EBIT by $10.5 million and EBIT margin by 50 basis points this quarter. Our hedge reduced income tax expense by $7.6 million, and the net impact of mark-to-market this quarter was $2.9 million reduction to earnings after tax. Due to the change in tax rate from tax reform, we were not fully hedged, resulting in approximately $0.02 of EPS unfavorability this quarter.","Looking at income tax expense, we had an abnormally low effective tax rate of 4% this quarter, due to two factors. First, tax benefits from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned reduced the tax rate by 4.3 percentage points. Second, higher than normal stock option exercises in the quarter, drove approximately $6 million of excess tax benefits, reducing the tax rate by approximately 3.4 percentage points. After adjusting for these factors, our normalized effective tax rate for the first quarter, would have been approximately 12%.","Turning to our segment performance. Olive Garden, LongHorn, and the Fine Dining segment all grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same restaurant sales and net new restaurants. Segment profit margin increased in each of these segments, even after the incremental work force investments, by leveraging the same restaurant sales growth and managing cost effectively.","Sales for our other business segment grew 7.1%, driven by net new restaurants and the purchase of 11 Cheddar's franchise restaurants in the second quarter of last year. Segment profit margin declined 120 basis points in this segment, due to margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales, primarily at Cheddar's, incremental workforce investments, and the adoption of revenue recognition, I previously mentioned.","Finally, in this morning's press release, we announced an increase to several components of our fiscal 2019 financial outlook. First, we increased both our total sales outlook to be between 5% and 5.5%, and same-restaurant sales outlook to be between 2% and 2.5%. Next, we updated our effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11% for the full fiscal year. We also increased our outlook for diluted average common shares outstanding for the year to approximately 126 million, related to higher than normal stock option exercises and increased share dilution, due to our stock price increase. All culminating in an increase in diluted net earnings per share to be between $5.52 and $5.65.","And with that, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Okay. The first question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. Your line is now open.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. Congratulations on a great start to the year. My question is on the Olive Garden comp and specifically on the mix components, looks very positive, and I know Gene you mentioned that people were upgrading to more premium offerings. So, I wanted to ask you about the sustainability of that trend, was that something you would attribute to the promotions you ran this quarter or do you think that that is something that can continue as you look forward?","Gene Lee","Yes. Good morning, David. It is our intention to moderate this positive mix as we move forward. We will continue to make investments into the menu. I really don't want to talk about what we're going to do there, but I would say contemplated in our guidance as we look forward is a moderation of that menu mix. I think this quarter was a confluence of a few different things as I said in my prepared remarks. I mean, we had a good promotion. We had some real high-value options that were a little bit more expensive that people could trade up to that we felt good about people trading up to inside those promotions.","We changed some merchandising on our menus, and we saw the increase in our Mediterranean platform. It drove some mix and our ability to pull back some incentives. So, it was a combination of a few things, and we would like to see that moderate a little bit as we go forward, and I think that\u2019s definitely contemplated in our outlook.","David Tarantino","Great. That\u2019s helpful and if I could squeeze one in on Cheddar's, I guess at a high-level Gene, I know you mentioned, you are focused on sort of fixing some of the longer-term operational and brand elements there, but I guess, how would you encourage us to think about when you would start to see progress on the topline? I know it could be a slow process, but just to the level set, when do you think you might start to turn the dial?","Gene Lee","I think Dave, I think that is a good question. And I think that we're starting to see progress on a daily basis. We measure the number of restaurants every day that are positive. That number is starting to increase. We\u2019re very pleased with the restaurants that have really strong leadership. We can see the retention numbers are stronger at the employee level, the execution numbers are higher. Those restaurants are growing. And so, as we think about it, this is really about trying to improve the fundamentals, and the framework that we\u2019re using to try to drive improvement in this business is based on the whole notion of strategy or process measurement, and I\u2019d say that we're pretty aligned. ","We have got the right strategy for this business. We spent the last 90 days really working on the organizational structure and to make sure we had leadership in the right place. I think the team now is going to focus on process, and they are going to focus on trying to simplify the operation and standardize it. With the acquisitions of the two franchise groups, there is a lot of differential on processes and procedures, and we need to standardize it and we think there\u2019s some opportunity inside the original Cheddar's to standardize, and then once we get that set, then we will figure out how we're going to measure it. ","I think one of the big opportunities in this business is to increase accountability. I think it\u2019s important to note that there\u2019s a lot of great people working in this brand, and once we get them aligned on what we want them to do and give them the tools to do it well, I think we're going to see some improvement. I'm not going to tell you that\u2019s third quarter, fourth quarter, or first quarter next year. What I\u2019m looking for every single day and I meet with Dave every day on this, and I get a report, are we getting better day-to-day, week-to-week, and I would tell you that we are seeing that happen right now.","David Tarantino","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Gregory Francfort","Gene, I had a question for you, kind of on the macro, it seems like casual\u2019s doing a lot better right now and everything we\u2019ve been hearing out of the quick service backdrop that it is a little bit softer. Are you seeing trade up from lower income consumers to middle income consumers or do you have any other diagnosis for maybe what might be driving that sort of broader based industry shift?","Gene Lee","Yes. We\u2019re not seeing anything that\u2019s conclusive that I can make that statement right now. When I think about what\u2019s going on with the consumer, you know obviously, consumer confidence is in an all-time high. People are feeling good. However, I don't think this is a tide where all the boats are rising. I think well-positioned brands that are executing are performing really well and I think you are continuing to see that as others announce their results. I do believe moving forward the biggest challenge in the industry is going to be the war for talent.","Brands that can hire, train, and retain front-line employees to bring their brands to life are going to win, and the dynamics inside the industry are changing dramatically, and I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused, and that\u2019s I think where the winners will be focused is, how they continue to invest in their team members, and how to ensure that you are properly staffed to execute against this increased demand, but back to your original question, I\u2019m not in a position to make a conclusive statement on that at this time.","Gregory Francfort","Maybe just going back to that, how much of the wage pressure right now in the industry do you think is coming from the labor reinvestments that are being made on tax reform, is that a big driver of the current, the 5% step-ups that you are seeing, and I guess the follow-on to that would be, once that sort of rolls off for a year, do you expect that level to come back in at all?","Gene Lee","No. I mean, I don't think the 5% really is being driven by the investment. I think the 5% really is being driven by the investment. I think the 5% is being driven by just a situation where as the employment environment gets better historically less employees come out of the restaurant space and into other opportunities. So, there is just a shrinking of a workflow here, and we\u2019re committed to staying, you know hiring the best possible people who bring our brands to life.","Our retention rates are actually improving, and I think part of that is because that we are willing to make the appropriate pay decision to keep our people. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve instructed our operations teams to do. I firmly believe that to win in this environment you are going to have to have great team members and we\u2019re going to do what we need to do to maintain and keep our team members, but I think the wait for us is going to be there for a while, and we\u2019re going to continue to find ways to offset it, but first and foremost we have to have the best team members on the closest to the action to bring our brands to life.","Gregory Francfort","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.","Will Slabaugh","Hi, thanks guys. I have an Olive Garden question to start, and then maybe a broader topic to hit on. So, this is your best Olive Garden comp since 2008 from what we can find, and I realize Gene you weren\u2019t CEO at Darden then, but can you talk about what you are seeing in guest behavior from your perspective now versus what you saw back in the industry? And to what degree is there any euphoria in the amount of consumer versus simply healthy consumer and a strong better positioned Olive Garden that\u2019s just capable of putting up these one and two-year comp numbers?","Gene Lee","Yes. I think overall it\u2019s a healthy consumer, and I think the work that we have been doing for the last four years since Dave took over Olive Garden and our focus on the core consumer and continuing to put value back into the menu has just all kind of come together, and we\u2019re able to put up a great quarter, and I think what I\u2019m most excited about is that we\u2019re continuing to find new ways to improve the value proposition for the Olive Garden consumer, and do it in a way that is engaging and relevant, and the brand continues to really be well-received by many different cohorts, consumer cohorts out there, especially millennials. This is a brand that\u2019s very social that performs very well in social media.","So, I think this is just a culmination of a strong consumer and four years of really focused work on trying to improve our value proposition to our core guests. And I think staying true to who we are is probably the most important thing that we\u2019re doing.","Will Slabaugh","Got it. And if I could follow-up on the comments you made on Cheddar's earlier, it\u2019s good to hear you're seeing some improvements at the brand as you mentioned. My question is around eventual acceleration in unit growth, what are you looking for from a metric standpoint may be outside of same-store sales or whether it be team feedback or whatnot before you would be ready to ratchet up to growth of that brand?","Gene Lee","I want to see the retention numbers that management and [indiscernible] level getting much closer to Darden norms. You know, what I have been doing this long enough to know that we can't grow rapidly without strong management retention and having an employee proposition that the employees stay with us. That\u2019s the key to driving sustainable growth.","Will Slabaugh","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","John Glass","Thanks very much. Just on your comments on the labor inflation this quarter kicking up, I think earlier in the year or the beginning of the year you talked about a little bit less labor inflation is that now your base case that remains at 5% in your new guidance or do you think this quarter was maybe an anomaly turn over at Cheddar's or whatever else that may have driven it specifically?","Gene Lee","Hi, John. Yes, when we guided earlier in the year we said that our total labor would be 3.5% to 4.5%, but wage inflation would be approximately 5%, and that hasn't changed. So, this is really right on where we guided in the beginning of the year.","John Glass","Okay. And then if you could just, what was the impact to overall restaurant margin from Cheddar's specifically. In other words, how could we think about where restaurant margin could go if Cheddar's was back on its game and comps were positive again?","Gene Lee","John, we are not willing to talk about the actual margin for the brand itself. We did talk about the overall margin for the other segment, but they did have negative same-restaurant sales growth, so you would anticipate a little bit of a decline in margin at Cheddar's for this quarter.","John Glass","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Nicole Miller ","Thank you, good morning. So, it\u2019s clear you have an advantage in value, could you talk about the benefits of the advantages still on the current environment? And I'm thinking about some of the comments you have made about not being, but we\u2019re on labor and maybe also as it relates to on premise specifically delivery? Thanks.","Gene Lee","I'm sorry. You were breaking up a little bit Nicole, could you just repeat your question?","Nicole Miller ","I'm sorry Gene. I wanted to ask about the advantage of scale. So, you talk a lot about the advantage of value, but I want to ask about the advantage of scale in the current environment as it relates to things like marketing and labor, off-promise and delivery?","Gene Lee","Scale is one of our four competitive advantages and I think that we continue to focus on becoming more efficient with everything that\u2019s a non-consumer facing that allows us to make investments into the consumer facing side of the business. I also think one of the big advantages of scale is, the perspective we have on the industry and we can see how consumers behave all the way from Cheddar's to Capital Grille. And I think we can make investments that others can't make, and I think we have some better insight and where to make those investments.","So, scale is an important part of what we\u2019re doing. I think it\u2019s a very important part of the employment proposition. We talked a lot about scale and what it does for the consumer proposition, but scale provides our employees a lot of value. And we will continue to find new and innovative ways with our scale to improve the employment proposition. We are making sure that we're spending as much time talking about the employment proposition as we are talking about the consumer proposition.","And I think that\u2019s different than maybe where we were 3, 4 years ago in a different environment, and so I really want to go back to a statement I made earlier. The brand's that can hire and attract and retain the best people are going to win \u2013 are going to accelerate their success in this environment.","Nicole Miller ","And given the strength of Capital Grille and Eddie V's could you talk about the Fine Dining trends and is check or traffic really the driver behind that performance? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Yes. Fine Dining continues to perform fairly well. You\u2019ve got both a little bit of traffic growth and some check growth in there. We always have trouble reading our upscale brands on check in traffic because the consumer, you know our traffic numbers are generated from entree counts and both businesses do a lot of bar business and generate a lot of traffic that\u2019s not always related back to an entree count, but those businesses feel healthy, there is no geographical differences. We\u2019re excited about some opportunity in capital growth and increase some capacity in restaurants that are at full capacity right now and so we\u2019re really excited about the performance of our upscale businesses, and they continue to do really well. We think they\u2019re really well-positioned and we\u2019re looking forward to being able to grow Eddie V\u2019s a little bit quicker in the future as that base gets bigger.","Nicole Miller ","Thank you. And congrats on a great quarter.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning. Last year I think you said, there was a hurricane drag of 30 basis points in fiscal 1Q and 60 basis points in the second quarter, how much hurricane noise do you think there was this quarter, this fiscal 1Q this year, net of last year and knowing about last year's drag in performance this year, how much do you anticipate for fiscal 2Q?","Gene Lee","Yes, last year we did say 30 basis points in Q1. I think what we said in Q2 was the impact of the hurricane net of any bounce back was pretty much negligible in Q2. It might have been an initial shock and the bounce back caught up. So, this year we basically have a hurricane that happened in the earlier part of our quarter, but we should anticipate some bounce back over time. All of that had contemplated in our guidance. So, the 2% to 2.5% same-restaurant sales includes the impact of the hurricane for the quarter.","David Palmer","Okay. And for Olive Garden, that wider gap to the industry, how much of that was Buy One Take One being more effective and perhaps running a little bit longer in the quarter versus what you see as other drivers in that brand? Thanks.","Gene Lee ","Yes. David, again I go back to Buy One Take One ran, I don't know if they ran any more weeks during the quarter because I think it bridges first and second quarter. I think the big thing is that there may have been some pent-up demand because we didn\u2019t run it in the fourth quarter last year, and so we had one extra week in the quarter for Buy One Take One. I think it was the excess demand and I would caution anybody to point to one thing that drove the overall Olive Garden acceleration in comps and improved gap. I want to keep coming back to. This is confidence of a lot of hard work, a little bit extra increase in mix, strong promotions with good add-ons, but overall, I wouldn't want to point to just promotional impact.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. One just on the restaurant margin. I mean it seems like it was relatively flat this quarter, despite the North of 3% comp, and obviously a very strong comp at Olive Garden, just wondering how you think about that going forward? What perhaps is implied in your guidance, and what type of comp and\/or price might you need to actually see expanding margins or should we just assume that with labor of mid-single digits flattish type margin would be considered success?","Gene Lee","Hi Jeff. Just to remember our margin did include 50 basis points of unfavorability from mark-to-market this quarter, which was significant. Even with that, we had 20 basis points of margin improvement at the restaurant level this quarter. We did anticipate the wage rate that we had in our initial guide, and we still anticipate our labor \u2013 I'm sorry, our wage inflation to be about 5%. And also, this year in the first quarter, we had workforce investments that we didn\u2019t have last year. ","Now those were previously announced. So, we're really happy with where our restaurant level margin came in, and I\u2019ll take you back to our long-term framework. Our long-term framework is 10 basis points to 30 basis points of EBIT margin expansion, and we still anticipate to be somewhere in that framework this year.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Understood. And then just thinking about from a modelling perspective, 53rd week is that something we should be anticipating in fiscal 2020 and factoring into our models at this point?","Gene Lee","Yes. I believe the 53rd week is fiscal 2020.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. I just had two questions. One on, I know you said on prior calls you were looking at testing delivery. I think we\u2019ve seen you test a couple of stores and brands on both Uber and Grubhub, just curious if you can give us some updates on that what you\u2019ve seen in early indications such as greater off-premise sales et cetera. And then also Gene I had a question with respect to value, I guess OG rewards has been out there for a little while, can you talk about that? Is that something that in Casual Dining could be something that could be of a next leg of value, and are you seeing that grow at an accelerated pace faster than the rest of the sales?","Gene Lee","Let\u2019s start with third-party. We continue to test with the third-party delivery services of scale. We\u2019re monitoring, we\u2019re learning as this business starts to mature, but for us there is significant hurdles that we still have to work through. We\u2019re not sure that it enhances our brands. We\u2019re concerned about how it\u2019s executed. We\u2019re concerned if they can create incremental growth at scale. We\u2019re not happy with the economics. We still have the issue of the data. And lastly, we have to get our arms around how we protect the profitability of our large and growing current off-business premise, which would be difficult to deal with. ","So, for right now, we don't anticipate entering into a third-party delivery space in a meaningful way. We\u2019ll continue to analyze and look at our option\u2019s going forward. But we have a very large off-premise business today that\u2019s growing double-digits that the consumer rates us extremely high on, and we're going to continue to make sure that experiences is the best it can be, and we\u2019ll look at third-party. We just don't see this as something that we want to get involved in today with the current way it\u2019s being executed.","On OG rewards, OG rewards is a very small test in a multi-brand, in a market with all of our brands. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at. At this point, it\u2019s a test, and I don't really want to talk too much further about the test and its results. And if and when this becomes something that is worthy of further discussion and roll-out we\u2019ll talk about it at that time.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Greg Badishkanian of Citi. Your line is now open.","Fred Wightman","Hi guys. It is actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. I think a few weeks ago it came out that there was a cyberattack at Cheddar's, just wondering if there were any reserves for that that showed up in the quarter?","Rick Cardenas","Hi, Greg. First of all, I just want to make sure that we understand. We take this privacy and security of our guests\u2019 personal information very, very seriously and regret to think that it occurred. Important to note that this incident occurred on a Cheddar's former POS system that was permanently disabled in April, and we completed the implementation of our proprietary POS system and Darden\u2019s systems and networks were not impacted. I will say that we did reserve what we believe will be the cost in the first quarter and that is included in our G&A expense.","Fred Wightman","Okay. And could you quantify that specific price? Or do you want to leave it a little bit more vague?","Rick Cardenas","I will just leave it, as it is in our G&A expenses for the quarter.","Fred Wightman","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Chris O\u2019Cull of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi good morning guys. This is actually Mitch [ph] on for Chris. Just on Cheddar's in a follow-up on an earlier question on its unit growth, could you just discuss your strategy to grow that brands unit base once you iron out all the integration work? Do you expect to materially accelerate the pace?","Gene Lee","You know, I think once we get the fundamentals in place and we\u2019ve got the employment situation, what I would call in-line with our other business is we will start to grow it. We will ramp it up from where it is at today. We're going to use a backfill strategy and we will get, we really don't know how fast we can go. We\u2019ve got to learn more about the growth potential of the business and we will grow as fast as our human resources allow us to grow. We think that getting up towards that 7% to 10% unit-growth this kind of a barrier, and we will give you more guidance as we get to that point in the cycle.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Neil Vasquez in behalf of Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Neil Vasquez","Thank you. I have a question on the 2019 forecast, and then a follow-up in LongHorn. So, on the forecast, is it to assume that a top line trend you saw in first Q have persisted? Or was it just meaningful enough that even if the rest of the year reverse your initial forecast, you can still meet updated guidance?","Rick Cardenas","We\u2019re not going to talk about where we are for the quarter to date. I will just say that all of the information we know as of today is included in our forecast. And as you remember \u2013 as you recall Gene said in his remarks, the mix growth that we had in the first quarter, we\u2019re going to have some things to help moderate that so that we can continue to improve our value proposition and again that\u2019s why that\u2019s in our guidance.","And I do want to make a clarification on Jeff Bernstein's question on labor or on the restaurant expense. Our restaurant margin unfavourability from mark-to-market and workforce was 40 basis points. So, with the 40-basis point reduction, we still had a really good restaurant labor. I just want to make sure that I clarify that.","Neil Vasquez","Thank you. And on LongHorn, if you could give a little bit more clarity on the LongHorn components because same-store traffic was more negative than we would have expected given the use of the compressions and we were wondering at what point do you prefer towards more of a traffic driven strategy?","Gene Lee","Yes. As I said in my prepared remarks, the primary drive driver of the slight decrease in guest traffic was driven by not running a price point or promotion, and we also have less incentives out there. So, our overall profitability improved significantly throughout the quarter. So, I think our strategy is working where we continue to remove or eliminate a discounted consumer that\u2019s taking out space on our busy night, and I\u2019m thrilled with the components of the LongHorn business and to be able to get those incentives out and pull back on the price point of promotion. So, I know it was a great quarter for LongHorn.","Neil Vasquez","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open.","Jake Bartlett","Great. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is on the 2019 EPS guidance, if I could just look at what you \u2013 you increased the same-store sales guidance, but the EPS guidance isn't up as much as I would have thought. I believe some of the difference is going to be the mark-to-market, maybe the stock options, but if you could just clarify what the moving pieces are to mute the EPS guidance kind of growing with the same-store sales?","Rick Cardenas","Yes, Jake. Basically, if you think about the guidance that we have for the year for EPS growth of [5.52 to 5.65] it is impacted by a couple of things. One is, we are increasing our same restaurant sales as you mentioned, but we have higher share count than we had in our original guidance of 1 million shares roughly and that actually impacts us by about $0.04 unfavorable. And we had such a great tax rate in the first quarter at 4%, while our annual guide tax rate is going to go down by 100 basis points of still an increase in tax rate from this first quarter.","Jake Bartlett","Got it. So, when we think about the mark-to-market in the first quarter for the restaurant level margin, is that affect going to flow through for the rest of the year and the same, I guess goes for stock comp kind of going up pretty significantly, is that also a meaningful headwind for \u2013 on G&A?","Rick Cardenas","Jake, the mark-to-market all depends on what happens with the stock price and what happens with the market price of just basically the general market. So, we aren't really necessarily forecasting what\u2019s going to happen to our stock price. We adjust and in regards to our option exercise, we just had a lot of options exercise in the first quarter, much more than we typically do. And the majority of those were exercised by retirees. Not necessarily be built here. And so, as we look at the option exercise for the rest of the year, we would anticipate it to be a more normal rate than it was in the first quarter.","Jake Bartlett","Got it. And then Gene just a question about the environment. We\u2019re seeing restaurant sales if you look at the kind of the government retail numbers, up 10% year-over-year in July and August, it seems like that would imply some of the smaller change or some of the independence are gaining share. Are you seeing that and how do you, kind of, how does that jive with this need to retain talent and attract talent? I would think that the larger chains have a better ability to do that, so I am just trying to understand when the dynamic of whose gaining share and this kind of very strong demand environment, and then also why there might be?","Gene Lee","Yes. Actually, no evidence that says independence or small change are gaining share. I mean our data on that is a little lagging, but I believe that when I look at the data and the industry, again the well-positioned bigger players are continuing to really outperform, and I think that\u2019s going to continue to be true as we move forward. Again, I haven't seen anything that says that where the large players are losing share. I just think that, when we think about employment, I think it is really hard for lower volume businesses to attract great team members because there is just not enough income to share at the service level and freedom in the business model to pay what you need to pay to attract really good talent in the back of the house. And so, I think our brands have a distinct advantage there, where our business model enables us to create an employment proposition that works for our team members.","Jake Bartlett","Great. Thank you, very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","John Ivankoe","Hi, thank you. I think you said that, off-premise was 13% of sales and was growing around 13%. So, how much of that growth is incremental to the business? You know how much can off-premise grow as a percentage of sales without delivery? And Gene, I know you\u2019re being dismissive [ph], at least in the near-term around some of the delivery services, but how far are you thinking about may be leveraging some of Olive Garden particular scale and doing some in-house delivery yourself, especially for some of the smaller more individual size or family size deliveries.","Gene Lee ","Yes. And as you know, we do delivery for catering for minimum $100 order, 24 hours in advance is a very, very good business for us with a great check average and incredible satisfaction scores. We\u2019ll continue to look at whether $100 is the right place to be on that. Right now, we have no interest in delivering a $10 meal to \u2013 an individual meal to an individual household. That\u2019s just not a business that we think we want to be involved in right now. As far as where do we think to go and off-promise can go to, and there\u2019s a lot to do with what the consumer or what the consumer demand is for.","We will continue to comp with innovative product offerings. We\u2019ll make the process have less friction in it through technology. We think we\u2019re doing an exceptional job in Olive Garden with packaging, and process are on time and correct orders continues to improve. So, we're feeling really good about where we are at. And my goal, our goal, and the team's goal is to create a compelling offer to that consumers, so they are still willing to come pick it up at our restaurant, and our growth in this business is reinforcing that we are doing a good job with it. And so that\u2019s where I want to be. And I have said publicly, if the consumer goes, wants to continue to go there, we could see Olive Garden get to 20% off-premise sales over time.","John Ivankoe","And that is largely without delivery. So that\u2019s still with the $100 minimum delivery that you are current at?","Gene Lee","Yes. And as I said John in my \u2013 I don't anticipate entering into a third-party delivery system agreement in a meaningful way. There are things that I really don't like about that business. ","John Ivankoe","Understood. And of that 13-point growth in this quarter, how much incremental business do you think that growth is giving you?","Gene Lee","Well it was about 30% of our total growth for same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden this quarter. So, remember we still grew in restaurants significantly to determine what exactly how much is incrementality. It is a difficult proposition, but it was only 30% of our same restaurant sales growth.","John Ivankoe","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO. Your line is now open.","Andrew Strelzik","Hi, good morning. I have two questions. The first one, I\u2019m wondering about the relative margin progression at Olive Garden versus LongHorn with Olive Garden, obviously out comping LongHorn by a reasonable degree, they both expanded margins at the same rates. So, I guess I\u2019m wondering is there anything, kind of with respect to the models or maybe the mark-to-market that was disproportionate or even if there was any investments or anything like that that limited or drove the convergence of the margin progression this quarter?","Gene Lee","Yes, Andrew. The easy answer is, Olive Garden had higher food inflation than LongHorn did. LongHorn\u2019s inflation was lower than Olive Garden. So, food cost favorability at LongHorn was greater than Olive Garden\u2019s.","Andrew Strelzik","Okay. That makes sense. And then my other question, you know maybe Cheddar's is in exactly where you want it to be right now, but you have made a lot of progress on the integration, and I saw yesterday in the press release about the change to the board, comments outing the M&A expertise there, you know kind of what are the signposts you're looking for before you\u2019re ready to make another deal or maybe if you could comment on the M&A environment right now it would be great too?","Gene Lee","Yes. We\u2019re focused right now on stabilizing and really getting off the Cheddar's business where we are not interested in doing anything else at this point in time. I\u2019m not sure, I'm not going to comment on the M&A environment, I'm not really involved in it. So, I don't really know. I don't have an opinion of it. Our focus is, we made an investment to get to bring Cheddar's into our portfolio, to take advantage of our platform.","I actually believe in my heart that the operational challenges we\u2019ve had to face are making us really go back to the foundation of this business, and get it right. And if we didn't face these challenges and things may have been a little bit better, we may have gotten to the growth aspect a little quicker and not been able to sustain that into the future because there were real cracks in the foundation and we\u2019ve uncovered those cracks and now we will fix them to build a sustainable business. ","So, that\u2019s what \u2013 I'm really excited about that, but our focus right now is, let\u2019s get Cheddar's moving in the right direction. When that\u2019s going in the right direction, we\u2019ll pull back. We\u2019ll look at our opportunities from an M&A standpoint, and we\u2019ll decide what we want to do.","Andrew Strelzik","Great. Thank you, very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Karen Holthouse","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Another question on guidance for the year. It does embed a little bit of a deceleration in comps as we move through the year. I know you mentioned the sort of intentional play to try and pull back on check mix or the check contribution at Olive Garden, is there anything else we should have on our radar, either in terms of compares or you know some conservatism around weather and winter or anything that would also be kind of impacting the cadence through the year on guidance?","Rick Cardenas","Yes, Karen a couple of things. One, we did have the hurricane this quarter that offset last quarter's hurricane impact from last year of 30 basis points. Gene did mention the check moderation that you are trying to go forward with. And then we do have a little bit of a tough [ph] comparing the back half of the year. But our guidance is still in the higher end of our long-term framework. It\u2019s 2% to 2.5%, including Cheddar's, the drag on Cheddar's that we\u2019ve had so far. So, we feel really confident in the guide that we have and feel like it\u2019s actually an appropriate number.","Karen Holthouse","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Stephen Anderson of Maxim Group. Your line is now open.","Stephen Anderson","Yes. Good morning. And I wanted to follow-up with the [prior questions asked about] food cast at both Olive Garden and LongHorn. Last [indiscernible] you talked about 2% at food cost inflation, looking at some of the areas actually, poultry of well below year ago levels, as corn prices down, maybe a little bit lift in beef, but overall are you still looking at any change to your 2% overall inflation outlook?","Rick Cardenas","No. We\u2019re not seeing any change to our overall 2% inflation, but remember that our outlook was 0% to 1% for food and beverage cost.","Stephen Anderson","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Right now, speakers, we do not have any questions in queue. You may now proceed.","Gene Lee","That concludes our call. Thank you for participating and I want to remind you that we plan to release second quarter results on Tuesday, December 18 before the market opens with a conference call to follow.

As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections.

A reconciliation of these measurements is in our earnings release. In addition, we are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call. This presentation will be posted under the Investors tab on our Web site at the conclusion of the call. We plan to release fiscal 2016 second quarter earnings on Friday, December 18 before the market opens, followed by a conference call.","This morning, following prepared remarks from Gene and Jeff, we will take your questions.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. We are pleased with the progress we made during the first quarter, as we significantly outperformed the industry in terms of same restaurant sales and traffic. Total sales grew 5.7% for the quarter, which was driven by strong same restaurant sales growth at 3.4% and positive same restaurant sales at each of our brands, plus the addition of 30 net new restaurants. Earnings per share, on an adjusted basis, increased approximately 113% to $0.68 and first quarter adjusted EBIT margins once again show strong improvement. Olive Garden continues to build on a positive business momentum generated in fiscal 2015, with its fourth consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth.","During the quarter, guest counts turned positive and outperformed the industry by more than 200 basis points. As we discussed previously, a key element of Olive Garden's culinary strategy is to create menu items that leverage core brand equities. During the quarter, we saw two examples of this strategy.","First, the Create Your Own Tour of Italy promotion inspired by one of our most popular core menu items, allowed guests to create their own entr\u00e9e by choosing from many of their favorite dishes. Additionally, this full price and customized offer, which started in July, outperformed the deep discounted promotion during the same period last year.","Second, we introduced the Create Your Own Lunch combination menu platform, which features the choice of unlimited soup or salad, plus the choice of either a mini pasta bowl, a flat bread, or one of our highly anticipated and extremely well received breadstick sandwiches. This platform's strength in Olive Garden's competitive advantage by adding more variety and giving guests the ability to customize their order for great value.","The new lunch menu was supported by a successful integrated marketing campaign, which we call breadstick nation. That featured Olive Garden food trucks that travel across the country, making 80 stops in 20 different markets to share more than 50,000 samples of breadstick sandwiches. The campaign clearly resonated with our guests, as it generated more than 820 million impressions across traditional and social media. This new platform, coupled with the breadstick nation campaign, led to a three point improvement in weekday lunch traffic during the quarter. It was the most successful new lunch platform, since the introduction of the original soup, salad and breadsticks, and guest preference for the Create Your Own Lunch combination, was higher than the lunch option of soup, salad and breadsticks during the quarter.","Additionally, OG To Go continues to be a focus, as we strive to meet our guest's growing need for convenience. This quarter, OG To Go grew 18% and we have seen a two year growth rate of over 30% and we continue to be excited about the opportunities that growth in takeout represents for our business.","We also continued the roll out of our table-top tablets. The tablets are now on more than half of our restaurants, with 80% of the tables choosing to interact with the devices in those restaurants. We continue to see the same benefits, as we saw during the tests, higher add-on sales, faster dining times, and overall higher guest satisfaction scores. We are pleased with the progress of the rollout, and we expect to complete it by the end of the second quarter.","And on a final note on Olive Garden, we have now refreshed 19 restaurants, and we remain pleased with their continued performance. As we have shared previously, we are taking the time to develop individualized plans for each restaurant based on a number of factors, to ensure optimal investment levels going forward. We plan to refresh approximately 25 additional locations this fiscal year.","Now let's look at LongHorn Steakhouse; LongHorn continues to be well positioned in the market, and delivered strong top line growth driven by positive same restaurant sales of 4.4%, marking the 10th consecutive quarter that we have outperformed the industry. Two key factors have contributed to that performance include, focusing on culinary innovation that leverages our steak expertise, and continuing to evolve our marketing strategy, with an increased emphasis on one-to-one engagement.","During the quarter, we welcomed Todd Burrowes back to LongHorn as President. Todd's strong operations focus, passion and deep understanding of the brand will further strengthen LongHorn's performance. Operational execution has always been a hallmark of LongHorn's success. I believe we have the opportunity to take our in-restaurant execution to an even higher level under Todd's leadership.","Looking at our specialty restaurants, all five brands, Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, and Eddie Vs had positive same restaurant sales during the quarter, and we are pleased with their continued progress. Each brand is well positioned in its competitive set, and has the opportunity to increase their market share through same restaurant sales growth and the addition of new restaurants.","Now I want to provide an update on our comprehensive real estate plan that we announced in June. Since that time, we have made refinements to our plan. We now intend to separate 488 restaurant real estate properties through the sale leaseback of 64 restaurant properties, and a REIT spend that will include 424 restaurant properties to create an independent company called Four Corners Property Trust, which was discussed in its Form 10 filing last month.","Using proceeds from the sale leasebacks, debt financing from Four Corners and Darden's balance sheet cash, we will retire approximately $1 billion of debt, and pay approximately $100 million of debt repayment costs, largely representing the acceleration of interest payable through 2017. The rating agencies have conveyed that they anticipate these transactions will be credit neutral to positive for Darden. These transactions are bond covenant compliant, and bondholder consent is not required.","The approximate annualized financial impact of these restaurant real estate transactions to Darden will include, incremental cash rent of $108 million and GAAP rent expense of $116 million; a reduction in depreciation of $51 million and a reduction in interest expense of $45 million, resulting in a run rate reduction to pre-tax earnings of $20 million.","Of course, in the spin-off, Darden shareholders will receive equity in Four Corners, the new owner of the real estate. We would expect the equivalent per share dividend amount of Darden and Four Corners to be at least equal to the current Darden dividend.","Since announcing the appointment of Bill Lenehan as CEO last month, to process, to buildup a management team and board is fully underway. We continue to work towards the goal of completing the Four Corner spin by the end of the calendar year. And one final note on our real estate plan, we continue to pursue a sale leaseback of our restaurant support center.","With that, I will turn it over to Jeff, for a financial update and outlook on fiscal 2016. But before I do that, let me say, how excited we are to have Jeff as our new CFO. In the short time he has been here, he has made a meaningful contribution and has proven to be a valuable addition to our executive leadership team. Jeff?","Jeff Davis","Thank you, Gene, and good morning everyone. I am excited to be a part of this outstanding organization. I look forward to the opportunity to work with many of you in the future. As Gene mentioned, we reported strong same restaurant sales of 3.4%, and as you saw on the release, there was monthly variability and sales performance.","We report same restaurant sales on a fiscal calendar basis, and due to our 53rd week last year, its not on a comparable calendar basis. In addition to normal holiday shifts, this may create month-to-month variability in our reported results.","However, during the first quarter, the monthly variability was completely offset by quarter end, and as a reminder, the upcoming thanksgiving holiday will be reported in our fiscal second quarter versus fiscal third quarter last year.","Reviewing our earnings performance this quarter, adjusted EPS from continuing operations, more than doubled as adjusted EBIT margins expanded 330 basis points versus the prior year. This was partially driven by leveraging positive same restaurant sales. Other significant drivers on margin expansion were 170 basis points improvement in food and beverage expense, and 100 basis point improvement in restaurant expense.","More specifically, we had significant year-over-year favorability in dairy costs at Olive Garden. We had six fewer weeks of deep discounted promotions at Olive Garden versus last year. We continued progress towards previously disclosed cost reduction initiatives. A 30 basis point improvement in workers compensation and public liability expense related to historical claims, and more efficient restaurant support, resulting in 30 basis point improvement in G&A versus last year.","Moving below operating income, interest expense was considerably lower this year, as we lapped the $1 billion extinguishment of debt last year. Our effective tax rate was 130 basis points higher than last year. We expect the tax rate for the full year to be within 21% to 24% range we disclosed in June.","From a balance sheet perspective, we received approximately $130 in proceeds related to the sale and leaseback of 33 restaurant properties, which are included in the 64 Gene mentioned earlier. These proceeds largely drove the increase in our cash balance for the quarter.","Turning to segment performance, Olive Garden's segment profit margin of 20.3% grew by 410 basis points from leveraging their positive same restaurant sales, dairy cost favorability, fewer weeks of deep discounted promotions versus last year, and continued progress on cost reduction initiatives.","LongHorn's segment profit margin remained flat at 14.9%, and a significant beef cost inflation offset sales leverage and cost reductions. Fine dining expanded segment profit margins by 100 basis points, as leverage from sales growth more than offset beef cost inflation. And finally in other business, Seasons 52 and Yard House significantly improved their profitability, resulting into 360 basis point improvement and segment profit margin.","While we continue to expect margin expansion in the second half of the year, we anticipate that it will significantly moderate versus first half performance, as we lap margin improvement initiatives that begin in the third quarter of last year.","Given the company's strong first quarter performance and our expectation for the remainder of the yea, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2016 full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to range between $3.15 and $3.30 versus $3.05 and $3.20, previously announced in June.","Our same restaurant sales expectation for the full year remains unchanged at 2% to 2.5%. We also remain on-track to deliver 18 to 22 new restaurants, with LongHorn and Yard House accounting for the majority of the openings.","These expectations do not include the impact of any fiscal 2016 real estate transactions and related capital structure activities. However, as we approach the completion of the various real estate transactions, we will provide more details on the specific timing and impacts to our financial performance.","And now I will turn it back over to Gene for some closing remarks.","Gene Lee","Thank you, Jeff. I want to close by reiterating that our intense focus on improving our food, service and our atmosphere continues to drive our positive business momentum, enabling us to capture market share, as our guest reward us by choosing our brands more frequently. We are excited about our progress, but we know we have a lot of work to do.","Our restaurant teams and our support center staff at our restaurant support center are focused on the right priorities and the progress we are making is a direct result of their hardwork and commitment to creating memorable guest experiences.","So thank you to our 150,000 team members who bring our business to life everyday, and now we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Joseph Buckley with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Joseph Buckley","On the monthly data, it looked like the check increase moderated both at Olive Garden and LongHorn. Is it coincidental that happened to both brands, or is there some effort to make that happen?","Gene Lee","Joe, it's Gene. I think its more coincidental and I think it has more to do with our fiscal calendar not matching up to what I would call, the operating calendar. As we ship, we have got some -- there is some noise in the data.","Joseph Buckley","Okay. And then, secondly, what are the kind of key hurdles or milestones to getting the REIT spinoff done. These reports about the IRS being [indiscernible] to pre-approve transactions? I don't know if that is significant or not, in the scheme of things. Could you talk about that?","Bill White","Yeah Joe, its Bill White. What we would tell you, is that the latest public statements that the Services made really -- they have talked about a no real position applying to PLR requests filed on or after September 14th. And so that really, in our minds, does not impact our plans. We are working towards spending the entity by the end of the calendar year.","Joseph Buckley","Okay. Maybe one last one, just on the rent expense line, we realized some nice improvement. Can you talk about the cost buckets in that line with the savings and the efficiencies are being realized?","Gene Lee","Joe, do you mean restaurant expenses?","Joseph Buckley","Yeah. Did I not say that, that's what I meant to say?","Gene Lee","Restaurant expenses, well first of all, we are getting some leverage from our sales growth. As Jeff mentioned in his comments, we had some favorability and historical claims on workers comp. We are also continuing to manage the non-consumer facing costs very aggressively and we continue through the work of PCG to bid a lot of work, and we are using our scale, as we talked about in the past, to bring down these costs. One of the big areas Joe is contract services.","Joseph Buckley","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.","Matt DiFrisco","Thank you. Can you just talk a little bit more I guess, on the August comp trend and what just sort of -- give I guess, investors a little comfort, that you don't seem too concerned about the volatility within the quarter. You mentioned something about some moving around weeks. I am just curious if you could sort of tell us what might be driving sort of that perception of slowdown on the -- both traffic and the overall comp at a [indiscernible] brands? And then also, just curious I guess -- just as a follow-up to Joe's question, has there been a change in your view then with the IRS or no, there has not been a change since you began to reprocess and there is nothing -- you don't think you will meet resistance is what we should read through? Thanks.","Gene Lee","Yeah. Matt, as far as August goes -- again, this goes back to our fiscal calendar versus, what I would call the operating calendar comparison. The last week of August was a really bad fiscal comparison, which hurt the overall month, and as we look at it, we don't see a deceleration as we look at, what we would call, comparable comps, or true comps is what Malcolm refers to them. So we believe that the business is -- on an operating basis, didn't have as much variability as it shows -- as we report through the fiscal calendar.","As far as the question on the REIT, we are really confident that our proposed transaction will satisfy all the requirements of applicable law, and we plan on moving forward and having this deal done by the end of the calendar year.","Matt DiFrisco","Okay. I guess, just to read through for layman's terms; the later timing of Labor Day, I guess, is that something to say, might have caused the imbalance on fiscal versus actual -- of how you look at it on business quarters? And so, what might have been lost in August? You are feeling good enough that that's evenly balanced and what might have been hurting August, just like July and June, some shift [ph] maybe we are going to see a lift in September?","Gene Lee","Well I am not going to comment on the sales in September at this point in time. But it was the combination of the Labor Day pushback. You have heard some retailers talk about that, and also comparing, the fiscal calendar back. We are actually comparing it against the last week of our fiscal calendar, was comparing against a week that wasn't really in the center of August last year, and not towards the end of August. So those combinations really created for a tough fiscal comparison in the last week of August.","Matt DiFrisco","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens Inc.","Will Slabaugh","Thanks guys. I had a question around the Olive Garden comps, and you mentioned, one of the reasons that both of the margins in the comps improved, saw some really good uptick on the promotions and then, a little bit less of a deep discounting. So wanted to center around the deep discounting comment that you made. Can you put any numbers around, what the discounting looks like last year, and what that looks like now, and sort of what you want the discounting piece of the business to look like going forward?","Gene Lee","Yeah, good question. Last year, in July, we ran three course, which is heavily discounted promotion, it was at $12.99. This year, our promotion was Build Your Own Tour, starting at $12.99 with add ons, so it had more of an effective price range in the $15 to $16 price point. And so that worked really -- really helped us, as far as our overall cost management, it helped our labor costs, it helped our costs, so on and so forth.","We are going to -- and we look out into the future. We are going to continue to look for ways to modify the promotional calendar. At the end of August and right now, we are running buy one take one against buy one take one. We are going to run never ending pasta bowl against never ending pasta bowl. So there are times of the year, we think we still have to have a strong value message out there. But as I have mentioned in the past, the three course and the two for 25 constructs are nowhere near as effective as they were, 24, 36 months ago, and we are tying to move away from those constructs from a promotional standpoint.","Will Slabaugh","That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up if I could, on the food cost basket. So 50 basis points, it looks like there was an improvement year-over-year. Wondering, how much of that was directly attributable to better commodities versus simply food waste [ph] or more efficiency, and what are your updates also on sort of food costs and beef in particular, given the spike that you said you saw at LongHorn this quarter?","Gene Lee","Yeah. For Olive Garden, half of our commodity favorability was dairy and shrimp. The other half was, primarily, menu mix, and we saw some improved waste which we can tie back to the simplification efforts that management has been working on for the last couple of years. Olive Garden, actually in the quarter had its best waste ever in the history of the brand, since we have been tracking. So very pleased with the operational improvements on the cost of sales side.","On beef, as I have said in the past, beef year-over-year comparisons have a lot to do with when you contracted last year. We believe that we are going to start to have some positive advantages in LongHorn, as the beef market starts to weak, and especially, we expect to see some significant improvement in the back half of the year. But as we move into 2017, we think that the beef market is going to be a much better market for us.","Will Slabaugh","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company.","Mike Tamas","Hi, great. Thanks. This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. So you have had a couple of quarters of easy comparisons at Olive Garden. Now we are going to be facing much tougher comparison. So can you maybe walk us through how you are thinking about the comps, and specifically traffic at Olive Garden, as you roll over tougher comparisons? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Yeah. I think the way we are thinking about it right now, is, how we are performing against the industry. We made great progress in the first quarter, as we -- our guest counts exceed the industry by 200 basis points. But I would caution everyone to say, that the industry did weaken from fourth quarter to first quarter. The industry was 100 basis points -- lost 100 basis points in momentum. So as we look out, I think there is two things that we are considering, what's the strength of the industry, and then what's the strength of the Olive Garden brand. And I believe, that we have strong momentum in Olive Garden right now.","I think that we are executing at a very high level. I believe that the consumer is more aware of Olive Garden today than it was a year ago. I think we have done some pretty interesting marketing campaigns, and as we have looked out, we think that although the comparisons are a little bit more difficult -- they are a little bit more difficult on the sales side. We still had some weak guest counts in the back half of last year. So I think that we will continue to outperform the industry, as we move forward.","Mike Tamas","Great, thanks. And just one quick follow-up, you have talked about paying down debt obviously, and the dividend for your [ph] two combined companies. But any thoughts on maybe doing a share buyback? I mean, by our math, it seems like you will have plenty of capacity left over, either do a dividend raise at pro forma Darden, or doing some buybacks. So any thoughts there please?","Gene Lee","We will look at the capital structure after we complete the deal, if we complete the spin-out.","Mike Tamas","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank.","Brett Levy","Good morning gentlemen. If we could spend a little bit of time talking at the Labor situation. Obviously, strong improvements across all the other line items. But can you give a little bit of your thoughts on wage, retention, turnover, and what kind of productivity you are making at the unit level?","Gene Lee","We continue to make strong productivity improvements in the direct labor line. I think our overall direct labor performance was really strong in the first quarter. I think, the increases we saw were indirect labor. As last year, we weren't accruing a lot of bonus payouts, because the performance was weak. We had good performance in the first quarter, so the majority of the labor -- there was an increase. I believe, labor was actually slightly less than last year. But it was mostly in the indirect line, as we accrued bonuses for management.","Wage pressure continues to be a problem. We will continue to monitor it, as we monitor the different states and the different cities and what they are doing with minimum wage. The job market is improving. We are seeing in certain markets today, becoming a little bit more difficult to hire help. So that will eventually put some pressure on our average wage. But right now, I believe that we are managing this very-very effectively.","Brett Levy","Would you be able to give us any sense as to what your wage rate inflation is? Are you seeing any increases in turnover, something you quantify? And also, can you give us little bit more details on where you stand on your commodity basket, not just for the next quarter, but for the full fiscal year?","Gene Lee","Sure. I will comment quickly on the wage rate. Wage rate is somewhere between 1% and 2%, and I think that's -- as we -- especially in Olive Garden, as we continue to simplify the operation, we are able to remove ours, and that changes the mix of labor hours. And if its done correctly, allows you through that mix, to keep your wage rate at or below last year, as we take out some of the higher cost production labor in the back of the house. Jeff, you want to talk about the commodities basket?","Jeff Davis","Yes. As we think about the commodities basket and what we have seen and if we can take a look at what your question is about the full year. What we are seeing right now is, that we still expect our food and beverage costs to see inflation about 1%, 1.5% which was our original guidance for the year.","The front part of the year, we are actually seeing a little more of that inflation on the expectation, as it would continue to wane, as we get through the second half of the year.","Brett Levy","And lastly, can you quantify what your G&A savings were for the quarter, and what your outlook is for the rest of this year? Thank you.","Gene Lee","We will get back to you on those specifics. We will have Kevin get back to you on the specific G&A savings. It was 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter, but there are some savings in there and some offsets to those savings. But overall, we are making great progress with our G&A and we believe our run-rate G&A for the year will be somewhere between 4.6% and 4.8%.","Operator","Does that answer your question?","Brett Levy","Oh I am sorry. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great, thank you. Two questions; just one, I think you made a comment in your prepared remarks, just about the lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, we saw that would be -- the earnings effectively double in this first quarter. So I am just wondering, if you could give some [indiscernible]. I think you said the second half margins versus the first half were going to be significantly less of an uptick. Can you just give a little more -- so what's terms of the magnitude of that and how that might translate into earnings? It seems like, just on a quarterly basis, The Street is -- struggled at least in the first quarter, that kind of nailed down the earnings. I am just trying to figure out the outlook for margin on earnings as we move to the four quarters fiscal 2016?","Gene Lee","Jeff, we expect to still have margin improvement in Q3 and Q4, it just won't be at the same rate, as it has been, since the last half of 2015. So we made great margin improvements in Q3 and Q4. We obviously had great margin improvement in Q1. We expect that we will see some more significant margin improvement in Q2. But then its going to moderate in the back half of the year.","When you look at a two year stack and we have it in the presentation, we expect there still to be margin improvement in the back half of the year. As we have stated, the big part of the earnings per share growth for the year will be in the first half of the year and we expect the second half of the year to moderate. Although, we still expect EPS to grow in the back half of the year.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got it. And then just a follow-up on earlier question about the cost savings. There was no mention there, but I am assuming its still the $50 million to $55 million in fiscal 2016. Just wondering, whether you achieved more than your pro rata share in the first quarter; because it seemed like -- well at least from an earnings guidance perspective, you raised the full year guidance of earnings without necessarily raising the comps. I am just wondering, whether the course of it is still the same, or whether there has been a shift in terms of when they are being achieved quarter-over-quarter?","Bill White","So our estimate for the year still remains $50 million to $55 million. As it relates to the savings during the course of the year, as Gene had mentioned earlier, there were some items in G&A that offset some of those savings as a result of more discrete types of items. But we expect the $50 million to $55 million for the entire year.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got it. And then just lastly Gene, you often talk about the Italian segment, since like you have a pretty good view, kind of the state of the union. I am just wondering, how you think about the segment versus Olive Garden specifically, since like Olive Garden is getting better. But the broader segment -- and do you see the entire segment doing better, or do you think its Olive Garden specific? It seems like the segment has been challenged by kind of the view of just being more celebratory, more heavy, and just not necessarily in line with the consumer trend?","Gene Lee","Yeah. I don't really want to comment too much on the segment. This segment -- however does continue to struggle. I just think that we have -- we have worked hard in Olive Garden over the last couple of years, to improve our overall value equation to the consumer. I believe that we have simplified the operation. We have added more value with the 9.99 [indiscernible] which is getting approximately 6% of sales today. We have more effectively communicated the appropriate message to our consumer, and don't underestimate what we are doing from a convenience standpoint, and really capitalizing on to really go; which I believe is exposing new guests to the Olive Garden experience, and its an experience that they really enjoy using Olive Garden for.","When I think about those four things, I think that Olive Garden is executing at a high level, and it\u2019s a culmination of a couple of year's worth of work.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason West with Credit Suisse.","Jason West","Thanks. Just going back to the real estate transaction. Can you guys talk about why you made some of the refinements in some of the store counts and things like that? And then secondly, given the chatter out there around the IRS and their no-rule position, do you think you can move forward with this without an IRS sign-off, just using a private counsel? Thanks.","Bill White","Yeah Jason, this is Bill. The refinements we made, there were just a handful of restaurants that we did exclude from the individual sale leasebacks as well as the Four Corners REIT spin, just to ensure full compliance with the covenant. And then the question about pressing forward, yeah, what we would refer you to, is some of the Form 10 filings that we have made around details of our plans. We don't really have any specifics to say about going on -- just opinion or anything otherwise. What we can say, is that we are going to be fully compliant with all the laws in place, and that we are pressing forward with the spin-off of Four Corners.","Jason West","And just one quick one, I mean, would you be able to say, given the timing you guys have proposed of November-December; what would that imply in terms of the IRS ruling, timing, to get that done on that schedule?","Bill White","I think we believe, that we are going to be in full compliance. What we can say about the IRS is that, the laws haven't changed with the revenue procedure bullets and that they have issued. So it suggests that there is not that retroactive application of any new laws they would contemplate, would not take place. So we are expecting to be able to complete our transaction by calendar year end.","Jason West","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.","Andy Barish","Hey, good morning guys. Just bouncing back on the strong Olive Garden To Go growth. Can you give us a little color maybe on how that impacts the overall quarter in terms of same store sales, with mix and traffic?","Gene Lee","Yeah, its Gene. I think -- when we look at To Go sale, it is definitely having a big impact with the overall quarter for Olive Garden. We believe -- any cannibalization its creating from our diamond businesses, we are able to fill that with the extra demand that we have for the business. So To Go is representing about 9.5% of our sales today. We have seen a 40% increase in the large party To Go sales, which we think is a huge opportunity. And I would remind everyone on the call that, for our large party takeout To Go, we are not attributing any guests for us, and it really equates to approximately 50 basis points in guest traffic that we are not accounting for.","Its all part of the strategy now to -- as the way we look at it is, its both -- what can we do in restaurant and what can we do from a takeout standpoint. We are testing delivery. We think that that is a large party delivery. We do think that's another avenue for us to really leverage, to meet the consumer's demand for this convenience.","We just have a great brand in Olive Garden, because our food travels so well. It\u2019s a great brand to take advantage of what the consumer wants today, and I think that says so much about its flexibility and so much about the strength of the brand that it can pivot from being an in-restaurant experience to a takeout experience and do really well.","And then back to what I said earlier, I think it attracts a little bit of a different consumer.","Andy Barish","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Siegner with UBS.","Keith Siegner","Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions on August Digital [ph] and just a follow-up on that last one. Can you talk about where the orders for To Go are coming now? Is this still a large component via phone? Is it via web? Do you have plans to launch enhanced mobile? Could this make the To Go growth -- could this continue for a while, as you roll some of those things?","Gene Lee","Most of the To Go orders today are still coming through the phone. We are incentivizing people to move over to the web. We are up approximately 20% online, and we continue to work to develop technology, to make it easier for our guests to access our web site, where we have introduced mobile, the adoption rate continues to rise. We know that when a consumer orders online, that their order is going -- the check average is going to be approximately 20% higher. So we are trying to incent more and more people to use that way of ordering, and hopefully over time, we can continue to get that to migrate closer to 50%, and even hopefully past that. And so we have got some technological things that I don't want to really get into a lot of detail for competitive reasons today, but we want to continue to enable our guests to be able to access Olive Garden from a takeout standpoint very easily.","Keith Siegner","Okay. And then another area I want to focus on was the in-store tech; it sounds like the roll-out of the table top tablets is going very well. You highlighted all the benefits. I was just wondering. It seems like there is a little bit of debate, let's say, in the industry about full service and loyalty programs. Can that work, could it not work? Some are trying and some are not. How do you think about the potential for loyalty, integrating into table top tablets? Is this something you are considering? Thanks.","Gene Lee","Yes. We are considering the best way to implement a loyalty program, and we think that we are in a unique position, because of our seven brands, and with that, we think we can offer something that others can't offer. ","I don't want to get into a whole lot of details from a competitive standpoint, but it is something that the team is working on. And I would say that -- that's Rick Cardenas' top priority as the Chief Strategy Officer for Darden right now. He is developing an effective loyalty program across all our brands.","Keith Siegner","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris O'Cull with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Chris O'Cull","Thanks. Good morning guys. Gene, the company looks to be on-track to have high single digit EBIT margin this year. Where do you think the long term margin should be for Darden, excluding the impact of future real estate transactions I guess?","Gene Lee","Chris, you were braking up. I couldn't hear the question.","Chris O'Cull","Let me try that again. It looks like the company is on track to have high single digit EBIT margin this year. Where do you think the long term margin should be for the company, excluding the impact of future real estate transactions?","Gene Lee","I don't want to put a number out there, that I think that we are trying to get to. I think the competitive environment dictates that. I think the commodity environment will continue to have impact on it. What I do believe is that we can still grow our margins through a few levers. Obviously, being able to leverage same restaurant sales is the most important piece we can do. I think there is still work that can be done with our menus, that we can yield a better -- whether it\u2019s a food cost percentage or a gross margin dollar at the food line.","Chris, you know how I think about that and how I think about revenue management. I think that's important. I think there is work that can still be done there. I think there is sill more efficiency in labor, which could be offset by some headwinds with wage rates. But overall, I do think there is additional costs that can come out of the system. And so, I am not going to put a number out there, where we think we can get to. But I do think that there is still a lot of margin enhancement that can be accomplished over the next few years, with the primary focus being on leveraging same restaurant sales growth.","Chris O'Cull","You said beef inflation, are you pleased with the margin performance at LongHorn?","Gene Lee","When I look at the LongHorn history over the last 18 years, and I look at where beef prices are, compared to its history. I think the operating margins are okay, and I do think that they will improve dramatically as beef comes down. The real challenge, when I look at the LongHorn business and what I have charged Todd with is, is we have got to raise the average unit volumes, and we are at approximately 3.1 today, and I believe that -- even as well as the brand has performed over the last couple of years, we need to get those top line sales closer to 3.4 million, 3.5 million, and then the operating margins will be right line to where we want it to be.","Chris O'Cull","Great. And then one last question; Bill, what gives you confidence that six LongHorns will represents a sufficiently meaningful active business in the eyes of the IRS?","Bill White","Yeah. We are not going to comment on the specifics around that. We think we have got a substantial business purpose, and a big component of that is the taxable REIT subsidiary that you're loading to the six LongHorn franchise restaurants. So we think it all holds together very well. It\u2019s a compelling story for both Four Corners and Darden for a very promising future growth story.","Chris O'Cull","Okay. Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG.","Peter Saleh","Great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to ask about the advertising budget and the plan for the rest of the year. Can you just give us an update on where you stand today in terms of the percentage of sales on the advertising budget, what you're thinking for the rest of the year? And if there has been any changes in the media mix and\/or the focus from an advertising perspective on either lunch or the To Go business?","Gene Lee","There is a lot in that question. Let me start off by saying that, we continually move the media mix every single quarter, to try to see which lever is working. So when you think about Olive Garden, you think about media mix. We have got promotional television, we have got brand television, we have got lunch television. We even got a little bit of a takeout now. And so, when we think about that, and so when we think about that, we are constantly moving how much we have in promotional, how much we have in brand, how much we have in lunch, to see which vehicle is driving the most guest comp. And so, we will continue to monitor that. We would expect our advertising spending throughout the rest of the year, to be slightly below last year, basically the same.","And what we are doing there, is we are able to -- the big thing is, we are able to cover the inflation. That's what I have charged the team with is, how do we cover the 7% to 8% media inflation, and not raise our overall costs.","We expect our all-in advertising to be really approximately -- a little bit less than 4.5% for Olive Garden, and we will leverage it down with the other brands from there. LongHorn is going to finish the year at around 3.5%.","Peter Saleh","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler","Good morning.","Gene Lee","Good morning.","Diane Geissler","Wanted to ask about the remodeling program, which is something you put on hold, while you were doing a little bit more investigative work. It sounds like you are ramping that a little bit more aggressively this year with the 25 units. Can you talk about kind of your comfort level in terms of what you think you will see in terms of your uptick? And then, in terms of the total portfolio, I think we were always thinking, it was about 250 to 300 restaurants that need to be refreshed. Can you talk about the sale leaseback -- will that impact the number of units that you potentially will remodel, just how that might impact your plans on that front?","Gene Lee","Yeah. The sale leaseback will have no impact on our refreshing our restaurants. We continue to be pleased with the initial 19 restaurants. We have got a good read on approximately 10 of those restaurants, and we are seeing approximately a 7% lift in those restaurants. We have got a couple of things going on right now, as I mentioned in the last call, we have this Olive Garden -- older colony [ph] Olive Garden of the future under development where, we are going to try to build an Olive Garden, that would be extremely -- obviously very competitive in 2025. And so, we believe through this process, as we redesign the Olive Garden of the future, not just similar to what was done back in the late 90s with the Tuscan farmhouse.","We believe its going to become some inspiration in that process, that will help us with future remodels; and so, we are going to move forward and do another 25 this year. We have got restaurants out there that we think, it can significantly benefit from this capital investment. Dave is in the team of being very strategic in which restaurants they are refreshing. In those restaurants, there is some deferred maintenance that needs to be taken care of. And so we need to get in there and do those, before we get the inspiration from [indiscernible] Olive Garden in the future.","Diane Geissler","Okay. I think part of the previous plan was that you would do it on a geographic basis, so that the consumer would see the new plan at sort of all of the local restaurants? Sounds as if it will be more kind of picking shoes in terms of what marketplace you go into? Is there a way we should be thinking about, in terms of -- like the number of units, total that need to be remodeled and how that might be staged over time and then how do you deal with sort of consumer confusion, as the restaurants look vastly different than what they have looked previously?","Gene Lee","I think the plan still is to do this by market, and each market has different needs and it depends on how many Revitalias we have in certain markets versus farmhouses. So I think that, there is a lot of efficiencies by doing the refreshes market-by-market, we can put one team in there to manage the process. So I would look for it to still be done on a market-to-market basis.","As we look forward, we haven't really determined what the pace will be. We want to get some more -- continue to get learnings from this, and I think Olive Garden of the future, down and up in operating, and we get the inspiration from that. I think we will be in a better position to lay out exactly how we are going to move forward, refreshing these Revitalia restaurants.","Diane Geissler","Okay, great. Appreciate the additional detail.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","Thank you very much. One question and then a follow-up if I may. You talked about beef favorability in 2016, and certainly 2017. One of the things I think we have noticed is that, the whole steak category has been quite strong, and it seems to be correlated with how much inflation we have seen in beef prices, just because the relative value versus grocery stores has gotten so much better. Maybe, can you give a little bit of historical perspective, is that the case, and I guess if so, as you look out to beef disinflation or deflation, would you expect to see potentially moderating topline, but better margins?","Gene Lee","Sara, I am not sure I am going to subscribe to -- as the beef markets come back, we are going to have some top line pressure. I do think we are going to have some margin improvement with that. I think overall, the steakhouse category from a value standpoint has done a better job than the bar and grill and some of the other full service dinner houses, with the overall value equation.","I think its something that over time Olive Garden had struggled with the price point for an entr\u00e9e without protein, versus a protein centric entr\u00e9e that a steakhouse restaurant is selling; and that was one of the real reasons we went back to [indiscernible] at $9.99. We felt we had to have something that competed effectively against the steakhouse category.","And so, when I think about steakhouse, I think that there is a consumer out there that's a little financially healthier, that is opting into the steakhouse experience, because of the quality and the value that you're getting in that experience. I think that's what's driving that category right now. I think we have done a better job in the steakhouse category with culinary invention and creating overall value to the consumer.","Sara Senatore","And so, in that context, you mentioned needing to get volumes higher. But to your point, the category has actually been -- LongHorn in particular, and the category generally has done a good job. What else can be done than -- to grow volumes, given that the environment actually seems pretty salutary at this point for steakhouses? So can you just talk a little bit about, when you look at it -- the value proposition could be better still, is it the brand messaging isn't perfect yet, the focus on getting volumes higher. Clearly the right one, but given that the performance actually has been very good, I am just trying to figure out, what are the levers that you have to pull?","Gene Lee","When we think about LongHorn, the issue is a little bit more geographic than overall brand. We have -- well LongHorn has a dominant market position and has a lot of legacy, we have had strong average unit volumes, we have had a little bit more growth in those markets.","What's weighing on LongHorn today, is some of the newer development that has happened over the last couple of years. And longhorn has a history of taking a little bit longer to breaking in new markets and for the consumer to really understand the value equation of that brand. And so, the big challenge for LongHorn right now, is effectively competing in marketplaces, where there is a third or fourth steakhouse in the market. And our ramp up time is taking longer than we would like.","But in our heritage market, where we have got a strong foothold, we have -- our average unit volumes are where they need to be and the margins for that business are where they need to be. So LongHorn is more about really the geographic challenges we have, as we have been growing the brand.","Sara Senatore","Great, understood. And if I may, just one quick follow-up for Jeff; we talked about moderating margin expansion, you and I have talked about some real supply chain expertise, now that you have been there a bit longer. Are there any particular areas you could talk about, what the opportunities look like to you?","Jeff Davis","I would like to just go back to the fact that, one of the opportunities we have is to leverage our scale. And as we think about how we continue to look to our supplier base, to go out and continue looking at our contracts and using that scale to bring better costs to our overall organization.","Sara Senatore","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO Capital Markets.","Andrew Strelzik","Hi, good morning everyone. I am wondering how you are thinking about kind of the multiyear growth profile of the business going forward? And given the stabilization and operational improvements that you have seen, are you getting more comfortable with potentially talking about longer term metrics and targets going forward? And if not, why not?","Gene Lee","I think that's a really good question. We are really focused right now on two things, improving the execution of our brands, and then secondarily, completing the REIT spin. I think once we get the REIT spin behind us, we will look at where we are as a company, and determine -- and look at where we are as a company, but also look at the overall operating environment, and determine what our longer term sales and EPS targets are, as we move forward for the organization.","We believe -- as we look at this today, we have made tremendous progress in the last year; and once we look at our opportunity today, we believe that, there is a chance for us to increase new restaurant growth into 2017 and 2018, and from there, be able to really determine what our long term EPS targets would be.","We need to fully understand what the capital structure is going to be, and how we are going to use our cash flow to drive shareholder value.","Andrew Strelzik","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Penney with Hedgeye Risk Management.","Howard Penney","Hi. Thank you very much. I have two questions, the first one is on the Olive Garden assets. The phrase or the word refresh has a different connotation to it than remodel. It\u2019s kind of a softer term if you will, and maybe express a little less urgency. And I was wondering if the momentum that you're seeing in the business. If I am reading that correctly, the momentum you're seeing in the business, less of a need to remodel the stores, as much as you did sort of the last two or three years? Thanks very much.","Gene Lee","Howard no, I don't think its changing the sense of urgency. I think where we are at, is we want to make sure if we are going to invest this capital to refresh, remodel, whatever we want to call it. We want to make sure it is, first and foremost, it is the appropriate amount. Second, it\u2019s going to have the desired outcome that we wanted to have. And from there, we have to pace it and we have to ensure that we continue to improve and evolve with current learnings on how to make these investments more valuable to us.","What we want to guard against, is designing a look and a feel and rolling it out, taking two or three years to do that, and you get to the end of year three and realize what you were rolling out, really isn't where you need to be today. And so our proponent of -- more of this evolving rolling refresh over time, and using your current knowledge to make those dollars work as hard as they possibly can, at the time you're making the investment.","I think it will just be wrong to lock in on a certain look and feel and just roll it out to 300 restaurants and try to go as fast as you possibly can. I want to get into the system, where we are rolling in an X number of refreshes every single year.","Howard Penney","Thank you. And then just hanging on to that last question about longer term target. I assume Gene, as you took over the role as CEO, you made a presentation to the board as to a three to five year plan, as to where you saw the business. And I was wondering in that plan, if you presented long term targets and growth in profitability and revenues and if you could share what those targets were? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Well yes Howard, I did present a longer range plan and potential for the company. But at this point in time, the pending spin and where we are at. Not at the point, where we want to give out our long range targets and I will commit to the investment community, that we will get those out in the next three to six to nine months, on what we think this business can achieve. But I want to get through this spin and understand where we are post spin, and determine what the opportunity for Darden is moving forward.","Howard Penney","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Your line is open.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?","Gene Lee","Yes Priya.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes? Okay, great. Thank you so much for taking the question. This is actually Diana Chu [ph] on for Priya. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the consent solicitation for the 35 and 37 and speak to where you are in that process? Thank you.","Bill White","Yes Diana, this is Bill White. Yes the update we would tell you is, we did not get consent for the modest increase we were seeking for the covenant basket size. But as we have said previously, that was not a condition to pursuing the real estate transactions, where we are marching forward on. So really with some pretty minor modifications in those plans, we are fully covenant compliant.","We simply don't have the extra room we were hoping to accommodate for future transactions, whether they be the -- roughly 80 or so properties, the simple properties left behind or others from future acquisitions. 20 years is a long time, but we are perfectly comfortable moving forward with our consent.","Unidentified Analyst","I see. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.","John Ivankoe","Hi, thank you so much. If the question was on labor, Gene, I think you touched on it a couple of different way of saying, you think you perhaps have an opportunity, just be more efficient at the store level. But you are acknowledging the reality that, wage rates are increasing in various parts in the United States, I guess anywhere from moderately to very significantly. So just asking about your experience, having lived through hot labor markets and changing labor markets before in the past. Does it make sense for Darden to lead by example or just lead from an employee perspective and start to change the way that employees are compensated or what their incentive structures may be? And especially as we think about maybe some significant cost of goods sold or leased, perhaps into 2016, reinvest even more in labor than maybe some of your peers are, to differentiate the business through that extent?","Gene Lee","I want to say, we believe that our employment proposition today is really strong. We compete for talent every single day. And when you look at where the average Darden employee is today, it\u2019s approximately $15 an hour, which is double the federal minimum wage. We think that through a few avenues. Our employment proposition is just incredibly strong. We have a great opportunity for employees -- all employees that grow into management. Last year, we promoted 1,000 ROIT [ph] team members into management. We have programs that allow our team members to move up to the restaurants. Our team members to go cross-brand, if they think -- after they become proficient, and maybe in a casual environment, they can move to a more polished or even a fine dining environment.","And so, as we look at this today, we keep coming back to -- there are so many things that we do for Darden team members, and it\u2019s a compelling proposition. Our turnover rates are 20% lower than our competition. We continuously win best employment practices for the majority of our brands. We think that our employees are really in a good position, and we are going to do what we need to do, to ensure that we have the best talent at all levels in our organization, and that will be -- we will be at the forefront of that. And we believe today, we are getting the best talent.","John Ivankoe","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.","Michael Walsh","Good morning. Michael Walsh filling in for Todd. Appreciate you getting us in. Just another couple quick bondholder questions. I think in the past, you have noted that you like to maintain an investment grade profile and we got a number of months here before the REIT transaction takes place, at which time, you'd look at your capital structure. But do you foresee, within that capital structure, still maintaining investment grade profile, and with that, is there any type of credit metrics that you use, whether its at least adjust the leverage target that you would manage to?","Bill White","Yes Michael, this is Bill; just to address the last part of your question first, I think you hit the nail on my head. The least adjusted -- really at least adjusted debt to EBITDA is probably one of the more key metrics we focus on and we'd be targeting in the range of 2.5 times or less, and certainly the agencies are quite comfortable that where we are moving in that direction is -- if not neutral, a positive to the credit profile. So maintaining, preserving, and solidifying the investment grade credit profile is a priority.","Michael Walsh","Got you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","At this time, I am showing no additional questions.","Kevin Kalicak","All right. So I think we are done. Thank you for your questions. I want to remind you that we expect to release our second quarter results on Friday, December 18, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you all and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference. That does conclude the call at this time.

After the presentation, we will take your questions until approximately 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time.","With that, let the turn it over to Clarence.","Clarence Otis","Thank you, Matthew. Industry conditions this quarter are an affirmation that our industry is in a period of significant change. And to better address that change, this morning, we announced the comprehensive strategic action plan that includes spinning off Red Lobster, reducing new unit expansion, a more intensive focus on operating cost efficiency and refining our incentive compensation plan. The actions we're taking are clearly exciting steps forward for Darden, and we believe these actions enhance our ability to create compelling value for our shareholders. Let me touch briefly upon our sales results for this quarter.","Once again, LongHorn had competitively strong same-restaurant sales results, and our Specialty Restaurant Group continued to maintain good momentum. Importantly, we also had good same-restaurant sales progress at Olive Garden, which had significant improvement compared to the first quarter and closed its gap to the industry benchmark by a considerable amount this quarter. And Gene is going to discuss Olive Garden's plan and progress against that plan in a little bit more detail in a moment. In contrast to the rest of the business, Red Lobster had significant deterioration this quarter.","And we'll discuss our strategic action plan, as Matthew said, further shortly. But first, let me ask Brad to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail. Brad?","C. Bradford Richmond","Thank you, Clarence, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter financial results was short of what we expected when we spoke with you in September largely because same-restaurant sales and guest counts were below our expectations. Second quarter financial results were also adversely affected by 2 unusual items that, together, totaled approximately $0.05 EPS. First, there were certain costs associated with the support expense reduction we announced in September. These adversely affected earnings by a net of the benefit by $0.02. Second, there were advisory and other costs associated with the completion of the strategic review that is the basis for the action plan announced today, including the plan to separate Red Lobster. These adversely affected earnings by approximately $0.03.","As we look forward to the full fiscal year, our outlook for total sales and earnings has changed since we spoke with you at the beginning of the second quarter. Given the continued industry sales softness and trends at our brands, we now anticipate total sales growth in the range of 4% to 5%. This reflects our expectation that same-restaurant sales for the year will decline 4% to 5% at Red Lobster and 1% to 2% at Olive Garden and increase 2% to 3% at LongHorn Steakhouse. Our outlook assumes that comparable sales for the industry will be flat to down 1% this year, which is about 50 to 100 basis points lower than we had expected before.","With our lower sales expectations, we anticipate that diluted net earnings per share will be down between 15% and 20%. The primary reason for this change since we last spoke to you is a downward adjustment in our expectation for Red Lobster for the year. That downward adjustment reflects Red Lobster's first half trend and the potential for some disruption there as we complete the spinoff. The earnings expectation for the year includes the onetime items we incurred in the second quarter but excludes incremental costs incurred during the balance of the year in connection with the strategic action announced today.","Now turning more specifically to the second quarter. Darden's total sales from continuing operations increased 4.6% to $2.05 billion. On a blended same-restaurant sales basis, the results for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse declined 1.0% in the quarter, with strength at LongHorn Steakhouse offset primarily by weakness at Red Lobster. Olive Garden made good progress but not quite as much as we had anticipated. And we saw continued same-restaurant sales gains in each of our Specialty Restaurant brands with the group achieving a positive 4.1% same-restaurant sales growth on a blended basis.","Food and beverage expenses for the quarter were approximately 35 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis. The unfavorable price increase was driven by higher shrimp and land-based protein costs.","For the second quarter, restaurant labor expenses were approximately 65 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to wage inflation, reduced productivity and sales de-leverage at Red Lobster. Restaurant expenses in the quarter were approximately 40 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis because of higher repairs and maintenance across all brands, higher workers' comp expense and the sales de-leverage at Red Lobster.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 25 basis points lower than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to decreased media expense at Red Lobster and Olive Garden. Depreciation expense in the quarter was approximately 20 basis points higher on a percentage of sales basis compared to last year because of the increase in new units and remodel programs at our larger brands.","Our tax rate this quarter at a credit of 9.4% was approximately 30 percentage points lower than the prior year, driven by available tax credits and our tax planning initiatives. We now estimate that our annual effective rate will be approximately 17%, which is about 400 basis points lower than last year's annual effective tax rate. This annual effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter, though.","In the second quarter, reported total company operating profit margins fell by approximately 140 basis points compared to the prior year. Our cash from operating activities increased -- excuse me, from operating activities increased by over $35 million through the second quarter of the fiscal year as changes in working capital declined as part of our ongoing supply chain optimization cost savings initiative.","Now turning to our commodity cost outlook. We have approximately 53% of our total food spend contracted through the end of the fiscal year. That's roughly in line with the 60% we had last year at this time. We have not take -- fully covered our usage through the remainder of the fiscal year because we believe that premiums for future contracts are simply too great given where we expect prices to be in the cash markets as we look out.","Food inflation in the second quarter was approximately 2.4%, with shrimp inflation in the high teens and land-based protein inflation in the mid single-digit range. Shrimp inflation is expected to increase in our third and fourth fiscal quarters, primarily related to production issues in Asia. We don't anticipate relief on shrimp until early in fiscal 2015. For the current fiscal year, our expectation is that our commodity basket will see net inflation in the range of 2.5% to 3%, which is about 50 basis points higher, primarily driven by shrimp, than we expected in June but is consistent with the expectation we talked about in September.","Now category by category, through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, seafood costs are higher on a year-over-year basis with 75% of our usage coverage; beef costs are higher with 55% of our usage coverage; poultry costs are slightly higher with 40% of our usage covered; wheat costs are lower with 30% of our usage covered; and dairy costs are slightly higher on a year-over-year basis with 15% of our usage covered. Our energy costs are expected to be slightly unfavorable on a year-to-year basis, and we have contracted the majority of our natural gas and electricity usage in the deregulated markets in which we operate for the remainder of the fiscal year.","And now let me turn it over to Gene to discuss Olive Garden's progress.","Eugene I. Lee","Thank you, Brad, and good morning. Olive Garden continues to make progress towards our goal of renewed same-restaurant sales momentum. Same-restaurant sales results for the quarter trailed the industry modestly, and our same-restaurant guest count results were better than the industry. This represents an improving trend relative to the competition and reflects successful implementation of some early pieces of the brand renaissance plan that Dave George and his team put in place following Dave's appointment as President of the Olive Garden in January.","The first phase of the plan involves simplifying operations, systems and processes. Dave and his team have redesigned kitchen processes to reduce complexity in food preparation and on the line. These changes have resulted in significant labor savings. And even more important, they've led to significant improvements in the food we're serving our guests. While some of the labor cost savings are flowing through to earnings, we're using some to fund other improvements in Olive Garden's guest experience with a particular emphasis on elevating the quality of our proteins.","In the kitchen, we've also completed the rollout of our new Piaztra [ph] grills, which is a flattop surface grill. It's made our grilling simpler and significantly enhanced our grilling capabilities. Finally, we see a number of other opportunities to further simplify and enhance kitchen operations, and our culinary and operations teams are prioritizing these opportunities.","As we work to reduce kitchen complexity, we're also simplifying the front-of-the-house operation. One example is our steps of service at lunch. We have revamped so that our guests can, if they chose to, have a much quicker lunch experience at Olive Garden. As a result of what we've already done to simplify what we do operationally, Olive Garden has seen great improvement in its overall guest satisfaction scores on both a quarterly sequential basis and compared to prior year.","Beyond operational simplification, since Dave became President in January, the Olive Garden team has invested considerable time and resources in rethinking the core menu. That team includes Jim Nuetzi, who has been the Executive Chef at Olive Garden for the past year and was Executive Chef at The Capital Grille for the prior 11 years. We're addressing the need our more financially stretched guests have for everyday value by developing more innovative entry price offerings with a keen focus on making sure that these items have great quality and represent meaningful variety.","In parallel, to increase our attractiveness to guests who are not financially constrained and want more differentiated Italian fare than we've been offering recently, we've been developing more culinary-forward offerings across a full range of price points but with particular focus on higher price points.","From a promotional perspective, we expect to make these new compelling -- we expect to make these compelling new core menu items, both those that target financially constrained guests and that target more financially comfortable guests, the focal point of our promotions. In terms of timing, we have multiple tests of new core menu items and platforms in markets now, and we're very pleased with the initial reactions from our guests. We expect many of these items and platforms to be introduced nationally sometime this fiscal year.","Remodels are important part of our future. Remodeling our approximately 400 non-Tuscan farmhouse restaurants is an important part of the brand renaissance plan for Olive Garden, and we have design options we're excited about. The design teams have been focused on expressing today's Italy in a casual dining environment. We'll complete testing over the next several months, and our goal is to remodel 50 to 70 restaurants over the next 12 months.","For competitive reasons, I've intentionally been relatively high level about the various aspects of our brand renaissance plan. I can tell you, however, that I'm excited. I'm excited because we continue to make progress on the select few things that, together, will strengthen what, given Olive Garden's industry-leading restaurant level sales and returns, is already a strong brand. And we're confident that improving brand relevance will drive sustained same-restaurant guest counts and sales growth well into the future. What I will promise you is that I'll discuss these initiatives in quite a bit more detail at our Investor Conference in March.","Now we'll turn it to Clarence to discuss our strategic action plan.","Clarence Otis","Thanks, Gene. And as I said at the outset, we're very excited about the strategic action plan. It is a comprehensive plan to enhance shareholder value, and we appreciate this opportunity to review that plan with you. To help with that review, we've prepared a short slide presentation summarizing key elements of the plan. And I'll use that to help guide my remarks. Now Matthew has already referenced our disclosure around forward-looking statements, and so we can move right to Slide 3.","Darden is a premiere full-service restaurant company with excellent brands and tremendous expertise in the areas that matter most to success in our industry. Following an extensive internal review, our board has approved a new direction forward that leverages our market position, our brands, our expertise and our other assets to better address some important changes in consumer demand and competitive dynamics in the restaurant industry. It's a plan that will help us most effectively increase long-term shareholder value.","In developing this plan, we assessed a number of alternative ways to segment our portfolio of brands and leverage our other assets, including our real estate. We're excited about the path we've chosen because it enables us to continue to benefit from the complementary strengths of our brands. We'll be able to generate strong cash flows that support continuation of our current dividend on a combined basis post separation, as well as meaningful growth and return of capital at Darden post separation while funding expansion of the business at a rate that continues to build market share.","The first element of the plan is the separation of Red Lobster. Although no final decision has been made on the form of separation, we do expect to execute this transaction as a tax-free spinoff to our shareholders that would close in early fiscal 2015. However, we may also consider a sale of Red Lobster as a potential alternative for maximizing shareholder value.","The second element of the plan involves some changes in capital allocation. Now these include reducing capital expenditures through suspension of new unit growth at Olive Garden following completion of a few units that are well down the development and construction pipeline, more limited new unit growth at LongHorn and continuing new unit growth at the Specialty Restaurant Group at a pace that is modestly below this year's level. This will lower our ongoing capital expenditure requirement by approximately $100 million annually, freeing up cash to return to our shareholders. In addition, we're affirming our decision to forego additional acquisitions for the foreseeable future, and that will also help ensure more consistent return of capital to shareholders.","The third element of the plan involves increased focus on operating support cost efficiency. The last quarter, we announced our intention to reduce operating support cost by $50 million annually. And since then, we've identified an additional $10 million in savings, bringing ongoing annual support cost savings to at least $60 million. In addition, and perhaps most importantly, we will focus much more intensively on operating support cost reduction as we complete the separation of Red Lobster and following the separation. And we'll do that in order to ensure that our cost structure is as lean and efficient as practical for the business.","The fourth element of our plan involves changes in our management compensation incentive plans. Our board has decided to refine those plans, beginning with the performance plans for next fiscal year to more directly emphasize same-restaurant sales growth and free cash flow growth. This is a step that will better align management incentives with 2 performance measures that are even more important given the other changes we're making and that play a significant role in driving shareholder value creation in the restaurant business generally.","Again, as we make these strategic changes, we expect that on a combined basis, the 2 companies will maintain Darden's current quarterly dividend level of $0.55 a share. The strategic action plan we're pursuing will significantly enhance shareholder value. By separating Red Lobster from the rest of the business, this plan better enables the management teams of the 2 companies to focus on what are increasingly divergent operating and strategic priorities and quite distinct value creation opportunities. Following the separation, Darden will also have a meaningfully stronger sales and earnings growth profile. And the other elements of the plan will support further return to capital to shareholders, which is going to be key strategic focus for both companies going forward.","Slide 4 provides a summary of how we expect the spinoff transaction to work. Again, we anticipate that Red Lobster will be spun off as a separate publicly traded company sometime early fiscal 2015. Now this is all subject to regulatory and third-party approvals, as well as confirmation of tax-free treatment. Post spinoff, we expect the new Darden to use proceeds from new debt raised at the new Red Lobster to retire a portion of Darden's existing debt. This should result in a flat to modest overall improvement in Darden's leverage levels. We currently have an investment-grade credit rating. That rating is very important to us strategically, and we expect the new Darden to preserve it going forward.","In addition, we expect new Darden to maintain an attractive, consistently growing dividend. And as earnings grow over time, we should be able to gradually reduce our dividend payout ratio even as our dividend also grows. Again, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase will also be a priority going forward, and we expect to be able to increase our repurchase level in the near term based on the steps we're taking and then over time as cash flow grows.","The new Red Lobster will have a capital structure that's optimized to leverage the strong cash flow generation profile of that business. And we anticipate that this will result in a strong non-investment-grade credit rating. Significant return of capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase will also be a priority at the new Red Lobster, with a stronger bias toward dividends initially.","Slide 5 provides an overview of the strategic rationale for the separation of Red Lobster. It's increasingly clear to us that Red Lobster's operating priorities are different in some very important ways from those of the rest of Darden. And these differences stem from the fact that the appropriate guest targets for the 2 parts of the business are increasingly divergent.","Now all of our brands have been focused on 2 things: maintaining relevance to guests who fit their core profile; and increasing relevance in pockets of consumer strength that are outside their core. As we pursue these 2 objectives to a large extent, the brands benefit from shared marketing, culinary, digital and other resources. When we talk about pockets of consumer strength, one example is more financially secure consumers. Another is younger consumers given just the sheer size of that category. With the exception of Red Lobster, all of our brands are having success increasing their relevance to these various pockets of strength.","At Olive Garden, for example, we had 11% more visits last year, fiscal 2013, from guests with household income over $100,000 than we did 5 years earlier in fiscal 2008. And for that same period, visits to LongHorn from those guests with income demographic increased by more than 50%. In contrast, Red Lobster traffic from this income demographic was flat in 2013 compared to 2008. And the results are similar when it comes to other efforts to broaden the guest base. As a result, we believe Red Lobster will benefit from sharper focus on its core. A separation will enable it to do just that while the rest of the business continues working to both retain their core and expand their customer base.","Because of these differences in appropriate guest targets, Red Lobster and the rest of Darden have significantly different sales and earnings growth prospects. They have significantly different sales and earnings volatility and capital requirements. And ultimately, they have quite separate and distinct opportunities to drive long-term shareholder value. The spinoff will transform Darden into 2 new independent public companies that can each focus on their different opportunities. And finally, a spinoff, when combined with the other actions we're taking, will result in stronger alignment of management incentive compensation, increased financial transparency and improve our ability to serve differing shareholder investment objectives.","The Slide 6 lays out the new unit cost management and return to capital direction for new Darden. As indicated, we expect the new Darden to be able to achieve higher same-restaurant sales growth, have more moderate new unit expansion and CapEx needs, have the benefit of greater than initially forecast cost savings and a much more intensive ongoing focus on cost reduction, all of which repositions the business for further enhanced return of capital to shareholders through both consistently growing dividends and consistent, meaningful and growing share repurchase.","Going forward, there will be minimal new growth -- new unit growth at Olive Garden, and LongHorn's new unit openings will be reduced dramatically, going to 15 to 20 units annually from the 30 to 35 we've been targeting previously. This represents approximately 25 fewer units annually for Olive Garden and LongHorn. And in addition, new unit growth within our Specialty Restaurant Group will be reduced modestly by about 5 units annually to 20 to 25 new restaurants a year.","Together, these changes will result in approximately $100 million less in new unit capital expenditures, reducing our current annual new unit capital expenditures to $200 million, down from about $300 million today. And again, we plan to redirect the improved cash flow from reduced CapEx and cost savings toward enhanced return of capital to shareholders primarily in the beginning in the form of additional share repurchase.","As shown on Slide 7, both companies will be well positioned for continued success following the transition. New Darden's core strategic focus will be on retaining core customers and expanding our customer base. And while both of these things, expanding our customer base and new unit growth, will require selective investment, both will also support cash flow growth, enable us to consistently increase the amount of capital return to shareholders. New Red Lobster's focus will largely be on retaining its core customers and on using its strong and consistent cash flow generation to support what will be a more stable rather than growing return of capital to shareholders.","As a financial metrics highlight, both new businesses will have the average unit volumes and the overall earnings and EBITDA scale to continue to be leaders in the full-service restaurant segment. However, each business will have its own distinct financial strategy, one that best serves its shareholders. While New Darden, as I said earlier, will have an investment-grade credit for profile and reduced overall debt load, new Red Lobster will operate as a strong non-investment-grade credit with leverage level that's supported by its strong free cash flow profile and that will be in line with other similarly cash flow oriented restaurant peers. In addition, we expect new Red Lobster to have a dividend payout ratio of approximately 75% on an ongoing basis, while New Darden will have an initial payout ratio that's between 70% and 75%. That ratio will be reduced over time as earnings growth exceeds overall dividend growth.","Slide 8 provides a snapshot of the financial performance of both businesses over time. And as you can see, Darden, excluding Red Lobster, has grown sales robustly over the past few years. And while EBITDA has flattened recently, it's still well above where it was 3 years ago. Conversely, Red Lobster has had fairly consistent rather than growing sales, and its EBITDA has been pressured recently, largely by both increased promotional activity and elevated seafood costs. Red Lobster's management team will be working to develop stronger, more targeted plans to reinvigorate sales and stabilize cash flow going forward.","Slide 9 gives you an overview of New Darden. As you can see, we will hold a balanced portfolio of best-in-class brands, a portfolio that combines proven brands that have leadership positions and strong cash flow, with others that are proven but earlier stage and have significant runway for additional unit expansion. We see an attractive sales and earnings profile for New Darden with mid- to high single-digit revenue growth and low- to mid-teen operating income growth.","In terms of cash flows, reduced new unit capital expenditure, increased support cost efficiency and meaningful free cash flow growth over time will also allow for greater return of capital to shareholders. And with this financial profile, as well as the strong collective experience and expertise that's buttressed by improved incentive alignment and what will continue to be a winning culture, we believe New Darden will have much improved, long-term shareholder value creation prospects.","Slide 10 provides key highlights about our portfolio of compelling brands. So Olive Garden is one of the largest full-service dining brands in the United States and is the #1 Italian full-service brand in the country. As a result of very strong average sales per restaurant and a superior business model, Olive Garden also has industry-leading unit-level and brand-level returns. And as Gene outlined earlier, Dave George and the team at Olive Garden are making good progress on a number of fronts that will enable the brand to stabilize and then return to industry leadership on same-restaurant sales and further improve on its industry-leading position overall. We look forward, as Gene said, to be able to share some details about Olive Garden's plan with you certainly at our investor meeting in March but also as we get further into the separation process.","LongHorn is also a leading brand. And since we acquired the brand 7 years ago, LongHorn has been transformed and is now poised to become America's favorite steakhouse. LongHorn's trends from a unit economics perspective are attractive as well. And then finally, our Specialty Restaurant Group is organized to leverage experienced leadership cadre to drive the growth and success of 5 premiere high-volume, high-return brands that each have compelling and differentiated guest propositions.","Now this morning, we have emphasized return of capital to shareholders because it will continue to be a key priority for both companies moving forward. And as shown on Slide 11, Darden has a long track record of returning capital to shareholders with almost $4 billion returned through share repurchase and dividends over the last decade.","Slide 12 highlights what will remain the same and what will be some of the key differences for Darden post-separation. Darden will remain a leading multi-brand operator with a balanced portfolio of brands, and our commitment to quality and menu innovation will continue, as will our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We will continue to have a strong cash flow profile. We expect to retain our investment-grade credit profile, and our business will continue to be supported by an experienced management team that's passionate about its brands.","So what's different? As I said earlier, we expect higher and more consistent sales and earnings growth driven by an expanding customer base and restaurant footprint. We'll also have a more balanced commodity purchasing profile, reduced quarterly sales and earnings volatility, more meaningful growth in free cash flow, improving credit metrics and an even sharper focus throughout the company on same-restaurant sales and free cash flow growth, which again are even more important given our new strategic direction.","Now let me briefly highlight what new Red Lobster will look like post separation. The key strengths and opportunity for the business lie in its heritage as an iconic American brand that helped pioneer the casual dining sector, its strong and consistent annual free cash flow generation and the dedicated and highly experienced team that will lead the business. With the improved guest targeting that the spin will enable, Red Lobster will, we believe, more quickly and more sustainably achieve same-restaurant sales stability and margin improvement.","And then looking out, we think that as a standalone company, Red Lobster can generate low-single digit revenue growth and mid- to high single-digit operating income growth. Given its core guest base and the nature of seafood, there will continue to be volatility in quarterly sales and earnings results. But in contrast, annual cash flows have been strong and consistent, and that's expected to continue. And Red Lobster's cash flows, the new Red Lobster, should support substantial and stable return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.","We are truly excited about the quality of the management team we've assembled to lead Red Lobster following separation. Kim Lopdrup, who will serve as CEO, brings strong leadership capabilities, with extensive experience with Red Lobster and in the food service industry generally. Kim currently serves as President of the Specialty Restaurant Group and was President of Red Lobster from our fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2011. And during this time, he spearheaded the revitalization of the brand, a revitalization that resulted in strong sales and earnings growth. Kim is the right person to lead and deliver on the strategic objectives for the new Red Lobster. Kim will be supported by Salli Setta, who will continue in her role as President of the Red Lobster. And should, as expected, the separation take the form of a spinoff, Brad Richmond, who's been Darden's CFO for nearly 7 years, will be Chief Financial Officer of the new Red Lobster.","Post separation, Red Lobster will continue to be an iconic American casual dining brand with a dominant position in the casual dining seafood special segment. The business will also continue to have a strong and steady cash flow profile aided by a leaner organizational structure, and the fact that following the Bar Harbor remodel program that's nearing completion, its repairs and maintenance CapEx requirements will be modest.","So all in all, we're absolutely thrilled about the comprehensive strategic action plan that we've put in place. Now let me close by reiterating what Brad covered at the outset, which is our outlook for fiscal 2014. We now expect to open approximately 75 net new restaurants this year. That compares to our prior expectation of 80. Same-restaurant sales are expected to be down 1% to 2% for Olive Garden and up 2% to 3% for LongHorn, and that is down somewhat in each case from our earlier expectations since we now believe that for the full year, the industry will be softer than we previously anticipated.","The biggest change, as Brad said, from previous expectations is in Red Lobster's same-restaurant sales, which we now expect to be down 4% to 5%. As Brad indicated, this reflects first half results at Red Lobster as well as the potential for some disruption as we work through the separation. Combined with our same-restaurant expectations for the Specialty Restaurant Group, all of this means that we now expect overall revenue growth of 4% to 5%, which is below our previous estimate of 6% to 8%. And with the sales shortfall and the second quarter costs associated with our new strategic direction, we now expect net diluted EPS for fiscal 2014, excluding any second half costs related to the strategic action plan, to decline 15% to 20%.","Once again, as we look forward, we're very excited about our comprehensive action plan. This is a plan that reflects thoughtful discussions among our management team, our board, our shareholders and our advisers. And we're confident that this plan offers the most potential to enhance long-term shareholder value. As Slide 18 highlights, we have a significant amount of work to do in the coming months, but we promise to keep shareholders apprised of our progress as we make this exciting transition.","That brings us to the end of our prepared remarks. And so now we'd like to open it up to questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So prior to an activist investor getting involved, I'm curious how many of the business model strategy shifts that you guys outlined this morning have you been considering, and that's specifically the idea of a standalone Red Lobster.","Clarence Otis","Yes, we've actually -- we've been really reviewing the business pretty comprehensively for some time now. And it reflects what we've been seeing in the industry. And so last year was disappointingly -- our last fiscal year, from an industry perspective, disappointingly weak. So the same-restaurant results less than 1% coming after a year that was not particularly strong. We had anticipated something stronger than that. And we also, as we put our plan together for this year, assumed that this year would look like last year. So we did not assume improvement. We thought that was a relatively conservative assumption. And as the year unfolded, it's been even weaker than last year. And in the face of all of that, we've been looking pretty comprehensively at our plan. We've been talking to a lot of our long-term shareholders, and we've been thinking about various alternatives that might make sense in terms of adjustments to our plan. And Red Lobster's been part of that thinking. The separation Red Lobster has been part of it. Our new unit expansion pace has been part of that thinking, and support cost reduction has been part of that thinking. We got further along faster on the support cost reduction part, and so we announced that a little bit in advance of the rest of it. But we've been looking at it for a while.","Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just one other quick follow-up. Just looking at the numbers, it looks like the majority or at least the lion's share of that combined $60 million in cost management efforts will be at the corporate level. So I'm just curious why you have not been more aggressive or what theoretically is preventing you from being more aggressive at the restaurant level in terms of pursuing cost efforts across management within the restaurants themselves?","Clarence Otis","Yes, and I think a couple of thoughts. One is Gene talked about some of the things that Olive Garden has done as it tries to simplify operations. And the goal is twofold. I mean, one is to improve execution. And we believe we're doing that based upon the consumer satisfaction feedback that we're getting. And the second is to be more cost efficient in the restaurant. And some of those cost efficiencies are flowing through. Some of them we're reinvesting in the guest experience. But Olive Garden, for example, had an operating profit increase this quarter despite same-restaurant sales are a little bit below what we had anticipated. And some of those in-restaurant cost savings are part of that. We are further along at Olive Garden on that score than we are at LongHorn, but that's certainly a focus at LongHorn as well. And it will be more of a focus at Red Lobster.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Co.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","On the business separation, you're separating a business in Red Lobster that has been a major headwind on your performance. But the decision to keep Olive Garden in this new DRI is a big decision because its performance was such a large sensitivity factor on the earnings profile of the new DRI, and it doesn't necessarily completely separate or allow the growth brands that are performing well to be in their own dynamic. It will likely still be a company that as Olive Garden goes, so goes the company. So the first question, I think, number one, and I'll have a follow-up after this, is why exactly do you want to keep Olive Garden in that portfolio and not separate it as well? Same-store sales were still negative this quarter against what were pretty easy comparisons. And I know traffic outperformed the industry, but we're still dealing with the negative comps there.","Clarence Otis","Yes, I touched upon a little bit of it earlier. So I mean, the priorities really at Olive Garden away from unit growth are very similar to the priorities at the other brands. So we're trying to make sure we maintain relevance to our core consumers and that we broaden our reach to some other consumers that are in some pockets of strength. And we're seeing Olive Garden be able to do that. And so all the support that we have, the integrated support structure that works operationally for our other brands works operationally for Olive Garden. The other thing I would say is that Olive Garden has always been, and is today, a significant piece of the Darden story. So that doesn't change. Olive Garden's sales and earnings results, though, are much less volatile than Red Lobster's. And so we don't see the same volatility going forward. And the other thing is that Olive Garden's cash flow growth as we stabilize same-restaurant sales, even without unit sales, is significant. And it really benefits the rest of the brands to have not just that absolute cash flow generation but that growth in cash flow. And it benefits shareholders because it drives growth, meaningful growth, along with the new unit growth at the balance of the business and free cash flow.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what was impressive is under a slightly negative comp, not only was the operating profit margin was up at Olive Garden and the absolute profits were up. Is there any way you can comment on the magnitude that operating profits were up at Olive Garden in the quarter?","Clarence Otis","Brad?","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes. I think first off, that speaks to the part of the earlier question. There's cost savings occurring in the restaurant. A lot of that is being reinvested beyond the $60 million that we talked about. But I would say from a margin perspective, it was pretty significant both in terms of the basis points. We don't get to brand specifics, but it was meaningful for us. And obviously, with the new unit growth, which those [ph] new unit growth, they're profitable sales growth, the magnitude of the absolute profit was something that we're pleased with the progress. As Gene said, we're excited with where we are and where we can go forward from here. So I'm feeling much better about where the brand is. And as Clarence mentioned earlier, they're further along than LongHorn in making some of these moves that we've talked about. So we're pleased.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. And just lastly, do you know when we might get a full Red Lobster P&L?","C. Bradford Richmond","No, that's something we're in the process of right now. So we need to get to the audited process to really share those given the nature of what we're talking about. So it will be probably a couple of months out, but as soon as we have those available, we will start the share those with the investment community.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer of RBC.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I have 3 super short questions, which I'll just rattle off to you guys. Darden owns, I believe, about 50% of the land, 85% of the buildings across the business. How is that different at Red Lobster? My sense is it might be higher than that. That's first. And second, can you spin off this Red Lobster business without overhead de-leverage to the remaining co.? And third, can you give a little bit more detail about the executive incentive structure and how that's changing?","Clarence Otis","I'll start with the second and third and let Brad answer the first on real estate. And so there are -- there is some additional support cost that we would incur as a consequence of the separation. We are working to minimize those. So Red Lobster is going to be a lean organization as a standalone company. And Darden, excluding Red Lobster, would be a leaner organization beyond the cost savings that we've already announced. We're not in a position at this early stage really to give a sense of the magnitude of that. That is something that we will get into, though, as we get further along. But we feel confident that we can minimize those incremental support costs that come with having 2 companies. The third question was on incentives. So from an incentive perspective, right now, our incentives are driven by sales growth and earnings growth. So both our annual incentives and our multiyear performance stock units. And we would expect that same-restaurant sales would be part of the annual incentive as opposed to total sales. And then we are looking to have a measure of free cash flow growth for the multiyear, where we think that, that's appropriate as opposed to earnings per share. But there's still some work to do there from the board's perspective to settle on the specifics, and we'll update you on those as the board reaches some final conclusions.","C. Bradford Richmond","Now on your first part of the question, we detailed some of that on Slide 7 of the presentation. So you can see, with where we are today of the 705 Red Lobsters, 473 of those would be where we own the real estate. So that's just a little under half of Darden today's owned property. So a lot of it will move to Red Lobster. The remainder of the Red Lobster units are virtually all land leased and that we own the building on those.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Duvick of Wells Fargo Securities.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First of all, I appreciate your comments about the plans to pay down debt and maintain your investment-grade credit rating. And I guess just one question I have related to that, can you tell us if you've vetted this with the rating agencies? And if not, when do you plan to talk to them about your plan?","Clarence Otis","Yes, we've been in dialogue with them. And so we've received some feedback. We're continuing to share information with them. Obviously, they're going to make their own determination. But we have a good track record from the past of working to take the actions that we think are necessary to preserve investment credit profile. We know it's very important from a strategic perspective. And so on the new Darden side, we will continue to work aggressively to ensure we retain that type of profile.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just with respect to with respect to the Barrington proposal. They talked about the formation of a REIT for the real estate. Is that something that is in consideration of -- with Darden management currently?","Clarence Otis","Well, as we conducted this review, one of the things we did was evaluate the potential for a REIT. And as we went through that evaluation, we believe that the value creation opportunity is limited. And we believe that, that's the case because the Darden REIT may trade at a lower multiple than others so the net lease REIT and the substantial debt breakage cost that are involved. And so that is not something that we think makes sense going forward. And we think the plan that we've outlined is a plan that best creates shareholder value.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. I guess first question, you're halting all Olive Garden unit growth at this point. Is this, in your view, a temporary move given your current situation and you expect to grow units again in the future? Or have you come to a new conclusion about the brand's unit growth opportunity from here?","Clarence Otis","No, I think it's really that we think the focus at Olive Garden needs to be on regaining same-restaurant momentum. And so this is a suspension really that would last the next 3 years at a minimum. So that's what we see. In terms of the ultimate unit potential, we think the ultimate unit potential is still much higher than where we are today. And the reason we think that is as we look at the units that Olive Garden's -- the new units that Olive Garden's opened over the last 4 years, they exceed -- despite the slump at the business overall in the last couple of years, those units still exceed our return hurdles from a return on capital investment perspective by a substantial amount. But the key priority right now is to make sure that the base business is as strong as possible. And we think that suspension of new unit growth is appropriate to do that. And we also think that it's appropriate because it boosts free cash flow and enables us to return more capital to shareholders near term and improve our credit metrics, both of which are very high priorities over the next several years.","Eugene I. Lee","Mike, I would just add that this is about focus in Olive Garden right now, and this allows us to take some resources that we're spending time on opening 15 to 20-plus restaurants a year and put them on the this brand renaissance project, which we're -- again, as I said, we're very excited about. And so to me, it's really about just focusing on regaining same-restaurant sales momentum. And this is an important part of that effort.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The other question I had is you mentioned in your prepared remarks that SG&A was lower this quarter from reduced marketing expenses at Red Lobster and Olive Garden. Is that just the timing of initiatives or have you decided to reduce your annual budget for marketing for the brand more broadly?","Clarence Otis","Yes. I would say it's 2 different answers. So for Olive Garden, that's just timing. For Red Lobster, we believe there's an opportunity to reduce marketing as a percent of sales. Over the last couple of years, it's floated up higher than is sustainable. And that's going to be a key focus area for the new Red Lobster going forward. Olive Garden marketing as a percent sales is in a place that makes sense for a national brand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Buckley of Bank of America.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You had said in the presentation that you gave us that the key to whether this could create value or not is on those operating income growth numbers, low- to mid-teens at the new Darden and mid- to high-single digits at the new Red Lobster. Why are those credible given the track record?","Clarence Otis","Well, we think that the key at the New Darden really is to stabilize same-restaurant sales growth at Olive garden. And we are confident in the plan we've got to do that. We also will get past some of the onetime headwinds that we've got that have depressed earnings such as some of the incentive resets that we've talked about in the past. But we think the key really is to stabilize sales at Olive Garden. We're seeing improvement relative to competition. And so as we said, we're closing that gap. We've got other things in the pipeline that Gene talked about that give us confidence we'll continue to close it. At Red Lobster, we believe that the focus that they will get on target guests, on core guests, as a result of the separation will make a significant difference that they have been, along with the other brands, really trying to broaden the reach that works for the other brands. It's been working. They are broadening their reach. Red Lobster has not had success there. And so additional focus on core guests and away from sort of trying to broaden reach, we think, will help Red Lobster significantly.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So when you look at those 2 growth metrics, the ones at the New Darden and the ones at the new Red Lobster, what kind of Olive Garden same-store sales growth do you need to get to mid- to high-teens operating income growth? And what kind of Red Lobster same-store sales growth do you need to get to mid- to high single digits?","Clarence Otis","I'd say in each case, 1% or 2%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason West of Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple of modeling questions. I didn't quite see if you guys put it in the presentation. But how much of the dividend and the balance sheet debt will sort of get allocated to Red Lobster under the new structure?","Clarence Otis","That is still to be determined. So until we are further along in the audit work, of course, we can't answer yet. But we will provide that information as soon as it's available.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I think there was $260 million EBITDA number for Red Lobster. I don't remember if that was LTM or if that was fiscal '13, but I'm assuming you guys are modeling that number quite a bit lower for fiscal '14. I mean, any sense of what that number is going to look like on a run rate basis for Red Lobster given the new guidance today?","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes. What we're showing there, I should remind everyone, is unaudited financial results. So that's going to change some. But that's a good basis to work from. And as we talked about for the current year, the lower same-restaurant sales expectation of Red Lobster, there is about a flow-through that lowers sales expectations, 30% to 35%. And so to your point, it will be lower but not as dramatic lower as folks may think. And it tends to be an opinion of the impact of same-restaurant sales for Darden. 1% across all brands for an annual basis is about $32 million, $33 million in operating cash flow. So it is important to the health of the brand, but it's not as dramatic as its impact on the overall operating profit in the near term. So I'd just remind you that until we can get out and share more specific numbers on those measures.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And just one other quick one. Clarence, you mentioned the REIT structure and you looked at that and you said Darden, you think, would have a lower multiple than other REITs and there would be substantial debt breakage costs. Can you just talk a little bit more about those 2 factors and what that means in terms of why the REIT doesn't make sense exactly?","Clarence Otis","Yes, we don't want to get into the analysis. But as we look at comparable REITs, certainly you have to discount for the fact that there's very little -- no diversification, really, in a Darden REIT, and the debt breakage costs are hundreds of millions of dollars.","Operator","Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I want to go back to the cost savings initiatives you have and how we should think about that $60 million number. And should we think about that as a maximum number of cost savings that you're willing to take out of the business before being concerned you would negatively impact the guest experience, I guess, is the first part of that. And secondly, can you address the additional field personnel that you explained the need for at the most recent Analyst Day and then how you're thinking about that right now?","Clarence Otis","Yes, I would say a couple of things. One is that we don't think of it as a maximum, actually. We think there's opportunity. We'll be working hard against those opportunities through the separation process and afterwards. And it really is about being more cost efficient in the support areas that are not those areas where we're making -- we have made significant investments. So we have invested in some new capabilities in order to broaden our reach, digital capabilities, marketing capabilities. But the support cost away from that is where we're taking a very hard look and we think there's more opportunity. What I'd say just as a final piece is in terms of the new capabilities, we don't think that there is incremental investment that needs to be made. We've gotten where we need to be. And so at this point, it really is about getting the benefit of those additional capabilities.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, and your question on the field capabilities we've added, we have relooked at that and continue to modify the operations structure to become a little bit more efficient. But we are pleased with where we are operationally at this point from a structure standpoint.","Clarence Otis","And I would say the last thing is as we look out, some of the new marketing and digital capabilities that we've added, really our designed to enable us to have much more robust one-on-one conversations with guests. And as those scale up, we would expect our television marketing expenses to scale down dramatically. And so it is an upfront investment in really trying to meaningfully improve the business model down the road.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Hessler of Bank of America.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I realize not everything is set in stone at this point. I mean, are there any sort of qualitative comments that you can offer on Red Lobster's going to be a high-yield, mature brand? What do you think is the appropriate amount of debt and leverage might be at that entity? I'm just trying to figure out how that entity might be capitalized once you execute on these plans? And then I have one follow-up.","Clarence Otis","There's still a lot to be determined there as we work through this, but I would start with the new Darden piece. The importance of this investment-grade credit profile there, work very hard to maintain that and be in a position to continue that going forward. On the Red Lobster piece, as you've seen, barring a bit of near-term headwinds, its annual cash flows are quite substantial. They're pretty durable. And as we look at it, it's not going to have a need to fund growth. Its CapEx will be greatly reduced. And so it will have a debt load that probably positions it below investment-grade profile. So we're looking at it right now but not dramatically below that. And so still more to come on that. But that's how we view it as we look at it today.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then have you thought at all about how you plan to sort of monetize that spinoff? I think Red Lobster's been in the portfolios for quite a long time, maybe since the '70s or so. So I would imagine that the tax basis there is relatively low. And in that case, if you want to monetize it, would you have to do something like a debt exchange? I mean, I'm not sure how much you guys have thought through the details there or what you're willing to share today, but I think a debt exchange often allows you to monetize the asset in excess of the basis. So any comments that you would have there?","Clarence Otis","Yes, you're getting quite detailed and quite technical. But yes, we have reviewed those. We've been well advised, and we are looking at exploring those options to make sure that we maximize shareholder value through this transaction. I'd say just stepping back a little bit from some of the finer points is we do expect this to be a tax-free exchange transaction for our shareholders, and we will take advantage of whatever planning opportunities are there to minimize debt cost, debt load for Red Lobster and make sure that we get the greatest shareholder value out of the opportunity as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of questions as well. First, I'm just wondering, on the real estate side of things, you addressed the -- your concern around the REIT. I'm just wondering whether there was a sale leaseback considered at all or whether or not you can walk us through why might that not work. Separately, the second question, I was just wondering on Red Lobster -- or actually, Olive Garden as well, whether you consider holding Red Lobster and\/or franchising either one of the brands. I know that's been talked about as maybe an option, especially for Red Lobster. It's such a mature brand and fundamentals have been slowing. And then lastly, I'm just wondering why maybe LongHorn unit growth is being slowed. It seems like we're only halfway their maturity and the performance is strong. Just wondering whether it's something to do with the real estate or what might keep you from -- or why slow down at LongHorn growth.","Clarence Otis","Yes. And I'll start with the last 2. And so at LongHorn, it was very important for us to get to a scale where we could have national cable advertising, and we reached that scale. And to get to that scale, as you think about the balance between the pace of expansion and talent pipeline, we'll lean into expansion and take a little bit more risk on talent pipeline. Now that we're there, we feel like we don't have to take that risk on talent pipeline. So we want to be at a pace that really enables us to be pretty confident as we put the management teams in place, and we're there. In addition, as we said, we think that in the environment we're in, return of capital to shareholders is a more important value creation lever. And we like to improve our credit metrics, and slowing growth at LongHorn contributes to both of those. In terms of franchising, when we looked at the Olive Garden and the returns at Olive Garden, we like to own 100% of that return. I mean, it's the highest returning brand in our portfolio. Essentially, Olive Garden and Capital Grille, the 2 of them have the highest returns. And so we don't really see a whole lot of value creation in giving those returns to shareholders -- to franchisees. Red Lobster has a different return profile. It's got more variability in returns within its portfolio, and so franchising is something I'm sure that Brad and Kim will take a pretty hard look at.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes. And well, let me just add one comment to Clarence's on the LongHorn pace. You've heard us talk about reaching national cable media. This is the first year now that they have that through all of their promotional cycles. And so that's why the timing of this one works out where it does. Like you said, it's the balance that we need given where we are in terms of unit growth and talent pipelines. On the sale leaseback, as Clarence mentioned earlier on, we have an ongoing discipline of looking and reviewing for strategic opportunities. And we've always seen in the past that sale-leaseback opportunities, given where Darden was and our access to lower-costing public company debt given our credit profile, they just haven't made sense. As a part of this review, we went back and looked at that again. And really, it hasn't changed a lot, and so it still doesn't make sense for us at this point. Like I said, it's a new opportunity for Red Lobster. We're going to review that even more in depth down the road, but nothing I would expect immediately. And we didn't see things that made sense. So it's not something that's high on our list right now. But we're always out there looking. And if conditions were to change, we would not hesitate to look at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to a comment you made around your overall leverage being flat to modestly improved at Darden. Just given sort of the shrinkage in the existing profile of new Darden, how much flexibility will you have to, let's say, actually decrease debt more if necessary, potentially flexing some of the share repurchase you're looking to do in order to maintain the rating?","Clarence Otis","Yes. I would point to 2 things real quickly. And that is around the reduced CapEx. We talked about a range of $100 million, maybe even a little bit above that. And so that provides a fair amount of flexibility. And as you've seen in this year's financial results, the second quarter, the operating CapEx, even in a tough environment like this, continues to grow and improve above prior years. So we've seen a couple of big levers to continue to improve operating cash flows outside of -- or excuse me, total cash flow outside of just the straight operating performance that we have.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then as we think about, I guess, just the Red Lobster piece, if we were to explore a sale, would sort of the use of proceeds, I guess, be consistent with some of your thoughts around separation?","Clarence Otis","Yes. We would look at that, and you'd see that greatly go to reducing debt, as well as the balance of that as return to our shareholders.

But we do know we need to work on both sides of the debt profile but also maintain a strong return to equity holders as well.","Matthew Stroud","That's all the time we have this morning for questions.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you, you may begin.","Kevin Kalicak","Thank you, Gene. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO, and Rick Cardenas, CFO.","As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company\u2019s press release which was distributed this morning and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings on March 22nd before the market opens, followed by a conference call.","This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights, Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from the first quarter, and then Gene will have some closing remarks before we open the call for your questions. During today\u2019s call and for the remainder of this fiscal year, all references to Darden\u2019s same restaurant sales only include Darden\u2019s legacy brands since Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen Restaurants are new to Darden.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. Let me start by saying I\u2019m very pleased of our performance during the quarter. Our teams did a great job managing through some difficult circumstances recovering from the hurricanes.","Total sales from continued operations were 1.88 billion, an increase of 14.6%. Same restaurant sales grew 3.1% and adjusted net earnings per share were $0.73, an increase of 14.1% from last year\u2019s diluted net earnings per share. ","Given our consistent positive results, I\u2019m more convinced than ever that our success has been driven by the strategy we implemented three years ago. Our intense focus on improving the food, service and atmosphere in our restaurants combined with relevant integrated marketing remains a winning strategy for our brands.","The long-term investments we have made and will continue to make and these areas are paying-off and we will work hard every day to better execute in these critical areas. This back-to-basics operating philosophy is coupled with Darden\u2019s four competitive advantages; one, leveraging our significant scale to create a cost advantage, two, using extensive data insights to improve operating fundamentals and to better understand our guests and communicate with them more effectively, ensuring our brands systematically go through our rigorous strategic planning process, and four, cultivating our results oriented people culture to enable growth. Together our operating philosophy and competitive advantages give me confidence in our ability to continue to deliver our long-term framework overtime.","Turning to Olive Garden. Same-restaurant sales grew 3% outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 400 basis points. This was Olive Garden\u2019s 13th consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth driven by our focus on simplification and flawless execution, which continues to result in high guest satisfaction scores. Our promotional strategies and core menu are working together to create everyday value, and drive increased frequency for our most loyal guests and our strong-to-go performance which grew 12%. ","During the quarter, we ran our two most popular value promotions, Buy One Take One, which appeals to our guest need for convenience and Never Ending Pasta Bowl which highlights our brand pillar of never ending abundance. Both promotions leveraged brand equities and were supported by strong integrated marketing campaigns highlighted by Olive Garden\u2019s most anticipated event of the year The Pasta Pass. This year in addition to making 22,000 pasta passes available we introduced the first of its kind Pasta Passport which included all the benefits of the Pasta Pass plus a trip of a lifetime to Italy. Once again, all pasta passes were claimed online immediately. The volume of social media and PR buzz surrounding this event illustrates the strong emotional connection our fans have with the Olive Garden.","LongHorn Steakhouse had strong quarter as the investments we have been making for last two years are significantly improving consumer perceptions and motivating guests to visit more frequently. Same restaurant sales grew 3.8%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 480 points. This was LongHorn\u2019s 19th consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth. The emphasis LongHorn\u2019s leadership has placed on simplification like reducing their menu items by nearly 30% has led to higher levels of execution. At the same time, they continue to enhance the quality of guest experience with strategic investments in food, service and atmosphere. ","As I mentioned last quarter same restaurant sales at LongHorn\u2019s new markets continue to grow at a higher rate than in the established markets. Consumers in these new markets are discovering what makes LongHorn special, while at the same time fully realizing the value proposition that inherently exists in the brand. This performance trend is not new to LongHorn. We have seen it play out over the past 20 years as I have been associated with the brand. ","Now I will update you on the Cheddar's integration. The Cheddar's team is doing a great job managing the complexity of this integration which also includes integrating the two largest franchisees which were recently acquired. Merging three different operating systems into the Darden network isn\u2019t easy but is going exactly as planned. ","We are at an important point in the integration progress as we transition from planning to execution. Integration related activity is peaking as we transition distribution networks including our main line distributor, produce suppliers and smallware suppliers, convert point of sales systems in 10 restaurants per week which also includes two weeks of training for restaurant prior to conversion, fully transition Cheddar's payroll system on to the Darden payroll platform and finally, we just completed open enrollment and Cheddar\u2019s team members will be transition to Darden benefits at the beginning of the calendar year. It is our intent to integrate Cheddar\u2019s and the two acquired franchise systems as fast as possible in order to position the brand to take advantage of the scale, synergies another benefits of Darden infrastructure. ","We realize this is having a short-term negative impact on sales momentum, but we believe the long-term benefit will far outweigh the short-term impact. Rick will provide an update on synergies in his remarks in just a moment. I want to thank the integration team for this outstanding work on this project. They have developed a comprehensive plan and are executing that plan at high levels. The more we learn about Cheddar\u2019s the more excited we become of the long-term growth prospects. They are the undisputed value leader in casual dining with a large loyal guest base and average approximately 6,300 guests per week, per restaurant.","Let me close by saying the holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they help our guests celebrate with co-workers family and friends. On behalf of our management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our 175,000 team members for all due to create memorable guest experiences during the special time of the year. We remain focused on getting better every day and I look forward to making even more progress in the new year ahead. ","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Rick. ","Rick Cardenas","Thank you, Gene, and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter with total sales grew of 14.6% driven by 11.5% growth from the addition of 153 Cheddar\u2019s and 28 other new restaurants and same restaurant sales growth of 3.1%. Second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.73, an increase of 14.1% from last year\u2019s earnings per share. We paid $78 million in dividends and repurchase $89 million in shares. In total, we returned approximately $167 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter and 346 million fiscal year-to-date. ","Turning to this quarter\u2019s P&L. Restaurant level EBITDA margin was 20 basis points higher than last year as cost savings and leverage from same restaurant sales growth more than offset overall inflation pressure and the addition of Cheddar\u2019s, which I will refer to as brand mix. Adjusted EBIT margin was flat as G&A expense as a percent of sales was 20 basis points higher than last year due to an unfavorable outcome in a legal matter this quarter. Excluding this matter, G&A would have been favorable by 10 basis points. This unfavorability in G&A was completely offset in income taxes due to the resolution of certain prior year matters. ","So, for the quarter, our adjusted EBIT margin increased 10 basis points versus last year. Looking more closely at the details. Food and beverage costs were favorable by 20 basis points as pricing of approximately 1.5% and costs savings more than offset commodity cost inflation of just under 1% and our continued investments in food quality. Restaurant labor was unfavorable by 30 basis points compared to last year due to Cheddar\u2019s brand mix. Restaurant labor in our legacy Darden brands was in line with last year due to continued productivity gains and sales leverage despite inflation of about 4%. ","We opened more restaurants this quarter than the same period last year, which increased our pre-opening expenses. As a result, restaurant expense as a percent of sales was unfavorable 10 basis points versus last year.","Marketing expense was favorable by 40 basis points due to sales leverage and favorable brand mix from Cheddar. ","Finally, G&A expense was unfavorable by 20 basis points due to the legal outcome I mentioned previously. ","Olive Garden, Longhorn and Fine Dining segment all grew sales in the quarter driven primarily by strong same restaurant sales. Segment profit margin increased in each of these segments by leveraging the same restaurant sales growth and managing cost effectively while still investing in a great guest experience. ","Looking at the other business segment, sales grew 71.7% mainly due to the addition of Cheddar\u2019s as well as same restaurant sales growth at Yardhouse and Bahama Breeze. Similar to last quarter, segment profit margin was 200 basis points lower than last year due to the brand mix impact of adding Cheddar\u2019s and for moving consumer packaged goods out of this segment primarily to Oliver Garden. ","Turning to the Cheddar synergy update. We continue to expect total run-rate synergies of between $22 million and $27 million. Based on the speed of integration and the great job our teams are doing to realize these synergies, we expect to achieve them a little faster than we originally anticipated. We now project to realize just under $10 million in synergies in the current fiscal year and achieve our targeted run-rate no later than the middle of fiscal 2019 instead of the end of fiscal 2019. ","And finally, this morning we increased our full year fiscal 2018 outlook. We now anticipate same restaurant sales growth of approximately 2%, new restaurant growth of approximately 40% and total sales growth of approximately 13%, each of these are at the high end of our original annual outlook. ","Our full year adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations are now anticipated to between $4.45 and $4.53. This is an increase from our previous outlook of $4.38 to $4.50. We are anticipating an effective tax rate of approximately 25% and a diluted average share count of approximately 126 million shares outstanding for the year. Please note, this outlook does not contemplate any potential impacts from the pending tax legislation. ","Based on the information we know today, we anticipate that the tax legislation will have a benefit to us in terms of our effect tax rate going forward. Also, in the quarter the bill is enacted we are required to revalue our deferred taxes. Since the bill has not received final approval there are still many details to be analyze and we will reserve comment on the specific impacts to our tax rate overall. ","Given the complexity of the pending legislation, we will not be providing any other detail in the Q&A session. Again, neither the expected reduction to our effective tax rate nor the onetime differed tax adjustments are included in the outlook we have updated today. We plan to update our fiscal 2018 outlook in early January to reflect the impact of tax legislation. ","In closing I want to wish you all a great holiday season. And hope you will celebrate with family and friends in one of our restaurants. And with that we\u2019ll take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brett Levy ","Good morning and thank you. Can you share a little bit of color on what you\u2019re seeing across the competitive landscape? Obviously, you\u2019re still generating significant market share gains but the rate of growth seems to have slowed a little. Where are you seeing pockets of -- I\u2019d have to use the word weakness and also just one quick question on tax. I know you said you won\u2019t say much but are you under the impression that there will be no change to tip credit and how it would impact casual diners? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Brett as Rick said, we are making no further comments on the pending tax legislation. We will update our guidance in January once the bill is passed. So, for everybody else who wants to ask as a question on it, we\u2019re not going to answer them. ","As far as the consumer landscape, I think you were referring to that our GAP to NAV or our GAAP to benchmarks may have shrunk a little bit and we\u2019ve been pretty clear and we said we preferred to operate in an environment with a stronger industry and if our GAAP shrinks a little bit, that\u2019s okay with us. ","As I said in my prepared remarks, I think we had a great quarter considering everything that transpired, we saw strength in all our businesses, we started in a pretty big hole in September. I think it feels pretty good out there. I would say when I look at the benchmarks, I\u2019m seeing about 3% growth in what the consumer is paying. So, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s still the environment all that promotional right now. I know they could be getting that in a couple of different ways where they\u2019re getting it through price or mix. But I feel like it\u2019s fairly positive out there right now and I just feel good. I think the consumer is using the whole menu, they\u2019re not all that reactive to what people are doing from an incentive standpoint. So, it feels good.","Brett Levy ","And then just one follow-up, your guidance rates on both the topline and the comp, is that implying just to what we\u2019ve achieved in the first half of the year or is there something that you are seeing in the second half that\u2019s giving you greater confidence? Thank you. ","Rick Cardenas","Hey Brett its Rick. The guidance implies what we know in this in for the first half of the year and just some estimates of the economy or the industry is not going to get much better. We don\u2019t assume that it\u2019s going to just get better until it\u2019s gets better. So, the guidance we\u2019ve given is prudent based on where we are today.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. ","David Palmer ","Thanks, and good morning. I\u2019m thinking ahead to calendar \u201918, I\u2019m struggling a bit to create an outlook for what the casual dining industry same store sales would look like for that year and obviously given the fact you have an empire that slices across various concepts and you can see how the consumer is behaving across the menu. ","This is an easier comparison quarter for the industry than what will have perhaps coming up. Do you feel like this is a sustainable improvement that\u2019s going on lately and is there any key leaves that you can see in terms of behavior that gives you confidence that there is an improvement going on even before tax reform? Thanks.","Gene Lee ","Hey good morning David. I continue to see -- when I look over the landscape the brands that are well positioned have strong value equations are continuing to take share. This is approximately $100 billion category that has been growing approximately 2%. And for those that are well positioned, I feel like they are going to continuing to do well. If your value propositions are little off and your offering is not resonating with the consumer, it could be a struggle. I think focusing on the overall industry benchmarks is somewhat dangerous because it\u2019s been such deviation in the performance of the people that are doing well compared to the people who aren\u2019t. So, I can\u2019t comment and give you guidance on what we think calendar \u201818 might look like. We\u2019ve given you what we think guidance is for the back half of our fiscal year, we always get a little nervous in December, January, February and March because weather is out of our control. We can\u2019t control that. And if we have a bad winter, that could put pressure short-term on our same restaurant sales. But we don\u2019t think that has any impact on the overall momentum of the business.","So, as I said earlier to Brett\u2019s question, we feel pretty good about how the consumer is reacting to our brands right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","John Glass","Thanks very much. Rick, may be first, can you just may be split the guidance to your previous expectations, you raised sales expectations for both units and for comps and you raised earnings but it would seem like tax and share count were responsible for that but you\u2019re also observing some hurricane impacts. So, what -- are those the right puts and takes or how do you -- is there anything else that moves for example in G&A or something that is not explained by that? ","Rick Cardenas","Yes, John a couple of things. One, as I said earlier we did have a little bit of a legal settlement that we had this quarter, not settlement but an outcome that we had this quarter that we didn\u2019t anticipate. We also -- as we talk about the G&A -- no I am sorry -- G&A cost of sales in food and beverage, we are still saying that our cost inflation in total is going to about 2% when you include labor. But every tenth of that move is about $0.03 a share. So, we\u2019re still saying approximately 2%, it\u2019s just closer to the 2%, right at the 2% than may be a little bit lower than the 2%. And also, we are going to continue invest in our consumer and invest in value. So, as we have said before if we do get some incremental revenues, we may have some of that that we hold back and invest in our consumer for the long-term. So that\u2019s why we still believe that the high end of our range at $4.53 is the right place to be, even though we did increase our sales and we did have a little bit of benefit in tax which was offset in legal.","John Glass","And you last quarter talked about being conservative in pricing in the middle of the 1% to 2% range, you\u2019ve been a little bit higher than that at Olive Garden may be at but may be slightly above it, a little lower in LongHorn\u2019s. So, can you may be just update what your thoughts on pricing are, if the industry has bettered, do you feel like that gives you a little more license to be little higher in that range or do you still want to maintain that lower than competitors\u2019 value proposition?","Rick Cardenas","Yes, a couple of things. One is, our long-term framework and algorithm, as always said -- in our strategy of leveraging Darden\u2019s cost advantage, we\u2019ve always said that we want to price below our competition which generally prices that inflation.","Even if inflation goes up and competitors start to price, we believe that somewhere in that middle of between the 1% and 2% is the right place to be. And Olive Garden you mentioned, I think it was a 1.7 [ph] this quarter, Longhorn is below 1% this quarter. Even though, our commodity cost inflation was 1%. Olive Garden had much more inflation than Longhorn, because of Dairy [ph]. So, as we think about Olive Garden over the year, it\u2019s also a timing thing. We still think Olive Garden will be about 1.5 for the year and Longhorn will be below that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. ","Nicole Miller ","First question. Could the industry be benefiting from a sale and could that be a permanent benefit as we enter the calendar year? And then specific on that point to Darden. When you look at what you\u2019re doing in test [ph] how do you look at the price point breaks and what should be out-source and in-source. For example, if you get over $100 or maybe $200 or $300. Is that something you\u2019re still in sourcing and when you outsource there is a lot of delivery test place, a lot of marketplaces you are testing. So how you\u2019re starting, who\u2019d go to and when? Thanks.","Gene Lee","A lot in there Nicole. Let me start with the off-price sales. I take back to where, we identified a couple of years ago that the consumer needs data of convenience. The consumers are still looking at that for convenience. We\u2019ve got some brands that really can satisfy that express the Olive Garden. We\u2019ve done a great job with that. I think that\u2019s probably, a more permanent part of our equation today. I don\u2019t see that need state going away, I see that need state increasing. And I think we\u2019ll continue to come up with innovative way to meet that need. As far as, we start thinking about delivery and as we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019ve got multiple tests going on in the marketplace, we are trying to learn.","We believe that someone is going to rise up and create some scale in the space and we\u2019ll watch those third-party delivers. We\u2019re also watching competitors that are doing it themselves. We have a small test, we\u2019re doing ourselves. And we\u2019ll watches whole space kind of develop. And we\u2019ll decide, how we\u2019re going to participate in that. We are still very attracted to the large party delivery catering in Olive Garden where average order is over $300. That makes a lot more sense for us to market and pursue than running around delivering $10 entrees at this point in time. So, for us, it\u2019s a wait and see. We\u2019re very engaged in the process, where all the third-party delivery companies and we\u2019re very engaged with our own activity around that. So, to us, so what see how these things develops. ","Nicole Miller ","And just a quick follow-up on a separate topic. I believe, I saw Olive Garden recently showed up as one of Glassdoor's ranked best employers. And what I want to understand, is that a function of the return to basic strategy, there are topics that you have in place now or is there even more to come? Thanks.","Gene Lee","We have a filter that we run every decision through. And the first question we ask is how does our team member win if we make a decision. The second is how does our guest win if we make a decision and we believe one of our four competitive advantages is our culture even as the employee market has tightened, our retention rates have not moved it all, they actually improved a little bit. We\u2019ll continue to invest in our team members, we believe we have great training programs, 50% of our management comes from our team member ranks which we believe are offering growth opportunities to our team members. And I think we\u2019re doing the right thing, we\u2019re not trying to manage to when these awards were \u2013 we\u2019re just doing the right thing for our team members every single day and then if we then get an award that\u2019s great. But I think you can see it in our results, we\u2019re doing a good job taken care of our guests and we take care of our guests, we win. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Your line is now open. ","Will Slabaugh","Yeah. Thanks, guys. Want to ask about Cheddar's and other lot of moving pieces there as you integrate to business, but can you talk a bit about positioning with such a valued end to concept probably a little bit more than the rest of your concepts. Does that leave it more vulnerable to improve quality and\/or better value messaging from QSR or fast casual? Or do you think we are simply just seeing the pure dislocation of integration that you mentioned earlier?","Gene Lee","No, I don\u2019t think, I think the exact opposite. I think this is a way for people to trade in the casual dining and having an experience for under $14 -- under a $14 check average was made from scratch food that is at a higher quality than most comparable operations they are competing against. ","We look at the data and the research, we\u2019re just really impressed with the loyalty, we\u2019ve been out doing what we call dine arounds, where our team goes out and dine with guest. And we continue to learn more and more about the admiration they have for our brand. And the accessibility the brand provides for people who probably couldn\u2019t go out to eat in a full service casual dining environment except they can go to Cheddars and make it work inside their budget. This is a very strong brand, when I think about -- I know there is a little bit of concern about where the comps are and this doesn\u2019t surprise us at all, it happened at Yardhouse, it happened at Longhorn and I believe the only -- Longhorn only ever had one negative full year of same restaurant sales decline and that was during the integration in its 30 some year history. ","The other thing I would add is that, we\u2019ve acquired two large franchise operations inside of Cheddar's that make up approximately 35% of the system. Those restaurants, there are 54 of them I believe or approximately 54 are a significant drag on the base Cheddar restaurants that were the real base of the company owned operations that we bought. Those restaurants are dragging it down, well over percent. As we standardize the menus, because the menus were somewhat different and their pricing philosophies were somewhat different, as we\u2019ve standardize the menus we are getting some negative check, that\u2019s drag and it sound to. These are decisions we have to make for a long-term. ","And lastly as I mentioned in my remarks, integration is hard and we believe, when we look back on our couple of our last acquisitions, we didn\u2019t go fast enough, we let integration drag on too long. And so, we made the determination during this fund that we\u2019re going push hard and get to the other side quicker and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing and we actually integrated the two franchise systems first, so they\u2019ve actually had the most activity because their systems were so weak. ","And I will close up by just saying the most important thing for us to do is to get our POS systems in these restaurants so that we can start getting the data that we get to analyze our other businesses to help us make the right strategic choices as we move forward to drive this brand.","Let\u2019s not get hung up on short term quarter-to-quarter comps, this business does 6,300 guests a week, has incredible loyalty and is the undisputed value leader. Once we get to the other side of this which will be another 6, 9, 12 months, this business will be a good growth driver for Darden.","Will Slabaugh","Got it. And one quick follow up if I could on the off-premise question from earlier, did you give what Olive Darden growth was in the quarter?","Gene Lee","12%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Brian Bittner ","Hey guys thanks and happy holidays to you. As you start to think about 2019 just the synergies from the accretion are significant and they are accretive. What\u2019s going to be the strategy with that extra money as you think about it today? Is there something that you\u2019re going to let flow through the P&L and be accretive or is this something where you\u2019re looking to possibly reinvest it back in the price or value?","Gene Lee","Yeah, I think Brian, every year we start off with a detailed plan for each of our business. The first thing that we look at it is what investments do we even make into the business, either through employee, experience into the guest and already be able to grow our market share and compete more effectively. ","We look at our advantages and we\u2019ve always come back to that and how do we make scale work for us and that\u2019s really, really important and so we\u2019re not really talking about next year or next fiscal year but we\u2019re constantly looking at how do we make our experience better?","Brian Bittner ","Thanks for that Gene and just following up with a lot of the other questions, I mean you have always said throughout the last couple of years and at least conversations with me for sure that when industry trends do pick up that we should all expect your outperformance gap to narrow, but it didn\u2019t narrow much and you\u2019re clearly participating in this improvement that the industry is seeing. So, I mean I\u2019m just trying to -- I just like to kind of get your thoughts on that because on one side it does appear you\u2019re benefitting with the rest of the industry with the Olive Garden brand but on the other token I feel like you kind of want to, kind of expect the gap to narrow versus the industry as the trend remains the sustainably healthy. So, can you just maybe talk a little more to that, I appreciate it?","Gene Lee","I mean you\u2019re really asking me to look into a crystal ball and try to project what\u2019s happening, I mean what\u2019s going to happen. We think our advantages and if we continue to make the right investments, whether it\u2019s underpricing and inflation, whether that\u2019s improving the food quality, whether that\u2019s improving the employee experience. The way we look at it how do we increase our share of the $100 billion category, both through same restaurant sales growth and new restaurant growth. And we look at the value equation for each of our businesses and we look at Cheddar's and Olive garden. The price value relationship is really important, as we move up the continuing [ph] the we experience becomes more important. ","So, I am not sure -- if the overall industry does continue to improve, I\u2019m telling you right now, we\u2019re working as hard as we possibly can to get as much of that share as possible. And however, it plays out, it plays out. But we are not all that -- we look at the benchmarks, we report them out to you guys, but we are not sure that\u2019s always the total opportunity because we look at the top five or six players in the industry and say if they\u2019re doing something that we ought to try to be able to beat them not just the benchmark.","Operator","The next question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Your line is now open.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. Gene, may be a high level philosophical question about the tax reform. I know you don\u2019t want to give specifics on the impact. But it does look pretty likely that you are going to see a meaningful benefit from that. So how do you think about reinvestments when it comes to the potential benefit you might get from tax reform? You talked about a lot of reinvestment so far. But is there -- are there big opportunities or being chunks of investments you think are out there that you might pursue if you get a big windfall from factors?","Gene Lee","Well, I think the biggest thing that we constantly think about is the employee experience and how do we ensure that we have the best team members out there to bring our brands alive. Great brand management is much more difficult in the restaurant space than it is in consumer-packaged goods where you just put your brand up on a shelf and you do some advertising. We have employees that -- team members that bring our brands to life every single day. So, when I think about the investment -- if we think about investments in general, they have nothing to do with what\u2019s going on with legislation. We think about how do we improve the overall experience? And the competition for team members I think is going to be the most important element moving forward. How do we get great team members to bring our brands to life?","David Tarantino","I guess -- just so I can you clarify, if you do get a benefit or a windfall from the tax reform, do you think there are meaningful offsets to that or -- in this investment cycle or can you embed those investments in what you\u2019re already doing? I just want to understand kind of philosophically how you look at savings?","Gene Lee","I mean we are not going to talk about anything that has -- you tie this to meaningful benefits of tax reform, we\u2019re not talking about anything I am sorry David, about tax reform. We will talk about general investments and how we think about it but I think I\u2019ve already answered that question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is now open.","Peter Saleh ","Great, thanks. Just wanted to ask, on wage inflation it sounds like your wage or labor inflation is running around 4%, yet you only have some modest deleverage on the labor line. Can you talk a little bit about the productivity gains that you are seeing, what brands are you seeing these productivity gains and what kind of gains are they -- are they going to be going or should we expect those to lessen as we get through the end of the year?","Rick Cardenas","Yes, it\u2019s Rick. We are seeing productivity gains across the Darden system. I\u2019m not going to tell you by brand how much productivity, we\u2019re getting. Although, if you think about what we\u2019ve been doing over the last few years, we continue to simplify our operations and the brands that are simplifying are getting the most productivity gains. ","And also, as I mentioned earlier, we did have some same restaurant sales leverage that helped. And finally, our turnover really hasn\u2019t moved much. As you think about turnover what happens when you have turnovers, you have to train a lot more. What we\u2019re doing with our training dollars is we\u2019re investing in training and getting our team members better at their job to become more productive than just learning their job, which is what happens when you\u2019re hiring new folks. ","So, when you think about all of that, we feel really great about the productivity gains we\u2019ve made over the last few years. There are some brands that still have more To Go. Some brands that actually have actually been further along in the cycle. So, they might have a little less. But they\u2019re not stopping looking for productivity in the future. And you did mention, we did say that we had about 4% wage inflation, which is a pretty high inflation, but we were able to offset that with these productivity gains and with the moderate pricing we took. ","Peter Saleh ","And then just on the go [ph] side of the business. I think historically, you had a lot of, I guess phone-in orders for To Go. What do we stand say, I guess on phone-in versus online orders coming in. Are How you seeing more of that growth coming from online orders?","Gene Lee","Yes. We\u2019re approximately 30% online now and it continues to grow. And we do incentivize people to do that. Because we get a lot of data when they we get via online. And so, that\u2019s an important part of the process, it just helps to simplify the operation and we\u2019ll continue to try to migrate as much of that business over as possible. At the end of the day, we got a lot of people calling in orders, when they are driving home. That\u2019s hard to do those online, while you\u2019re driving. But we\u2019ll continue with more people over the best we can. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Matt, your line is now open.","Matt Kirschner","Just had a couple of follow-up questions here. I just want to be clear. Did you say them at the negative two at Cheddar\u2019s was of the full based including the franchise stores and was negative check, more than negative check, so traffic was positive?","Gene Lee","No. Let me clarify. Those negative two is inclusive of the two franchise systems that we -- what they call the Grier restaurants that were purchased by Cheddar\u2019s right before we bought them. And then we purchased their next largest franchisee, which we refer to as a CMP shortly thereafter. They make up 35% of the overall system. So, in essence, we\u2019re doing 3 integrations at once and their system has grown dramatically. Now what I said and maybe I wasn\u2019t clear, was that, the 35% of the restaurants that were franchised and now company owned are dragging same restaurant sales down by 100 basis points. And\u2026","Matt Kirschner","Were they in 1Q as well?","Gene Lee","Yes. CMP wasn\u2019t just a Grier restaurant. And we have negative check in the approximately 45 Grier restaurants that we brought, because we had to standardize the menu. So that negative check is part of the drag. And this franchise -- these are great restaurants, great people but our franchise system that was run a little bit independently of the core company owned restaurants. So, there is going to some effort and energy to get them up to the operating standards of the company restaurants. ","Matt Kirschner","Completely understand. So, it wouldn\u2019t be correct to compare it down 1.4 to down 2 and you had a little bit of a different composite of the base?","Gene Lee","Yes, that would be correct. You could do that. ","Matt Kirschner","Okay.","Gene Lee","Because the CMP restaurants are a drag.","Matt Kirschner","And then you mentioned that the middle of FY 2019, is now the target -- ahead of schedule for the integration correct?","Gene Lee","Yes. Yeah, it is fiscal 2019. Sorry, Matt it\u2019s for the synergies not the integration. So, the integration, we expect to have most of the integration work done on the system side by the end of this fiscal year, but we do expect them to have to continue to learn how those systems works and then take those systems and use the data that we have to help improve the performance in fiscal 2019 that\u2019s fair. That\u2019s where I think we were saying the integration is going to take 18 months, it\u2019s the integration, the system is going to take less time than that, it\u2019s just the learning and the understanding the data is going to take a little longer. But we do expect that the synergies on a run-rate basis, we will get by the middle of fiscal 2019 versus the run-rate basis we thought will be at the end of fiscal 2019. So, sorry messed up the question there.","Matt Kirschner","So, I guess if everything is moving forward, would it be correct to assume that potentially you could be looking to reaccelerate growth of the Cheddar\u2019s brand or bring it back to a little bit more meaningful growth perhaps sooner than maybe what you would have thought say six months ago?","Gene Lee","Yeah. Matt, just because the integration is going a little bit faster, it\u2019s still takes time to find sites and other things and when you\u2019ve got a site pipeline that could be 18 months, it will take us a little longer just to rebuild that pipeline. We do expect to open restaurants in FY 2019, and we\u2019ll talk about the number of openings et cetera when we give you the fiscal 2019 outlook. But it\u2019s just going to take us a little while to build up that pipeline. Again, using the data that we use to help find the greater site. So, I would still expect us to open restaurants at least at the pace that we\u2019re opening them today in fiscal 2019, but we\u2019ll tell you more about that when we talk in 2019.","Matt Kirschner","Understood. And then last question, is there anything that you wanted tell us about the hurricanes as far as on the cost structure, did they impair, did you have any waste of food in the quarter that should be noted or called out that was meaningful to the margins or disparity in same store sales as far as recovering happening a little maybe regionally seeing a little bit of stronger strength in pockets. Or is it pretty much a -- or everything that you reported is sort of national trends?","Gene Lee","Yeah. Matt, thanks for that. What happened for the quarter, when we originally talked about the quarter we thought it would be down 60 basis points in the same restaurant sales and down $0.035 in - or $0.03 I\u2019m sorry in EPS. What it turned out was the restaurants that we had in Florida, impacted and they were closed for quite a while so that impacted us in total by about 50 basis points in close days. And those are higher volume restaurants in the system average. But then we did get some bounce back in Florida. And so, each brand was impacted differently, but for the company for Darden it was slightly negative in comps for the entire quarter. So, it wasn\u2019t negative 60 basis points, it\u2019s was just slightly negative. ","On an EPS basis, it turned out to be about $0.02 unfavorable instead of $0.03, because the comp impact wasn't as bad. Now, the $0.02 is primarily proactive things that we did to make sure that the restaurants were boarded up and so they were -- they didn\u2019t have any as much damage. We did have some food inventory write-off, we had some restaurants that were closed maybe a week and so that food has to be written-off. But we\u2019re also very proactive before the hurricanes come to help mitigate any food write-off. So again, it was about $0.02 for the quarter instead of three and it was about slightly negative in comp instead of 0.6. ","Operator","The next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Sara Senatore ","Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups if I could. First on the 12% growth instead of same as that quarter. I was wondering if that\u2019s signaled the outcome of what the steady state pace of growth might be or if you have any sense of where you think To Go mix might max out overtime. That\u2019s the first question. ","And then I wanted to ask about LongHorn and the SKU reduction that you were talking about, I guess I hadn\u2019t recognized that it was 30% reduction in menu items. You know sometimes we see that at club [ph] restaurants and it has a negative impact on comps that doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s been the case. So maybe you can talk about where those menus came out and what do you think the key is to sort of reducing the menu size without impacting traffic? Thanks.","Gene Lee","Alright. So, let\u2019s start with Olive Garden, the 12% quarter I thought was I think is a really strong To Go quarter. We think about the future; the consumer need state is going to continue -- is going to need to continue to increase for the convenience for us to continue to growth that. We\u2019re doing well over $0.5 million on average inside an Olive Garden box and To Go we\u2019ve got restaurants that are doing well over $1 million To Go. So, as we think about going in into the future, you know we need consumer needs state to continue to grow. We\u2019ll continue to innovative. I think one of the biggest things we can do on Olive Garden to Go is improve our operations as the business has improved, Dave and Dan and the team continue to work on coming up with better systems to handle the volume. ","It's actually an interesting business because I do a lot of pickups like at 11:15 and 11:30. And so they can use the [indiscernible] before it fills up to handle the volume. So, I think there is some operational improvements that we can make. We can continue to improve the offering to stay relevant to the guest and continue to remind the guest that its available. We have said -- we\u2019re publicly on the record saying that we think overtime if the consumer need state continues to grow that this can be 20% of our business. ","Primarily because the type of food travels so well and we can do it more so than just entrees that we can do bulk and bulk is where we want to be. ","Let me move to LongHorn, we\u2019ve been making great investments in LongHorn for the last two years, Todd and his team has done a great job of -- we\u2019ve increased the size of the stakes, we\u2019ve removed complexity in the kitchen and as we\u2019ve mentioned we\u2019ve taken the SKUs down, some of that through the menu, some of that through the promotional activity that we\u2019ve done, reducing the number of new items that we introduced on a quarterly basis. And what we\u2019re finding is we had a lot of stuff on menu items on our menu that really were duplicative and what the feeling -- the need they were feeling for the consumer, and we removed them and it just helps us operate much more efficiently. ","I believe all our businesses, all our brands, our menus are too complicated, too complex, we have items that continue to work and do the same thing over and over and over again versus having one great fried appetizer instead of having three great fried appetizers. And the more we can simplify the operation, the better the execution gets, the quality increases and the overall value the consumer is having an impact. ","And LongHorn historically has been a high food cost low labor cost operation. And we have simplified that operation to be able to bring the labor cost down and increase the productivity while improving the overall quality of the food product. And even as much as we\u2019ve reduced it already, I think there\u2019s still further reduction to be done in the LongHorn menu to improve the -- to simplify the operation. Those are very small kitchens that have to stay simple in order to cook the great steaks in a timely manner.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Chris O'Cull","Thanks. Good morning guys. Gene, how do you ensure that all the changes that are occurring at Cheddar's do not create a difficult work environment for employees and it could eventually impact the guest experience?","Gene Lee","That\u2019s fairly easy. The systems having been invested in, in those restaurants, they are working on very old POS systems and so big difference in this integration than some of the others where the Cheddar's team is actually pulling from us to get this information in restaurant where some of our past integrations, there\u2019s been a little push back because they had good systems and we are just the changing systems to change the systems. Here our systems are superior. They want the systems as soon as they can get them and they have just been -- they have been great to work with. We believe overall the benefits package is going to be much stronger for those team members. We think there\u2019s a huge upside in Cheddar's in increasing their retention. Right now, their employee retentions are above the average of the industry and we believe that if we can take them from 120% team member turnover down to our norm of 70% it's going to have a huge impact on the overall operation. So, we believe and all indications are that they like the systems that we\u2019re bringing. Ian has done a great job working with his teams and talking about the systems that we are implementing and getting feedback. So, I think this is going to really enhance their performance overtime.","Chris O'Cull","So, you have not seen any changes to the guest satisfaction scores at Cheddar's with this process?","Gene Lee","No.","Chris O'Cull","Okay. And then just one last question clarifying the menu changes at LongHorn. You mentioned the reduction in SKUs. But in terms of consumer facing menu items or what the consumer would experience, what is the percent reduction that you\u2019ve taken on the menu or through promotional items?","Gene Lee","Yes, it's almost 30% and we\u2019ve got different tests out there and we\u2019ve got different products in different market. So, it\u2019s somewhere, it\u2019s approximately 25% to 30%. We\u2019ve done a really good job; the management is done a really good job there of getting back on our pathway. Delivering that brand in the consumer differently than how Olive Garden delivers their brand to the consumer. And it has a lot to do with the promotional cadence and new product introductions. ","Chris O'Cull","And my question was, has that going through enough purchase cycles, so you can see whether there has been a change to frequency of those guests at many reductions?","Gene Lee","Yes. We were definitely seeing an increase in frequency in LongHorn. We measured that every quarter with our tokens.","Operator","Next question comes from Jason West from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jason West","Just one given the upcoming holiday shift. Can you guys quantify how that impacted you last year or how you think it impacted the current quarter with the movement in holidays and any other shifts like [indiscernible]?","Gene Lee","Yes, Jason, the holiday impact is minimal versus last year. The holiday shift moving Christmas basically from a Sunday to a Monday, it\u2019s really not going to be much different than it was last year. ","Rick Cardenas","Let me just add though. There are key days in our fiscal third quarter that cannot be weather impacted or also have a major impact, could have an impact on the quarter. I mean, so we got New Year\u2019s leave and Valentine\u2019s Day, which are big, big days in our quarter and a major weather event that covers a large geographic area could have impact. ","Gene Lee","Yes. And last year's holiday shift was about 20 basis points unfavorable. So, it shouldn\u2019t be much different than this year. So pretty much flat this year. ","Jason West","And I know Gene, it\u2019s hard to get, what\u2019s going on with the consumer from month-to-month. But we have seen a decent pick-up in the industry in the last couple of months and I don\u2019t know if you had any thoughts what\u2019s driving that and overlapping some of the election cycle stuff from last year but I don\u2019t know if there is anything else that you have seen or do you see in your regional data that a lot it is driven by the hurricane bounce backs or is it look broader based? Thanks.","Gene Lee","The industry is fighting for consumers, their consumers discretionary dollars. And I\u2019ve said on this call before, we\u2019re not just fighting amongst ourselves, we\u2019re fighting for those dollars that have been spent in other places. I do think that overall, the industry is being a little more rationale. I think there has been some okay innovation and I think we\u2019re attracting consumers again. I don\u2019t think there is a macro trend out there that says that we\u2019re pushing people and I think the industry is doing a better job. ","Operator","The next question comes from Greg Francfort from Bank of America. Your line is now open. ","Gregory Francfort","I have two super quick questions. One is just on the 2% comp guide. Is that for the legacy brand, or is ex-Cheddar\u2019s or does that include Cheddar\u2019s. And my other one is for Gene. It seems like the high-end category specifically has had a pretty big improvement in the last couple of months and I think you definitely saw it in your businesses. What do you think is driving that and what is the reason for the improvement, particularly at the high-end steakhouse and also Eddie V's?","Rick Cardenas","The 2% comp is for the legacy Darden brands, as Kevin mentioned on the beginning of our call, anytime we talk about comps for this fiscal year it will exclude the Cheddar\u2019s restaurants. ","Gene Lee","Good observation on the high-end category because our high-end brands with the hurricanes travel really came to a halt and they were disproportionately impacted and they had -- they really came back strong both Cap Grille and Eddie V's. ","I would also say that Texas has not stopped being a drag. That business was for 18 months, we had pretty good presence in our high-end restaurants in Texas and that had really been a constant drag and that\u2019s kind of flipped for us now. And the Texas restaurants are doing better and not dragging so, on a high end the consumer, it feels really good out there, the consumers out there people are celebrating, I think our brands are very well positioned, Sean Martin is doing an incredible job leading Eddie Vs, and really maximizing those restaurants and put up a great number, very, very excited about that. And we\u2019re opening a few restaurants in Eddie Vs, which is really good growth for us. ","Operator","Next question comes from Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. ","Jeff Farmer","Thank you. I did hear you guys loud and clear on your reluctance to discuss tax reform, but just having quickly said that, should reform become a reality by the end of this week, by the end of this year. When would you guys expect to be able to share any form of assessment of what reform might means to your business. And specifically pointing to either ICR in January. Or is this the situation where we might have to wait till late March when your next reports to get some more details to what tax reforms could mean to your P&L and cash flow?","Gene Lee","Hi, Jeff. Yeah, we expect to analyze the bill when it\u2019s signed. We\u2019re beginning to analyze it now, but we expect to have the impact of tax reform in early January ahead of ICR.","Operator","Next question comes from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Your line is now open. ","Andy Barish","Hi, guys. You are bumping up pretty close to your $200 million buyback here in the first half. Just any thoughts or further comments on cash to shareholders, free cash usage?","Gene Lee","Yeah. Andy, we are as you said bumping up close to our high end of our long-term framework. And it's just that, as we\u2019ve said there are years that we could be above it, years where we can be below it. Right now, we have given you our share count for the year, which is 126 million shares. So, you could probably see that we don\u2019t anticipate buying a whole a lot right now. But we did last year go over our $200 million. So, as we think about our return of capital, we\u2019ll see what other uses we have for that capital and whether we\u2019re going to go ahead and buyback shares. But right now, we\u2019ve given you I guess the best indication of what our share count will be for the end of the year. Well, actually for the average for the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Karen Holthouse","Hi. We\u2019ve had a couple of quarters now of more positive commentary on comp trends in Longhorn outside of core markets. Also, you\u2019ve pretty strong profit growth there. How should we think about that tying into plans for unit growth? And you are sort of two years or 2.5 years out from a pretty proactive decision to pull back on unit growth. How far would you want to be in this process and maybe tying in simplification and what not before you would potentially really reaccelerate. ","Rick Cardenas","Hey Karen its Rick. In relation to LongHorn unit growth, a couple of years out, what we have talked about over the last few years is that our long-term framework for Darden is about you know 2 to 3%-unit growth, sales from the unit. I mean, some of that will come from LongHorn. We\u2019re very reluctant to talk about accelerating rapidly any one brand because we know that speed kills and we opened 40 LongHorns two years in a row and we\u2019re you know kind of catching up to that right now. So, as we think about LongHorn in the future, I think we\u2019ve talked this year is going to be in the teens, the high teens, numbers of openings. ","I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that getting way out of line from there, but we\u2019ll give you a little bit more about FY\u201919 in a few months or actually by the end of the June. But right now, we\u2019re looking at pipeline, we\u2019re looking at filling in sites and markets that we already have restaurants in. We think that\u2019s a really good strategy for LongHorn and then continuing to find new markets where we can generate a beachhead and grow from there.","Karen Holthouse","And then a question on guidance, if you look at the midpoint of EPS growth and then account for that legal settlement you saw this quarter. It would seem that pretax profit growth is decelerating from sort of high teens in the first half towards something that\u2019s more mid-teens in the second half despite what I would think would be more of a benefit from Cheddar synergies into the back half. What are the other drivers of that? Are there individual line items of inflation we should be focused on or just to think about that cadence?","Gene Lee","Couple of things, one is we\u2019re ramping on a really strong last half of last year as you think about growth and inflation as we said for the year is going to be 2%, around 2 and it's just slightly higher than where we had anticipated. It's still around 2 but slightly higher on to be around 2 range and before. But we still have you\u2019ve done the math, somewhere in the double-digit growth rates in the back half of the year. So, we don\u2019t -- while we consider that a deceleration, it's still above our long-term framework growth rate if you think about earnings after tax and our long-term framework we say 7 to 10% and that would still be above that. ","Operator","Next question comes from Howard Penney from Hedgeye Risk Management. Your line is now open.","Howard Penney","Hi and thank you so much for the questions, I have two if you don\u2019t mind. First one, you attributed your success at LongHorn through the smaller menu, increased execution and increased frequency. One of your largest competitors in the casual dining space Chili's is also deploying a similar strategy. I was wondering how you view that competitive dynamic as they go from down 7 to a plus 2% or 3% as a fairly good market share shift in casual dining. Thanks.","Gene Lee","Yeah, I think one thing about LongHorn, we\u2019re finetuning the menu as we pull it back. I think it\u2019s a little bit different than the competitor that you mentioned. You know we had a lot of menu items that really weren\u2019t working that hard for us and we\u2019re introducing a lot of new products on a quarterly or every six weeks basis that weren\u2019t working hard. And you\u2019re very familiar with LongHorn Howard and a great LongHorn experience is a forceful way in a hot baked potato with sour cream and real butter. So, as we simplify our operation, we\u2019re executing it at a higher level. We need to get the stakes cooked correctly, we need to get the food out faster and that\u2019s what simplification has done for us. And I am really not going to comment on our competitors\u2019 strategy.","Howard Penney","I just wish you had a LongHorn closer to where I live. My second -- and I am just trying to understand your hesitation towards delivery and some of the work that we\u2019ve seen on delivery suggest that the biggest opportunity of what consumers are seeing, they are using delivery for is a replacement from a meal at home. So that would obviously be very incremental to the casual dining industry. So, I detected a hesitation if I am wrong about that, you can correct me, but is it that you don\u2019t know who to go with delivery or you want to do it yourself or maybe you just don\u2019t see the opportunity as being that big? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Well I think the answer -- there\u2019s two parts to your answer, we don\u2019t know who we are going to partner with yet and number, I don\u2019t like the current economics of the partnership. And so, I am trying to understand -- we are trying to understand their profit model and we are trying to understand our profit model doing internally. And once we get a pretty good understanding of both those models and they are well developed I think I will have some leverage in negotiating this with a third-party or doing it ourselves. So, I am not hesitant on the business. I think the business is a good business. I am just not going to live with that current economics. We will do ourselves before we live with their economics.","Howard Penney","Got it. So sorry to keep coming over to you. So, it\u2019s not that you don\u2019t see the growth in delivery as taking share from other categories, you just don\u2019t understand the economics?","Gene Lee","I understand them. They are not favorable enough for me. And I am not going to give them their discount and there\u2019s too much profit in there because they don\u2019t have scale yet. And so, we are trying to understand what that model looks like and what it looks like for us from a profitability standpoint, and we can pinpoint what their profit is and got to get to a better resolution if they want to do it for us. If not, we will do ourselves. ","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Mergard from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Alex Mergard","I have a follow-up on how the pipeline is shaping up, and I heard your comments on LongHorn. Would you consider exceeding your long-term guidance for 2%, 3% new restaurant growth? I mean, do you consider that more of a self-imposed cap in order to execute on that growth? Any colour there would be helpful.","Gene Lee","Yes, Alex. The 2% to 3% is the long-term framework we have for a couple of reasons. One is people. We have to make sure we have enough people to open these restaurants and open them strongly and doing a great job with it. We think if we get too high above the 3% across Darden, it puts a strain on the people that we have in knowing the brand. There are some brands that are going to be above the 3% range and some brands are going to be below the 2% range but across Darden we think 2% to 3% is the right investment. And we do know that all of these restaurants on average are creating significant amount of value. But we also have other ways to return capital and to spend our capital, whether it\u2019s in dividends or share buyback. So, we want to balance all of our capital spending including new restaurants, we think 2% to 3% is the right amount.","Alex Mergard","All right. I appreciate that. And then one final follow-up. And that is on the strength of independent restaurants versus chain restaurants. It's a trend that we've been seeing for some time now. Are you seeing any changes to that dynamic? And how it may or may not be impacting your business? ","Gene Lee","Yes. I think the independent growth is happening in more of the big cities. And we see that, more of a real issue for our upscale brands. In Yard House and Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze whether they\u2019re located more in these upscale suburban areas or urban areas. We\u2019re not seeing an influx of casual dining restaurants in suburbia that are privately owned. This is an urban phenomenon and not really impacting LongHorn and Olive Garden.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Your line is now open.","Andrew Strelzik ","I just have one quick one here. These outlets that you provided through is a pretty attractive low-single-digit deflation. But we\u2019re seeing in some of the stake that you\u2019re seeing some inflation now. So, I guess, I\u2019m wondering in terms of the outlet. Is that due to the coverage that you have currently or is there something that you see in the beef market or what\u2019s you\u2019re hearing that, that makes you more optimistic going forward?","Gene Lee","Yes. We\u2019re fairly long right now in beef. So, we\u2019re covered and our teams are making good decisions along the way. ","Andrew Strelzik ","Okay. I guess, so when I think about, when I look at the LongHorn margins you\u2019ve talk a lot about some of the initiatives and things that are going on there. But we did see a nice sequential step-up in the face of margin expansion. Is it reasonable to assume then that we might start to see that moderate or do you think you reached a point in terms of the initiatives that this is a more sustainable type of margin growth at LongHorn? Thank you. ","Gene Lee","Andrew, we\u2019ve had a lot of work at LongHorn and Simplification to improve labor productivity. And again, they\u2019ve also had some deep deflation over the last few years that help margins. We still think there is margin improvement for LongHorn going forward. Maybe not to the level that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years, because eventually the beef deflation is going to become beef inflation and we\u2019re going to continue invest in quality at LongHorn. And we\u2019re just not ready to talk more about individual brand margins going forward. Although, if you look across Garden compared to our competitors we are the only ones drawing margins to really overtime, over last few years or actually the last six months. ","So, we feel good about where our margin is. We don\u2019t want to go too high on our margin, because we think value is important and that getting too far out of line with what the consumer is willing to pay. But we still have costs that we can go after, we saw our productivity gains that we can do to continue to expand our margins across Garden 10 to 40 basis points, which is what\u2019s in our long-term framework.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Anderson from Maxim Group. Your line is now open.","Steve Anderson ","Most of my questions have been answered. But just from modeling purposes. Just want to ask, when your next 53-week of fiscal year will take place?","Gene Lee","Give us a second to find that out. It\u2019s probably in a couple of years, but it\u2019s not next fiscal year, I\u2019m pretty sure. 53-week, I think it\u2019s. We\u2019ll get back to you on that.","Operator","We show no further questions in queue at this time. [Operator Instructions]. ","Gene Lee","Thanks. And I think we\u2019re ready to conclude the call. I want to remind everyone that we plan to release third quarter results on Thursday March 22, before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thanks everyone for participating in today\u2019s call. And have a happy holiday season.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may disconnect at this time. "],"7123":["Darden Restaurants, Inc.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I'll turn the call over to your host, Mr. Rick Cardenas. Thank you, sir, and you may begin.","Rick Cardenas - Executive Vice President Operations - LongHorn Steakhouse, Darden Restaurants, Inc.","Thank you, Marcella. Good morning, everyone. With me today is Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Brad Richmond, Darden's CFO. We welcome those of you joining us by telephone or the Internet. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections.

A reconciliation of these measurements is in our press release. In addition, we are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call. We will post this presentation under the Investors tab on our website after the conclusion of the call. We plan to release fiscal 2015 fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday, June 23, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. Following prepared remarks from Gene and Brad, we will take your questions.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gene.","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, let me say I'm thrilled to have been chosen by the board to be the next CEO of Darden. The board and I've established a terrific relationship, and I'm excited to continue to work with them and the talented team members throughout this great company.","This morning, I want to take time to discuss several things with you. First, I will outline the priorities that define our operating philosophy as we move forward. Second, I will provide an update on the early developments for our real estate portfolio and our continuing evolution. And, finally, I will share the details on what drove Olive Garden's solid performance during the third quarter and why we think, even though it's still early, the brand is building strong momentum. Brad will then provide more details on our financial results for the third quarter and an update on our expectations for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 as a whole.","My philosophy on running a great restaurant business is rooted in the fact we must have incredible focus and intensity around driving strong operating fundamentals. I like to call this getting back to basics. This means we're focused on culinary innovation and execution inside each of our brands, delivering attentive service to each and every one of our guests, and creating an engaging atmosphere inside our restaurants.","These priorities need to be supported by smart and relevant integrated marketing programs that resonate with our guests. By delivering on these operational and brand-building imperatives, we expect to increase our market share and deliver best-in-class profitability through same-store sales growth.","Since our last call, we've further defined how the Darden support structure can enable our brands to achieve their ultimate potential. First, we will leverage our scale to drive competitive advantages in our supply chain and G&A support, both of which will improve the value equation for our guests.","Next, we'll operationalize and apply the insights collected from our significant guest and transactional databases to enhance relationships with our guests, and identify new opportunities to drive sales growth.","And finally, we will embrace the unique cultures and entrepreneurial spirit of our brands, while relentlessly driving for operating efficiencies and continuous improvement, operating with a sense of urgency and inspiring a performance-driven culture.","We have made progress, as evidenced by this quarter's results, but our work is far from done. We must continue to improve in each of these areas in order to successfully move from an enterprise-centric organization to a nimble operations-focused restaurant company with benefits of scale and the spirit of a decentralized company.","Driving strong operational performance is our top priority. We also have the responsibility to efficiently allocate our capital and utilize our valuable assets to drive shareholder value. To that end, we have been conducting a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of opportunities to create shareholder value with our real estate, while also fortifying our credit metrics. This is an exhaustive analysis and the effort will take some time, and will likely take place in stages.","As a test case, a few weeks ago, we listed 16 properties for triple net sale-leaseback. These properties were chosen primarily because they could be sold on a very tax efficient basis. Otherwise, they were representative of Olive Garden and LongHorn locations generally. We saw great demand for the initial 16 properties and subsequently listed an additional 15 properties. To-date, we are extremely pleased with the success we have had securing letters of intent or contracts on the majority of the 31 properties at cap rates well below 6%. These properties will carry market appropriate rents and have favorable lease terms.","As we continue to analyze our options for our real estate, it is encouraging to receive positive feedback from the market with qualified buyers who are very interested in purchasing our assets. These results from these transactions will inform other real estate strategies that we're evaluating and may pursue for our broader portfolio.","We've also recently listed our corporate headquarters building to explore different structures, including a sale-leaseback, to create value for all our shareholders. We anticipate using the proceeds from these sales to repay debt, which is consistent with our intent to support the company's improving credit profile. We will continue to work with our advisers to carefully assess all ways to unlock value through our real estate portfolio, and look forward to discussing this further with you in the future when we have a more fully developed strategy.","Now, let's turn to the results for the quarter. Our brands performed well, and we're pleased to report strength in business performance in the third quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.73 billion, a 6.9% increase from the third quarter last year, with blended same-restaurant sales for the company up 3.6%. Earnings per share, on an adjusted basis, were $0.99 in the quarter, which represents a 39% increase year-over-year.","Brand by brand highlights were included in the press release this morning, and I want to spend this time discussing Olive Garden's performance in the third quarter, as well as how some of the operational and business improvements are starting to take hold.","During the quarter, Olive Garden increased same-restaurant sales by 2.2%, the second consecutive quarter of positive sales results. This is the first time Olive Garden has had back-to-back quarters of positive same-restaurant sales since 2010.","Olive Garden's restaurant level margins increased by 240 basis points versus the same timeframe last year. This significant improvement in profitability was the result of two primary drivers. First, labor. Olive Garden achieved its best direct labor efficiency in over a decade. This was due to actions we took to simplify operations to improve productivity, as well as better sales planning and scheduling by our management teams.","Second, marketing. We reduced marketing spend compared to last year when we significantly over-invested to drive traffic. Additionally, we made a deliberate decision to have fewer weeks of price pointed promotions in the quarter. We expected this would have negative impact on same-restaurant guest counts, but would drive higher profitability, which you can see in our third quarter results.","While cost of sales was slightly higher than last year, we did see improvement from the second quarter on a percentage of sales basis from improved cost management and moderating dairy inflation. These results are a product of the hard work Dave George and the team at Olive Garden have been doing over the past 18 months to improve every aspect of the business.","Continued operational simplification, a focus on cost controls, new menu items, and smarter promotional investments are all pulling together to strengthen brand appeal for the consumers, and significantly improve Olive Garden's results.","We are making operational decisions more quickly and have better lines of communication to our restaurant teams due to the reduction of leadership layers in the field, which occurred this past November.","The addition of the Cucina Mia menu offering, which has an everyday price point offering point of $9.99 in most restaurants to the core menu in February last year, mitigates the need for constant price pointed promotions.","Also, as our guests look for more convenience, Olive Garden is working to meet them wherever they are and provide them the different experiences they want, inside or outside of the restaurant. A strong example of this evolution is our to-go sales, which continues to show strong improvement year-over-year, with sales up 22% this quarter. Increases in large Parties To Go sales, this includes items like pans of lasagna and other large portions, increased our check average because we don't categorize these items into our guest counts. They accounted for 60 basis points of the 220 basis point increase and menu mix this quarter.","As we look forward, we will continue to refresh the Olive Garden brand. Our recently remodeled restaurants are performing well, with mid to high single digit same-restaurant sales increases. We will remodel an additional six restaurants over the next several months, with further refined investment levels. We will continue to analyze the performance of our remodeled restaurants to develop a more individualized plan per restaurant and ensure the optimal investment levels going forward.","I'm encouraged by the continued progress at Olive Garden and the $23 million increase in EBIT they delivered this quarter versus last year. With more than 800 restaurants and 90,000 team members, we knew that driving change would take time, and the results are starting to show. While we still have more work to do, we firmly believe that our focus on executing the brand renaissance will continue to enhance the guest experience and drive long-term, sustainable same-restaurant sales and profit growth.","Now, I'll turn it over to Brad for a detailed margin analysis and expectations for the remainder of the year.","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Gene. And good morning, everyone. I'll start with the margin analysis of the quarter. Food and beverage costs as a percentage of sales this quarter were higher than last year, driven by continued elevated beef inflation. Dairy costs are also higher on a year-over-year basis, but have moderated significantly from the second quarter. The impact of this inflation was partially offset by improvements in food waste.","Restaurant labor costs were approximately 50 basis points lower than last year, as a percentage of sales, due to sales leverage and improved hourly labor productivity at Olive Garden, that more than offset wage rate and benefit cost inflation. The overall improvement continued our positive performance from the second quarter.","Restaurant expenses as a percentage of sales in the quarter were approximately 80 basis points lower than last year, due to sales leverage, expense management, and lower pre-opening expense of approximately 35 basis points, associated with seven fewer openings in the quarter this year, compared to last year.","Excluding the adjustments noted in our press release for both this year and last year, general and administrative expenses were approximately 20 basis points lower as a percentage of sales from the impact of cost reduction initiatives we have undertaken over the past year, and from leveraging our sales growth.","Marketing expense, as a percentage of sales, were 100 basis points lower than last year, principally from the lower media support at Olive Garden that Gene mentioned earlier, and improvements in our non-working or the non-media marketing expense we have previously discussed, and from leveraging our sales growth.","Our income tax expense for the quarter reflects a 13% rate on continuing operations before adjustments. After the adjustments, our effective tax rate for the quarter increased to 19%. We estimate an annual effective tax rate on a reported basis to be a credit of approximately 7%, and after adjustments, to be an expense of approximately 16%. In summary, our third quarter financial results were better than our previous expectations, producing total EBIT margin that increased 200 basis points above last year on an adjusted basis.","With only the fourth quarter remaining in the fiscal year, I will provide some quarterly expectations in addition to our annual expectations. First, we expect fourth quarter same-restaurant sales growth for Olive Garden of plus 1.5% to 2.5%, Longhorn Steakhouse of plus 4% to 5%, and our Specialty Restaurants collectively at plus 2.5% to 3.5%. We also anticipate the addition of seven net new restaurants in the fourth quarter for a total of 34 net new restaurants for the full fiscal year.","As we think about the strong growth in Q3 margins and our expectations for Q4, we expect to achieve similar year-over-year improvements again in fourth quarter margin growth. However, we do not expect to see the same absolute EBIT margin levels in Q4, due to the normal seasonality that exists, in particular, the strong Christmas, New Year's, Valentine's Day sale weeks drive a higher absolute margin in the third quarter. Said differently, we increased EBIT margins from last year by 200 basis points in Q3, and we expect a similar level of improvement in Q4 versus last year. This margin expansion combined with expected same-restaurant sales growth should deliver fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.91 to $0.94, an increase of 69% to 74% over last year.","So as a result, our expectations for adjusted annual earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year is $2.45 to $2.48, an increase of 43% to 45% from fiscal 2014, which reflects the impact of higher share count prior to the accelerated share buyback program implemented in the fiscal year. In addition to our business improvements and the accelerated share buyback, other drivers of EPS growth include reduced interest expense from our debt reduction and the impact of the 53rd week.","We're in the midst of a detailed and deliberate planning process and anticipate sharing our outlook for fiscal 2016 during our earnings call in June. As we continue to evaluate our real estate options, we are also evaluating the most appropriate way to deploy the expected proceeds from the real estate transaction that we may undertake, along with the $436 million of cash on our balance sheet today. We are focused on maximizing shareholder value, while also supporting our improving credit profile.","We also continue to identify additional cost efficiencies. Since October, we have identified efficiencies that will lead to total annual savings and earnings improvements of $90 million to $100 million when fully implemented. Approximately half of these savings relate to SG&A, and the other half relate to savings in our supply chain and restaurant expenses.","Our fiscal 2015 expectations assume we achieve $30 million of savings within this year, and we anticipate $40 to $50 million of additional savings in fiscal 2016. We expect to achieve the full annual savings target in fiscal 2017, plus any additional savings initiatives that we identify.","And now, with that, I'll turn it back to Gene for some closing remarks.","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Brad. And before we move to Q&A, I want to share a couple of final thoughts. As we disclosed this morning, Brad has agreed to stay on as our CFO through the end of July in order to ensure a smooth transition. I want to thank Brad for his flexibility and his significant contributions during this transition period. We've engaged Chris Kohler Associates (19:08) and the search for a new CFO is well under way. This comprehensive search will include both internal and external candidates.","Finally, I want to recognize our team members that were an integral part of our performance this quarter. One of the key cultural shifts I set out to effect over a year ago was for our employees to put the guest first. I see this renewed enthusiasm and cultural shift taking hold, and I'm delighted to see this dramatic change throughout our restaurant teams and here at the support center.","I am confident that we can return Darden to being the premiere full-service dining company, and for that, I want to sincerely thank all of our 150,000 plus team members for embracing what makes us special, our ability to impact the special moments and experiences our guests entrust to us.","Thank you for your support and for your contribution to our results this quarter. Now let's open the mic for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. One moment for the first question. The first question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.","Jeff Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. Just first from a fundamental perspective, and I guess I should start by saying, Gene, congratulations on the full-time promotion.","My first question is specific to Olive Garden comps. It seems like there's some momentum building there. Needless to say, it seems like the industry is seeing some momentum as well. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about the recent improvement in trend. I think you gave us some color on this last quarter as well, but how you kind of decipher what you think is Olive Garden's specific versus what you think is kind of more macro-driven. It seems like Olive Garden perhaps is still a little bit below the broader industry, but it just seems like a very difficult task to assess how much of it is your own internal decision-making versus the kind of broader macro trend and then I had one follow-up.","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jeff, when I look at the quarter, I think there's a lot of positives in the Olive Garden performance. And I want to go back to what I was talking about in our prepared comments. And last year in this quarter, we over-invested in media and price pointed promotions, aggressively trying to drive traffic, and we came back this year with a much more balanced approach. And we brought our media spending back to the historical levels.","We still had some price pointed promotions in the quarter, however, last year at this time, we had two in market the whole time, which drove some guests and some same-restaurant, not sales \u2013 I mean not same-restaurant sales growth, but drove guests. When I think about the quarter now, we underperformed the industry in December and January, but we outperformed the industry in February, and February is a very difficult month from a weather perspective.","So I felt as though we built momentum through the quarter with this very balanced approach, where we were able to hang with the marketplace, the industry, but improve our margin structure and get it back to more of a historical norm. So when I think about the quarter, I think there are signs that we're really starting to make some improvement in Olive Garden.","Jeff Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And then the follow-up. I think, Brad, you did a good kind of recap of the different shareholder value initiatives. I know you're evaluating the real estate and the cost saving opportunity you gave us an update on. There was no mention of the Specialty Restaurant Group which trends seem to be doing quite well across most of the brands. I'm just wondering where we stand in terms of thoughts of spinning off those brands or whether perhaps there is a home for those brands still within the Darden portfolio?","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jeff, this is Gene. I'm going to take this question. As you did mention, all five of our brands in the SRG performed very well. We're very pleased with Yard House's performance, best quarter since joining Darden. Right now, our strategic focus is on two fronts. It's running our restaurants better, and second, it's the real estate.","As I said last quarter, everything is still on the table. We will come back and analyze other strategic alternatives that are available to us but right now, we're focused on those two initiatives. And I also talked in the call about our Darden philosophy and how do we get back to using scale to be a competitive advantage and allow all our brands to have a advantage in the marketplace because they're part of Darden. And I think that's key to driving long-term shareholder value.","Jeff Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move on to Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.","Michael A. Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great, thanks. This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. As you've been doing your real estate analysis, what have you uncovered about a refranchising opportunity at Olive Garden? Specifically, if you're looking at Olive Garden's owned real estate, can that be accretive to earnings if there was a refranchising of that? Thank you.","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","At this point, we have done no work at all at looking at refranchising. I don't want to go back and keep reiterating the same point, but we're focused on the real estate \u2013 creating value from our real estate asset to this point in time. Once we understand and move forward with that plan, we'll come back and revisit the other strategic alternatives that are available to us.","Michael A. Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities, your line is open.","Matt J. DiFrisco - Guggenheim Partners","Thank you. Actually, I had a question similar to that as far as the first question by Jeff with respect to the Specialty brand. I'm just curious, advertising-wise, are any of those brands changed in your opinion as far as should we still look at them as a Specialties division independent from Olive Garden and LongHorn as far as not needing advertising support? I think previously it was always sort of the line drawn was the national brands that were casual dining that needed advertising versus the big box brands.","In your opinion, as now the longer term, permanent CEO, any of those have the potential maybe to migrate over and be an approachable casual dining national brand more so than a big box guy that only has maybe the potential to do 200 restaurants or so? Specifically, I would think either Yard House or Seasons 52, or are we going to continue to see them in their current brand positioning and size of the format?","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Matt, I think for the foreseeable future, we're going to see them as big box, high-volume restaurant operators. I think Yard House has a lot of runway when you look at our current footprint. Longer term, there could be an opportunity to use a smaller box to deliver that brand, similar to what I would call their most liked competitor out there that's working on that today. But I like these businesses because the P&L has less than 1% marketing expense in them, which allows us to really work the value equation from a different angle. And that's really around the food offering and the service we provide; and, to some extent, the atmosphere we create in these bigger boxes. And so, I see them as higher volume executions with the real value in the experience that we deliver in the restaurants, and using a little bit of marketing, but it's more of that CRM one-to-one type marketing versus a national advertising type campaign.","Matt J. DiFrisco - Guggenheim Partners","Okay. And then just a follow-up question. You keep bringing us back to focus on the real estate. I'm curious can you give us more color on that as far as what we should expect over the next coming calls? As far as is this going to be updates on how you're approaching it now with 15 sale-leasebacks moving to 30 sale-leasebacks, or are we looking for one significant transaction which was discussed in prior quarters from various investor groups as far as something as a REIT structure and other formats, or are those things off the table and we're looking more so as far as monetization of a store-by-store basis or market-by-market basis?","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, Matt. Everything is still on the table at this point in time. We're using these 31 properties that we've put out here really to inform our strategy going forward. What we do think is that this is going to be \u2013 there'll be multiple executions to maximize the value of the real estate. And so, we're not locked into one significant transaction, but we may end up doing one significant transaction. We are doing a very comprehensive review. We have great advisers that are helping us; and we're still evaluating our options very, very carefully. However, we're incredibly encouraged by the reaction in the marketplace for our properties. A well below 6% cap rate is pretty exciting.","Matt J. DiFrisco - Guggenheim Partners","Great. Thank you.","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And we're doing that with market rents and favorable lease terms for OpCo.","Operator","The next question is from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have two follow-ups, if I may. The first is on the real estate. In the past, I know \u2013 I recognize a lot has changed, but the view was that based on what your advisors had or investment banking advisors had suggested was that a real estate transaction may not be the most value creative in the sense that it was looked at as sort of a more expensive way to add leverage.","And I guess my question is why is the analysis different now? Is it just because the cap rates are so much lower than what you had expected or what these advisors had suggested might be the case? And I guess, when I look at cap rates of 6% or even below 6%, it kind of looks similar to what kind of interest rates your debt's (30:24) carrying. So I'm just trying to figure out why the real estate makes so much more sense now than maybe it did before? So that's the first question.","The second question is just a little bit diving into the marketing spend. I think Brad said 100 basis points tailwind. In dollar terms, is that down around 20%? Is that right? How would we think about it going forward? Thank you.","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sara, I'll take the real estate question and Brad's looking up the answer for the marketing spend. What's different is that we're just taking a fresh look at this and a comprehensive look with a new set of advisors and looking at the marketplace and seeing what's available to us.","We're encouraged at this point in time. We're moving away \u2013 or moving towards more of a asset-light approach to the business, if it makes financial sense; and I think that's how we're thinking about it, and it's what's a little different. These cap rates that we're getting for our properties today are below or better than what we thought we would get when we originally did analysis of this 12 months to 18 months ago. And so, we're just taking a fresh look at what the possibilities are.","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And on the marketing question, Sara, it's down around 20% or maybe just a tad north of there. I think more importantly, if you look historically over time for the third quarter, which is seasonally (32:06) our best quarter, we're getting back to a typical support level for marketing that we need for that quarter, and we like that. We think for that particular quarter, it's somewhere in \u2013 that's in the sustainable range. We've also talked in the past about some of our initiatives around the non-working or the non-media part of that expense, around the agencies and production cost and things like that. We started that initiative a few months ago. It continues to build. So that's also a part of the driver of that reduced expense.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And we should continue to see some benefits there going forward as you focus on that?","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. We'd expect to see benefits there, particularly on the non-working part. That will continue, because a lot of those are long-dated contracts. That may take us a full year to realize that. But we will, each quarter, look at the business, the normal seasonality that we have there. Just like as we move to the fourth quarter, we know we have to advertise a little bit more to get the sales in. That's just kind of the cadence of the business. So on a sequential basis, it will move up some, but we're continuing to right-size that as we get into each new quarter.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And congratulations, Gene.","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","John Glass of Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks, good morning. I wanted to go back to the cost cuts. And Gene and Brad, you talked about $90 million to $100 million. That is less, though, than half of what your Chairman had originally proposed was probably available to the company. So, is that just the starting point, but you still think $200 million-plus is available to you? Is this more just a \u2013 more sober assessment now that you've had a chance to \u2013 cooler heads have prevailed and you've really looked at the business? How do you frame that versus what was proposed before?","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","John, I would say that we're pleased with the progress we've made to identify these cost saves at $90 million to $100 million, but we're just starting. We think the next level of cost reductions are going to be more entailed around process improvement and changing the way we approach a lot of our work.","We haven't really gone back and focused on trying to match up what was said by Starboard, and what we're doing today. We've just taken a fresh look at the business, and we're trying to get costs out. There's been an intense focus on areas that are non-consumer-facing, and that's what \u2013 that's where our focus has been through the last nine months is, how do we take costs out that will not affect the overall experience for the guest.","And that's what I'm most pleased with, is that this $100 million is coming out of our business, and the guest will not feel any of it. And so once we \u2013 we will continue to look for additional cost saves, additional process improvement, and try to drive this number as high as we possibly can. It gets back to the Darden support philosophy: Scale is going to drive a competitive advantage for our brands. And how do we use that scale effectively every day to give our brand an advantage in the marketplace.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And if I could just follow up, a big piece of that was looking at advertising. I know Olive Garden's advertising is down, but I think it's now still at historical levels, which run well above industry levels. Maybe you could just clarify what those levels are. I think it's like in the 5% range, maybe versus industry norms of 3% to 4%. Is that something that's an opportunity or do you look at that and say that's really part of what the brand is and it's what got us here and we can't \u2013 that's not an opportunity?","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. This is Brad here, John. And we have lots of history here, and two things that we need to look at is, what is the level of media support that we need to effectively communicate our message. And the other part of that is the non-working piece. We believe, and we've talked about in the past, there's significant opportunity in the non-working piece of that. If you look at our total marketing expense, it's gone to that non-working being over 20%, we think the mid teens is a better place to be. That's spending at the right level.","And then, as Gene talked about earlier, the media. What message are we supporting? Or in some cases, as we've done, we supported multiple messages. I think we've gone through that. We know we should be focusing on one primary message at the right level there. So that will continue to evolve, but it probably puts marketing in a low 4% range. And when you look at Olive Garden's particular model and the high AUVs that it drives, part of that is what the marketing does for that brand. And given their cost structure, it's well worth it to make those investments in marketing to improve the absolute dollars that they're generating in that business.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good, thank you.","Operator","David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird, you may ask your question.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good morning. Gene, I wanted to come back to the strategy on Olive Garden, with respect to pulling back on the marketing, I know this has been covered in several questions. But I'm just curious to know your thoughts on the overall traffic decline that you saw in the quarter, and how much of that do you think was related to the decision to pull back on marketing? And is that going to be a theme as you move through the next several quarters, negative same-store traffic, or are you hoping to sort of turn the tide on traffic trends in the coming quarters and get back into positive territory?","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Dave, I think there's going to be pressure on traffic for the next six months, as we were aggressively trying to grow traffic last year, and doing it in a way that wasn't good for the overall business. I'm pleased with the trend against the industry throughout the quarter, we're basically on the industry for traffic standpoint in February.","The other thing, when you look at our traffic numbers, is you have to remember all this large party takeout food that we're selling, it's 60 basis points effect on the traffic number, because we're not counting those as entrees at all, so it's not in our traffic number and I expect that to continue to grow. I mean that's a part of the business we're putting a lot of pressure on but we're not giving ourselves any guest counts for that.","And the reasons for that is it really would \u2013 the way we do our labor planning and the success that we're having with that right now, we think that changing the way we calculate our guest counts could have a negative impact in the short term on our execution.","But back to your question, we know we've got to change the momentum in guest traffic as we move forward, but we're not going to do it at all costs. We have a wonderful P&L at Olive Garden, a wonderful business model and we need to keep it more in balance. And the one thing that we're seeing from the consumer today is we are seeing the consumer's willingness to buy less on deal and actually for the first time in a very long time, we're seeing alcoholic beverage sales growth, we are seeing add-on sales growth, we are seeing more dessert sales. All these dynamics are coming together at once, and is really helping the Olive Garden business model.","So I'm putting a lot of pressure on the operating team and the marketing team to grow guest counts, but at the same time, we're going to focus on growing guest counts the right way. We're not going to over-invest like we did last year, as we move back to a much more balanced approach with historical media spends.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. That makes sense. And then one clarification on the real estate sales. I think you said that you're going to use some of the proceeds or all of the proceeds to pay down debt. And I guess maybe I'm missing something here, but it seems like even at a cap rate under 6%, a lot of your debt is actually at an interest rate below that. So how does it create value for shareholders to do the sale-leaseback and then to pay down the debt with that proceeds?","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","David, I think our plan is, first and foremost, is to improve our credit metrics to ensure that we maintain investment-grade credit profile. We will then use the proceeds and cash from operations to ensure we set up our balance sheet appropriately. We want to keep the capital structure in balance and over time, that should lift shareholder value. We see this as a bigger than just a treasury function. We see this is really moving to a more asset-light approach and setting up our capital structure in a way that we can get the greatest return for our shareholder. One thing that I want to keep coming back to is that these properties we're selling, we're selling them at market rents with strong lease terms for OpCo, so we think this is \u2013 again, we're using this just to inform us on a broader real estate strategy.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Will Slabaugh of Stephens, you may ask your question.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, guys. Just a couple quick follow-ups. On the first one, could you quantify what you think the estimate for the weather impact was in January and February?","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, for the entire quarter for our large brands, it's approximately 100 basis points. And on a month by month basis, December was impacted by about 210 basis points, January was adversely impacted by 110 basis points. In February, it actually reversed on a year-over-year basis, and there was 30 basis points hurting us this year. So, just to repeat that, we were benefited by 210 basis points in December, 110 basis points in January but adversely affected by 30 points in February and the total adds up to about 100 basis points.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. Thank you for that detail. One more quick follow-up, Gene, to a question \u2013 or to a comment, rather, you made a minute ago. It sounds like you believe we're actually seeing an inflection in the health of the consumer here. Do you think that's the case? And is that going to change more materially how you market to them going forward? And do you think that's really going to be an inflection in profitability at your brand here?","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, that's the point I was trying to make is that we are seeing a little bit healthier of a consumer. We're not seeing a direct impact on traffic, as you think back to discretionary income increasing, but we are seeing for the first time through Crest Data, through our own data, the guest is buying less on deal, and that's allowing us to grow our check average, and improve our overall profitability. We've been in this space for a long time. We've been trying to create value through deals for consumers to entice them to come see us and dine with us.","I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing through what the consumer is purchasing on their visit. Some of it is that we're doing a better job giving them what they want through Bold Bites in LongHorn, some of the to-go activity in Olive Garden, we're doing a better job in Olive Garden with our wine tasting program. So I think it's a combination of better execution from our operational teams, but also the consumer today seems to be under a little less pressure and is willing to pay a little bit more for their product. And we're seeing it with our price pointed promotions. Our preference is down on our price pointed promotions compared to where they were even a year ago or two years ago. So people are buying less on deal.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Joseph Buckley, Bank of America, your line is open, sir.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I had a couple of clarification questions. Brad, I think when you were discussing SG&A, I think you were saying it was actually down 20 basis points year-over-year if you exclude adjustments, and I just wanted to verify that and find out what adjustments were in SG&A.","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. The G&A portion only was what I was talking about, that's 20 points better, and 100 basis points for the marketing, so that's what you should see on the slides. And I think -- and you asked what were the adjustments. Let me go to the press release there. They were around \u2013 for the quarter, we had some strategic action costs principally related to the real estate assistance that we're having there, and also as a part of our real estate move, we had some excess land that we impaired the value of those. And you can see those detailed further in the press release.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So some of the real estate \u2013 I think the impairment is a separate line, if I'm not mistaken, right?","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So if you still want to say, expiration work, some of that's in the G&A?","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. And that was approximately $0.01 for the quarter.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Okay. Just on the tax rate. You gave us tax rates for continuing operations of what you're expecting. Could you remind us why it's so low and what happens next year or the next couple of years on that tax rate? And are your existing REITs a big part of that lower tax rate?","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, first off, to this year and the tax rate that we expect, and we have been detailing those both on a GAAP reported basis and on a performance adjusted basis. And on the performance piece, I think, is really where you're going that we're looking at 16%. That is a little bit lower than where we see the tax rate. So at more normalized EBT levels, that's probably in the 20% to 25% range is where we would see.","And I know over the years we've tried to communicate the advantages that our business model has, being all company-owned; and our scale gives us a lot of opportunities for tax planning, programs that we can implement, systems that we can build to make sure we capture those credits that makes it easier, non-intrusive to the operators. And so, things around food donation, things about employment credits. That being an all company-owned model, those all accrue to us. So when I do our work here doing long-term planning, I'm putting that, depending on the EBIT level, between a 20% and 25% effective tax rate.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just one more, if I could, for Gene. And, Gene, congratulations on getting the CEO position with the interim removed. You mentioned scale a couple of times in answers to different questions. Is that coloring the thinking around Specialty Restaurants? I mean that was always kind of the pro and con argument, was how much the profitability of the Specialty Restaurants was sort of feeding off the Darden G&A. So is doing something with the Specialty Restaurants less likely as maybe the new board understands the scale benefits?","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I think, again, everything is still on the table and will be carefully evaluated. As we continue to move forward, we're going to have to look at the scale advantage that these restaurants in the Specialty brands do get from Darden. We have to look at the synergies that are created. We also have to look at the growth that the Specialty brands create for the overall Darden business. But, as I said, we are going to focus our strategic energies around capturing the value that's available to us in the real estate. And we will come back and fully analyze what is best for our shareholders, as it relates to what the brand portfolio mix is going forward.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Jason West of Credit Suisse, you may ask your question.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, thanks. I was wondering if you guys would be willing to share the proceeds that you got from the sale-leaseback that you did. And were those units, the 16 properties and then the other 15 properties, were those all fully-owned properties where you own the land or was there a mix of land lease \u2013 yeah, land lease and building owned (51:17) properties?","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Those were all fully-owned properties, and we have not received any proceeds. We've got these under contract, but we have not closed on any of them yet.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, and would you expect any significant tax payments as part of these types of deals, or would they be pretty tax-free?","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. These deals were all done in a very tax efficient way.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. And then just on the outlook on cash flow, you guys are sitting on a lot of cash on the balance sheet. Can you talk a little bit about what the plan is there, what the long-term run rate you need on the cash balance? And then, any early color on CapEx for next year would be really helpful. I know you're evaluating some Olive Garden remodels. I'm guessing that unit growth will be similar, if you could talk about that, would be helpful.","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","This is Brad. And what I would say is we think it's very important to get all this right. And so, we want to get further into our work on the real estate process, so we know the size and the form of what that activity may be before we look at deploying the $430-million odd that we have on our balance sheet. But what we are focused on is continuing to improve our credit profile; also, looking at all the options that we have around the real estate; and to utilize this cash to improve our shareholder value creation.","And so, I think \u2013 I should just step back for a moment and just talk about the power generation of our business model continues to be strong. You can see with same-restaurant sales growth, growing the top line, the improvements that we have made in our margin, the model generates a lot of cash. And so, we need to get further in the real estate process, but the key focus is to continue to improve our credit profile and increase shareholder value. And we'll talk more about how we'll do that in June.","I think part of your question was indications on CapEx for next year. It's really too early to say on that, but you have seen us over time moderating the CapEx for new restaurants and all that. That will continue to moderate some. But beyond that, we're still working through, as you mentioned, remodels. Might there be other opportunities that'd be very appropriate for us to pursue, we're leaving all those options on the table at this point.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then, just one quick follow-up, the cost savings, the $90 million to $100 million. Does that contemplate some significant divestitures of real estate and savings that would go along with that or if you guys end up to selling a lot of properties under leasebacks, would you have a lot of G&A and D&A savings that may go with those sales?","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right. So the numbers I gave earlier are on a status quo basis, if you will. And so, those are, as we own and operate the business today, the actions that we're looking at, like you said in real estate, those will be all comprehensive. So we would look at the value they're going to create, which, like you said, if it's moving some of that out, there should be other reductions in the dollars we spend to support those activities. But those aren't encompassed in our savings. These are, I like to say, status quo, as we're operating the business today.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Howard Penney, Hedgeye Risk Management. You may ask your question.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","Thanks very much for taking my question. First, I just want to say it's a breath of fresh air to hear this company being managed very differently than it's been managed in the past, and a year makes a big difference. You were just actually asked about unit growth, and I was wondering if you could comment on unit growth; and was wondering if, I think, it was \u2013 34 would be \u2013 is that right \u2013 34 would be the high watermark for your tenure, Gene, in terms of unit growth, or whether you think you'll accelerate that or decelerate that? I'm just kind of curious in terms of your capital allocation. One of the things that I think was done in the past inappropriately was an aggressive \u2013 or unit openings were too high.","And then, secondly, just on the shareholder value creation piece and the real estate. Two questions; one, if we look to the Starboard presentation as to what the value of the Olive Garden real estate, is that a good proxy for that?","And then, secondly, I think you've been asked a couple times about effectively whether selling $500 million of real estate would be accretive or dilutive to earnings, and the math sort of suggests that it's dilutive, which actually is okay if it is dilutive because it's a part of a broader strategy to create shareholder value. So maybe if you could just confirm that?","And then, lastly, when you speak again in terms of the next fiscal year, will you provide longer term targets for where you think this organization, this enterprise, can grow sales and earnings, and maybe where the margins can get to? Thanks very much.","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Good questions, Howard. Let me start with new unit growth. I think as we look to 2016, I would expect to see a few less units in 2016 than we built in 2015. Longer term, it's too early for me to comment on what do we see for unit growth long-term. I think we have to do the work on what's the appropriate brand portfolio, what kind of growth vehicles are in the portfolio, how our businesses are performing.","We're going to be very diligent on return on invested capital and our approach to building new restaurants. If we have a portfolio of restaurants that can return well above our cost of capital, and we believe we're in good consumer segments, then we're going to build restaurants. But first and foremost, we're going to ensure that we're returning the right return on investment.","As far as the value of the real estate and is the Starboard a proxy for that, my thought on that is that we're still evaluating carefully, and thoughtfully, and methodically what's available to us in the value creation that we have available to us. I would \u2013 I suggest that you wait to we come out with our plan, and hopefully, we will be able to get that done within the next quarter or two quarters. And at that point in time, we will define what value we expect to receive from the real estate, and whether that's one transaction, multiple transactions, is it a real estate plan over time. Let us come to you with our plan and that will inform what the ultimate value of the real estate is.","As far as when we give guidance for 2016 in June, will we be in a position to give more of a longer term outlook for the organization. The short answer to that is, I'm not sure that we're going to be in a position at that time to have totally figured out directionally where we're going with all the strategic initiatives that are there in front of us. When that gets into brand portfolio, that gets in is there some franchising, is there some refranchising, how's international going to play in that. And so I think June is going to be a little bit early to really define a long-term outlook. However, I do believe that we'll be able to give you a glimpse into, directionally, where we think we're going at that time.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","Okay. Thank you. I was going to \u2013 that's fine. Thanks very much.","Operator","Keith Siegner of UBS, your line is open.","Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Just one quick one for me. There's been a lot of talk about maintaining the investment grade credit rating, and I just wanted to follow up a little bit on why so much attention here. We've got pretty low absolute levels of debt compared to a lot of other restaurants in this industry, got strong top line momentum, you've got significant cost saves plan, cash flow from ops should be improving improved nicely.","I'm curious as to why the cash or maybe even some of the proceeds from sale-leasebacks would get put into debt. Won't you maintain or even improve your credit ratings just from that core improvement in the business? Help me understand why so much attention on the investment grade credit rating.","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Keith, Brad here. You're bringing in all the things that we're thinking about. We have a few others, but we do believe \u2013 I believe for some time and continue to believe, even with the extensive discussion about Darden and where we want to be and the things we think we can accomplish, that an investment grade credit profile, as we look at it today, is one of those key elements.","To your point, improving base business helps the credit profile a lot, and so we continue to look at that. As we talk about the work we're doing in the real estate process, we want to make sure that as we do that, that it's consistent with that goal that we have. And so the real estate actions that we're talking about are not just for the credit profile. It's one of the requirements that we have on ourself, but we want to, as a part of that, ensure that our credit profile is moving in the direction that we think it should be. We have seen over time that the advantages that come with that, the access to capital at lower cost, is a competitive advantage for us, and we want to retain that with where we see ourself today.","Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Question is from David Palmer of RBC.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Congrats, Gene. Wanted to revisit Olive Garden. Aside from the economic factors, are there trends that are perhaps less obvious to us that are \u2013 and of course we're looking at traffic numbers \u2013 that speak to the brand health at Olive Garden, which presumably is making you more bullish as you look forward?","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David. A couple things that aren't visible. We think that one of the biggest moves that we've made to improve the operations at Olive Garden is to align our organizational structure with less layers. We are communicating, Dave and his team are much closer to the front line today. Communication has improved dramatically. We are seeing instantaneous movement in the focus areas of the operations teams. And that, to me, is one positive sign.","The fact that we have this $9.99 price point on the menu every day, that defines everyday value, that was missing in Olive Garden. And we're seeing a clientele develop in that menu category that we actually weren't anticipating. And the customization of that product is something that the Millennials are really attracted to, and so we think that's a platform that we can continue to beef up.","To-go is an exciting piece of the business, and I'm really excited about to-go, and we have got a product and a platform in Olive Garden that is meeting a huge need for the consumer, which is convenience. We've gone from this approach where we're trying to drive people into our restaurants and people today are less likely to, over time, want to come every single day to the restaurant, but they want to use your product. And we've been able to meet the consumer with this to-go program where the consumer wants to be met.","And we originally thought this was, we could move takeout from 8% of sales to maybe 12% of sales. We're starting to think that this is a huge opportunity. And 20% of our sales could come from takeout in the future in Olive Garden. And the satisfaction level of the consumer that's using this product is really, really, really high. We are over delivering on takeout, and some of that is just that our product travels so well.","But the last thing that I'd bring you back to is that Olive Garden will serve more guests this year than we've ever served in the history of the brand. And So some of that is coming from our new restaurant development over the years, but we continue to gain market share in all of casual dining and for me, that tells me the relevance of this brand.","And the last thing I would leave you with on Olive Garden is, we are over-indexing with Millennials, and Millennials are really attracted to this brand, and we need to find ways to allow them to use the Olive Garden brand the way they see fit.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Priya Ohri-Gupta, your line is open.","Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you. First off, congratulations, Gene, and thank you so much for all the comments on supporting the IG rating. Brad, I was hoping that we could dig in just a little bit into your comment around using some of the proceeds from your real estate transactions to pay down debt. It looks like your balance sheet doesn't show much in the way of short-term borrowing, so you would likely need to have to go after some of your long-term debt. Is that a fair assessment? And should we expect that sort of over the next quarter or two quarters? Thanks.","C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think \u2013 when I look at the real estate and where we are in the process, it's hard to be definitive as to exactly what's going to come out of that. And so I'm trying to be cautious to talk about the investment-grade credit profile, which is high on our list of things that we want to accomplish. And we haven't really talked about the size of what the real estate deal will be. We'll do it to the point where it makes sense, and there's different forms that it could take. And so as we have more clarity with that information, I can probably answer your question a lot better other than knowing the priorities that we have in terms of increasing value to our shareholders and improving our credit metrics, as we do all this work, those are two of our guiding principles.","Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Paul Westra of Stifel, you may ask your question.","Paul L. Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks and good morning. Just a follow-up question on your menu pricing strategy going forward and how that might compare to your best guess of the commodity basket and labor inflation as you look out next fiscal year. And specifically, I was wondering if you could give some guidance again on whether we should be expecting about a 2% or so menu pricing going forward, how you maybe arrived at that, which does appear to be below the industry's number which is closer to 3%.","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Paul. We're planning on trying to price Olive Garden slightly below the industry and to continue to grow our value leadership position. We'll give more guidance or more expectations in our June call on what the commodity basket will look like next year. However, I will say for Olive Garden, we will obviously have less pressure in dairy, which had a big impact on the P&L throughout the majority of the year, but our expectation for next year and into the future is to price Olive Garden slightly below the industry in order to regain and continue to be the value leader in casual dining.","Paul L. Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And it sounds like you are doing less discounting year-over-year. As you do the calculation, would that year-over-year less discounting, would that be captured completely in menu-mix number or on the pricing that you just bought?","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. When you look at our press release, we break that out. So you look at February, for example, we had 1.8% in pricing, and 2.8% in menu-mix, with 0.6% of that menu mix just being attributed to the bulk takeout orders that we're selling.","Paul L. Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. But philosophically, would \u2013 maybe end the question with, would you expect your ability to price and compare that to your underlying, I guess, food and labor, I mean, we shouldn't expect a big deviation between those two numbers?","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think there's going to be balance. I think we're going to continue to look at what we can do from a cost save standpoint, what we can do from an efficiency standpoint. Long term, when Olive Garden is at its best, it is the clear-cut value leader in all of casual dining. We lost that position over time over the last few years as we took more price than we should have been taking. And now, we are very conscious of maintaining that value leadership, and we will continue to look for other ways, other than just pricing, to offset inflation.","Paul L. Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Steve Anderson, Miller Tabak, your line is open.","Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak + Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. As we look at your takeout strategy, and by the way, it's very impressive given the strength of the 20% (01:10:26) plus gain there. But, are you concerned about the margins? Particularly given that the takeout sales traditionally have delivered lower margins, so that you don't really see the beverage or alcohol sales. What are your thoughts on that? Do you think it's more important that you get the actual absolute value on the top line gain?","Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director","When I look at the margins on the takeout business, especially as we move people to the bulk ordering, the margins are actually better. Because when you're doing bulk ordering, you're having less packaging. It's actually much easier to prepare, if we're just selling you a big sheet of lasagna and a big bowl of salad. And so we think the margins on that part of the business are better.","As we start to work more towards catering, we think we will have good margins in that. The check average on the online ordering is up 30%, vis-\u00e0-vis someone calling over the telephone or ordering in line. So we believe that our margins are protected at this point on to-go. They're not enhanced, obviously, because you lose the alcoholic beverage, so on and so forth. But we do have teams working on, how do we create a more comprehensive to-go experience. And can we \u2013 are we able to sell some beverages along with that experience, how else can we enhance that to ensure that we maybe actually increase.","This is a different guest occasion, and we've got a team that's working on it and thinking about it differently than how we run our in store operations. This is a huge opportunity. It is a need state that the consumer needs to be filled, and Olive Garden is meeting the consumer where they want to be. And we can do that because of the product that we serve","Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak + Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, we have no one else in the queue.","Eugene I.

We now welcome you to Darden Restaurants First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode and we will have question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please take note that we'll only take one question and one follow-up.","Now, let me hand the call over to your host, Kevin Kalicak. You may begin. ","Kevin Kalicak","Thank you, Ray. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO.","As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com.","Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings on December 19 before the market opens, followed by a conference call.","This morning Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights and Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from the first quarter.","As a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated Knapp-Track excluding Darden, specifically, Olive Garden and LongHorn. During our first fiscal quarter, industry total sales growth was flat, industry same-restaurant sales declined 1.2% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 3.3%.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene. ","Gene Lee","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we had a solid quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $2.1 billion, an increase of 3.5%. Same-restaurant sales increased 0.9% and diluted net earnings per share were $1.38.","Comparable same-restaurant sales for the industry continued to weaken during the quarter as the industry once again faced tougher comparisons. However, the industry comping negative is surprising considering unemployment remains at all-time low and there continues to be strong wage growth, which historically has been a positive for the industry.","I'm particularly pleased with the performance of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, given the industry performance and their difficult comparisons over the first quarter of last year. We remain focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy and leveraging our four competitive advantages. And I'm pleased, we continued to take share and protect our margins.","Turning to brand highlights for the quarter. Olive Garden had strong quarter, which resulted in its 20th consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 3.6%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 2.2% and 1.4% growth in new restaurants.","Olive Garden same-restaurant sales gap to the industry was 340 basis points this quarter, representing the largest gap to the industry since the first quarter of fiscal 2019. And on a two-year basis Olive Garden grew total sales by nearly 10%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 840 basis points.","Olive Garden's results were driven by the team's ongoing focus on flawless execution, everyday value, and convenience. Guest satisfaction ratings remain impressive, and catering delivery metrics reflect the highest intent to recommend within the brand giving us confidence that our teams are delivering great experiences inside and outside the four walls of our restaurants.","The Olive Garden team made a strategic decision to change the order of their first quarter promotions. This was necessary to separate their two strongest value promotions; Buy One Take One, and Never Ending Pasta Bowl to more evenly deliver the value messaging throughout the year. While this change along with associated media shifts and weakening industry trends resulted in lower traffic than last year, it was the right strategic decision for the long term.","Recognizing the strength of Buy One Take One promotion, Olive Garden added $5 take-home entr\u00e9es to the Everyday value lineup, which was supported with national advertising to drive awareness. It has been met with strong guest demand, and it will be a catalyst to continue to grow the off-premise business.","Everyday value was also strengthened with the introduction of a new weekday lunch menu with 21 options under $10, including guest favorites like Chicken Parmigiana and items from the Taste of the Mediterranean menu like Chicken Margarita. This initiative was supported by integrated marketing and resulted in stronger weekday lunch traffic and guest preference.","Finally, the Olive Garden team remains focused on their off-premise capabilities to meet their guests' needs for convenience. A key part of that focus has been optimizing the digital sales channel for both mobile and desktop. During the quarter, digital sales grew by more than 30% and represented approximately 40% of to go sales.","Overall, off-premise sales grew 12%, representing 14% of total sales. Olive Garden remains a truly iconic and broadly appealing brand and the team is doing an excellent job of focusing on this strategy and competing effectively.","LongHorn Steakhouse had a strong quarter as well. Total sales grew 4.6%, driven by 2% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.6%, the 26th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth.","On a two-year basis, LongHorn grew total sales by 11%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 940 basis points. The LongHorn team remains focused on their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution, and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement.","During the quarter, the LongHorn team ran two successful menu promotions; Grill Master Favorite and Fire Crafted Flavors, which were supported by their award-winning You Can't Fake Steak advertising campaign. They also supported these promotions by reinforcing their quality story through multiple guest touch points.","The team also continued to focus on ensuring the to go experience equals their in-restaurant experience for guests who choose this convenience. The team simplified the online ordering process, which significantly reduced the order time.","During the quarter, digital sales grew almost 50% and represented more than one-third of total to go sales. Additionally, they have now completed a dedicated to go area in more than half of their restaurants. These actions led to continued improvement in guest satisfaction scores for order accuracy and timeliness and helped to drive to go sales growth nearly 12%.","Finally, LongHorn's industry-leading retention rates continue to even get better despite the tight labor market. Team member turnover during the quarter was 68% compared to approximately 120% for casual dining, and management turnover during the quarter was 13% compared to approximately 36% for casual dining. We know that engaged team members provide better guest experiences, and the LongHorn team's ongoing focus on retention and culture building is a key driver of the strong business performance.","Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen total sales decreased 2%, driven by same-restaurant sales decline of 5.4%, and partially offset by sales growth from new restaurants of 3.4%. The trend change was driven by reduced marketing efforts and overall industry softness in the quarter.","In addition, the same-restaurant sales decline continued to be more pronounced in the former franchise locations. These restaurants experienced significant disruption during the quarter as they were the last restaurants to complete the kitchen transformation project.","While it's disappointing to see the sales trend decline, the Cheddar's team made significant progress against their priorities during the quarter. At the beginning of the new fiscal year, they established three new strategic priorities; create a people focused results-oriented culture, reduce friction in the guest experience, and build a brand people talk about with the goal of building on the progress they made last year repairing [ph] fundamental elements of the business and improving the sales trajectory.","During the quarter, the Cheddar's team continued to see improvements in both the manager and team member turnover trends as they implemented initiatives that led to higher retention levels.","Overall, staffing levels for both the manager and team members improved during the quarter. Because of the progress made this quarter in staffing and intention, the Cheddar's team was able to better execute operational improvements designed to enhance the guest experience.","For example, they implemented standard that significantly upgraded their abilities to successfully serve large parties. With these and other improvements, they saw a better guest experience results compared to last year across all key metrics.","Near the end of the quarter, Cheddar's introduced the new menu with more price diversity within categories and they launched their Quick Pick Lunch Combos starting at $5.99. These combos are generating strong preference at lunch and have led to higher value and intend to return ratings compared to last year.","I recognized there's still a lot of work to do, but the progress the Cheddar's team has made operationally and their improved HR metrics are encouraging. Now that they feel they're moving in the right direction from an operation and staffing perspective, they will begin to increase their working media spend.","Cheddar's has the highest guest frequency of any Darden brand and this investment is intended to build upon the strong position, improve brand awareness and drive trial. They will be leveraging Darden resources and best practices to implement the media plan.","Finally, during the quarter, we acquired four previously franchise restaurant locations in Texas, and I'm pleased to say that each of these four restaurants is performing at a very high level.","In closing, I\u2019m pleased with the progress our teams made executing against the strategic initiatives. Our strategy is working, allowing us to continue to grow sales, increased market share, improve margins and invest in our people and brands, all while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.","Of course, none of this would be possible of having the best people in the business, so I want to take this opportunity to thank you our 185,000 team members who continued to create memorable dining experiences for our guests.","Now, I'll turn it over to Rick.","Rick Cardenas","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. We had another good quarter with total sales growth of 3.5%, driven by 2.6% growth from the addition of 40 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 0.9%.","First quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.38, an increase of 3% from last year's diluted net earnings per share. We paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $95 million in shares, returning over $200 million to shareholders this quarter.","Before I get into the detailed results from this quarter, I want to mention that we adopted the new accounting standard for leases at the beginning of this fiscal year. Consistent with the expectation discussed on last quarter's call, we estimate that this will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.05 in fiscal 2020. However, the more meaningful impact was to our balance sheet, as you saw from this morning's press release.","This quarter, we also updated our segment reporting. Beginning in fiscal 2020, our calculation of segment profit now excludes non-cash real estate related expenses and fiscal 2019 has been restated for comparability. This change allows for more consistent evaluation of our business across segments and fiscal periods.","Now turning to our detailed margin results. Food and beverage costs were flat to last year, as pricing of 2% and continued cost savings initiatives offset commodity inflation of approximately 1.5% and continued investments. I'm impressed with restaurant labor being flat to last year, particularly in light of same-restaurant sales growth of 0.9%. Total labor inflation of 4% was offset by pricing, check mix and productivity improvements in new and existing restaurants.","Restaurant expense was unfavorable 10 basis points due to deleverage, as our comp sales growth was below inflation. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin of 18.1% was 10 basis points unfavorable to last year. General and administrative expense was 50 basis points lower than last year and favorable mark-to-market expense, which is generally offset in the tax line, lower management incentive expense and sales leverage.","Our Q1 effective tax rate of 9.8% was slightly below the range in our annual guidance. We still anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11% for the fiscal year. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance this quarter and impressed with our strong EAT margin of 8.1%.","Turning to our segment performance. Olive Garden grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin increased 40 basis points, by leveraging the same-restaurant sales growth and managing cost-effectively. LongHorn also grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth.","Segment profit margin decreased slightly, due to elevated beef inflation and continued investments during the quarter. Fine Dining grew sales and profit in the quarter as well, driven by a positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin decreased because of higher pre-opening expense and inefficiencies related to three new restaurants.","Sales for our Other Business segment grew 1.8%, driven by net new restaurants. Both segment profit dollars and margin decreased this quarter due to margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales growth in the quarter.","As you saw in the press release, we reiterated all aspects of our fiscal 2020 outlook. Looking ahead at our second quarter performance, there are two things I would like to address before we open up the call for questions. Both of which are contemplated in our annual guidance.","First, the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday this year, relative to last, is shifting from the second quarter, into the third quarter. Since we are closed in the majority of our restaurants on this day, this shift should positively impact Darden's second quarter same-restaurant sales, by approximately 80 to 100 basis points with a corresponding offset in the third quarter.","Second, given a prolonged media coverage and the storms duration, Hurricane Dorian had a meaningful impact on the first two weeks of our fiscal second quarter. We are currently estimating a drag of 20 to 30 basis points to same-restaurant sales in the second quarter.","And with that, we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open, sir.","Matt DiFrisco","Thank you. My question is with respect to the Cheddar's, I guess, lagging in difference between Olive Garden and LongHorn. Would you attribute that mostly, it sounds like to the marketing spend? Can you sort of bracket or compare how much pullbacks of marketing spend there was versus last year in either terms of dollars or in terms of weeks of support, so we could get a better understanding of that?","Gene Lee ","I'm not -- we're not going to get that granular with our spending in Cheddar's. I would just say that we now have enough transactional data to look at some things in Cheddar's we haven't had the opportunity to do before.","And one of the big insights is that our frequency in Cheddar's is higher than any other Darden brand. And we married that up with some of the research that we were doing, and we recognized that our awareness for this brand is extremely low.","And our primary advertising had been more driven towards a frequency play. And we decided, once we have this insight during the quarter, we were pulling -- we pulled back from that type of activity, and now we're going go out and we're going to test and learn and understand how to best increase our awareness in markets.","We also recognize the fact that it's going to be more important than ever in this environment to continue to build out our markets, develop our -- become more efficient in those markets from a media standpoint, and I would say more -- use more traditional media to increase our awareness to drive this business.","And so, it was a really good quarter from that -- from an insight standpoint for us to really recognize, and we decided we were going to change direction and that's where we pulled back a little bit of the media spend during the quarter.","Matt DiFrisco","Okay. And then, I guess, is there something different to the menu that may be triggered a change in frequency to the heavy, heavy user from the past, or is it the change in ownership that they noticed or something like that?","Gene Lee ","No, it's just the fact that we actually now have the transactional data to be able to analyze and have that insight. That's why it's so important when we do an acquisition for us to put our systems in, so that we can get the data and then do our analysis.","Matt DiFrisco","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird. Sir, your line is open.","David Tarantino","Hi. Good morning. Gene, I just wanted to talk to about the industry trends that you're seeing. It seems like your analysis in the prepared remarks that this was a little surprising that we've seen such soft trends, especially in the most recent months. So just curious to get your thoughts on why you think that's happening? And secondly, do you think you need to adjust any of your marketing or promotional strategies to the new environment so to speak? Thanks.","Gene Lee","Yeah. Good morning, David. As I said in my prepared remarks, the backdrop appears to be very strong for the consumer. We have good wage growth. We have strong employment. Historically, that's been really good for us.","As we look at the data and we when look at behaviors, when we look at confidence I have -- I personally believe that there's some uncertainty entering into the consumer, and it's impacting their confidence.","How long? I\u2019ve got to believe there with all the media attention around what's happening, how long does this continue -- this environment continue? So, there's nothing structural that we see that's changed out there other than there appears to be a little bit more uncertainty today than there was in the future.","As far as what do we need to do? We need to continue to create compelling guest experiences and come up with -- and reinforce our value propositions. I do think that we have to think about how we're going to market in our smaller brands and how do we advertise those brands in different channels and become more effective and compete more effectively? I think that's an important change that we need to make in the upcoming quarters.","I think we have the luxury of being patient and test and learn and really make great long-term decisions as we try to figure out how to support those brands and compete more effectively in this marketplace. We're pleased that we're heading into Never Ending Pasta Bowl in Olive Garden, it\u2019s a great promotion for us. We had a lot of buzz around our Pasta Pass this year. And so, I think it's a good promotion going into this time of year and where the consumer\u2019s at.","David Tarantino","And maybe just a follow-up Gene, does the current environment, or what you've seen recently make you think differently about the degree of difficulty in hitting your comp guidance for the year? I know you have maybe lesser fiscal [ph] comparisons coming up. And how should we think about the middle of the comp guidance or the upper end of the comp guidance relative to where you were three months ago?","Gene Lee","Well, I guess, we reiterated our guidance today. We believe our same restaurant sales for the year will be somewhere between 1% and 2%.","David Tarantino","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys. This is actually Neal [ph] on for Will. Thanks for taking the question. Just quick one here. Wondering if you can give any insights into commodity costs? You spoke to some elevated beef costs there. Just wondering how you're feeling about this going forward, whether you\u2019ve seen any effects from African swine fever?","Ricardo Cardenas","Thanks, Neal. This is Rick. We were about 1.5% inflation in the first quarter, which is around where we expected it to be. We have seen a little bit of elevation in beef, but the boards are coming back down and are a little bit more in our favor. So, we still expect our inflation to be where we thought at the beginning of this fiscal year.","As a result, or as an answer to your African Swine Flu question, we still haven't seen a very big impact in African Swine Flu. As we mentioned in the last call, pork is really only about 2% of our sales. So, it's a relatively small impact. And we haven't seen the downstream impacts of pork prices yet.","Unidentified Analyst","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Joshua Long from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Joshua Long","Great. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to circle back to the trends you've seen here lately and maybe any sort of regional variations, or any regional variations you've seen across the system? And then, also, in terms of your initiatives and kind of the underlying trends you've seen, any sort of differences in the weekday, weekend trends? You've got some very strong lunch offerings in there, but didn't know if that was may be moving the needle like you expected or may be ahead of expectations?","Gene Lee","No. I really don't have a lot to add to your question. We\u2019ve really not seen much from a geographic standpoint and there's really been no trend change to any of the weekday, weekday night, weekday lunch or a weekend business. I would say that, the trends have weakened in all areas of the business.","Joshua Long","Great. Thanks. And then one follow-up, if I may, in terms of your work on the To Go business, the strength there is still very promising. Any sort of learnings you've had as you stuck with this and worked on the fulfillment internally, versus the thought process of working with external partners? I know, you're always testing and always learning. But curious on what you're seeing there, if there's any update.","Gene Lee","I think, the biggest thing our teams are doing is, they\u2019re taking friction out of the process. And, I think, we're getting -- it\u2019s like anything else, repetition is a great thing. You continued to get better and better with it, as you do more business.","So, I think LongHorn has made tremendous progress. We've seen their scores go up, their satisfaction scores go up. Olive Garden has really honed in on this process. They continue to find ways. Very, very impressed with the digital growth in both of those businesses.","We think that's something to continue to look at. So to me, it's really about making that experience as compelling as we possibly can with great value, right. I think, it's -- and that's been our strategy is, to make sure that we have strong value on the off premise and not have the consumer be willing to come pick it up, versus it being delivered.","Joshua Long","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Levy from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Brett Levy","Good morning. Thanks for taking the call, gentlemen. If we could just hone in a little bit more, I'm going to ask the consumer question a different way and hopefully get some sentiment of a different answer. When you think about\u2026","Gene Lee","We could try.","Brett Levy","I'll try. When you think about the consumers right now, are you seeing any changes in how they're using you? Obviously, take-home is further building out your off premise, but are you seeing any changes in terms of full price value add-ons, size of parties, something like that? Thank you.","Gene Lee","No, Brett. No, we haven't seen any change at all. And -- when I look at the quarter -- let me put it back to look at the quarter. Let's think about what Olive Garden has done in the last two years. Even though the industry has weakened, I'm incredibly impressed that we've grown our business approximately 10% at Olive Garden with two-year comp that I think is extremely impressive.","And so the industry and a lot of the comments that I made today about the industry decelerating, I look at our two large brands; I think they're competing very effectively. The gaps are very, very strong to the industry.","So, I think we have a way to compete very effectively with these two brands and I'm excited. And yes, we watch the industry and we give you some insight to it, but our job and our leaders' jobs are to find a way to compete effectively in any environment and I think that's what our teams have done really well in this first quarter. ","Brett Levy","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John Ivankoe","Yes. Hi. Thank you. It\u2019s also just an industry question for you Gene. Obviously, Knapp all-store traffic has actually been negative and what I think you said to a previous question is a relatively strong underlying consumer environment, especially in terms of some of topline trending. Where do you see -- that consumer actually going? I mean where -- if that consumer is working and that consumer has higher income, where is that consumer currently dining -- whether it\u2019s in the house or out of the house is kind of the first question?","Secondly, do you see independence -- being great cycle as we are as potentially taking care versus chains? And what would you look out to maybe a shake that some supply growth that\u2019s been added in the space over the last several years?","And then the final point, I think, you kind of you mentioned a few times more value at Olive Garden and in Cheddar\u2019s. Is there any thought of bringing back couponing and doing other things that are going to be direct call to action for the consumer for you to maintain traffic and what you described earlier as any industry environment?","Gene Lee","John, you get the award for most questions inside a one question.","John Ivankoe","It's all related. I think you can do it in one paragraph. ","Gene Lee","I got independence, I got discount. What was the first?","John Ivankoe","The first one was\u2026","Gene Lee","Where are people are going. John we are definitely seeing some strength in limited service both fast casual and quick-serve, there's no doubt about that. And you think about there is good income growth on the lower end of the curve and those folks seem to be trading or dining out a little bit more frequently. And I don't know where people are trading out of in casual when you look at a 10-year period, that's been a big question. I'm not sure we\u2019ve had -- we as an industry, you have an answer. Again, we focused on our brands and we seem to be getting more than our fair share.","The data that we're looking at is saying that large chains are still taking more share and they're taking that share from independence. Where you see independence and small regional change are in really what I would call the better, better trade areas, the higher income trade areas, where they are having an impact and I think performing well.","But I think on a national scale, when you look at it, independence are still donating share and large brands continue to do better and take share from both smaller probably a little bit older brands and independents.","As far as discounting, we're going to continue to use, whatever levers we can use to grow our business. When you look at -- when we look at incentives, we don't look at just as one piece. We have to look at our overall advertising program. What is going on from a television standpoint, what's going on from a digital and online, what are we doing from an incentive standpoint. We have multiple ways to put incentives out there. And so we have a lot of leverage that we can pull over time depending on the environment. And we will use those appropriately to drive our business in a profitable way.","The one thing that, I think that we are proud of, and I'm very proud of our teams is that we continue to drive our business, while protecting our margins. And we continue to invest in our business, invest in quality, invest in food, invest in portion size, invest in our people, and we're able to do that in a way that has protected our margins. And as Rick talked about, our plus 8% EBIT margins are incredibly impressive in this environment. And so when we think about incentives, we think about it holistically and all that we're doing to build our brands over the long-term.","John Ivankoe","That's great, very helpful, excellent answer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Strelzik","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Over the last couple of months, we've been hearing a lot more about delivery take rates coming down, being renegotiated lower. Wondering if that changes your perspective on the liability of delivery for Darden at all, especially as you've kind of highlighted some of the changes on the digital side and the willingness given the numbers that you cited for customers to engage with the brands digitally, if your thoughts are evolving at all on delivery?","Gene Lee","No. We haven't -- we really haven't -- have any -- thoughts haven't evolved at all. We will acknowledge that the cost burden does appear to be shifting from the company to the consumer, and we are going to watch that closely. But I think -- I have a lot of concerns about that. This is still -- we're still -- it's all about value and how much of the overall experience are you willing to dedicate towards convenience?","And so it's something to watch. It's definitely a shift that we internally predicted that would happen. And we'll watch it, but I want to pivot back to what I said earlier, our job is to create a compelling off-premise experience right now that -- with so much value that consumer is willing to come and get it. That seems to be working for us and we're going to continue to focus on that.","Andrew Strelzik","If I could just follow-up on the value piece then just quickly. The Olive Garden price was about 2% for the quarter. Was that what the underlying price was? Not that it's a huge deviation from where you've been prior, but should be thinking about a little bit more price broadly at Olive Garden going forward?","Rick Cardenas","Andrew, this is Rick. The price was 2.2%, I believe in the first quarter and that's just due to timing of pricing year-over-year. We still expect our price to be below 2%, which is our long-term goal to keep pricing below our inflation and below our competitors to increase our value perception in the marketplace, while still making great investments. So, yes, this was just a little bit of a timing anomaly for the quarter.","Andrew Strelzik","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Anderson from Maxim. Your line is open.","Stephen Anderson","Yes. Good morning. I would actually want to ask about the test you have underway for your rewards programs to see a multi-concept. As I recall, it\u2019s about 7% of your storage, you're testing that out right now. I wanted to ask about how the test is progressing? And whether you are ready to roll that out to additional locations, or potentially entire system? Thank you.","Rick Cardenas","Hey, Stephen, this is Rick again. Thanks for the question. As you said, yes, we have our loyalty program in about 7% of our restaurants and that -- across the nation. We're still monitoring that test. As we have said quite a few times, this is going to take a long time to understand the frequency driving nature of the loyalty program and how much we\u2019d have to provide discounts to our most loyal consumers to come to us, versus other incentives for them to come.","The test is going okay. It's going well, but we're not ready to pull the trigger on adding more restaurants. We're going nationally. And when we do, I am sure all of you will be to first to know. But, right now, we're kind of holding steady on our test. The fact that it's still out there, tells you that it's not going well, but we want to just make sure that it's the right thing to do in the long run, as part of what Gene says, our overall strategy of how do we market to our consumers.","Stephen Anderson","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Also, please limit your question to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Our next question is from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your line is open.","Dennis Geiger","Great. Thank you. Just wanted to ask about mix, and I guess specifically on Olive Garden, is the impact that you saw in the quarter was roughly in line with expectation prior to the quarter? And then, more importantly, just looking out over the next few quarters, anything that would make you think the mix contribution could remain above kind of a long-term steady state? I guess if you could just kind of highlight some of the mix considerations this year, some of the puts and takes, thinking about incentives, trade-up promos, catering delivery or catering off-premise, et cetera. Thanks.","Rick Cardenas","Yes. Two things, I think, that will probably drive mix maybe a little bit above our target will be continued growth in catering and catering delivery and the addition of the $5 Take Homes. Those two things probably are going to drive that mix slightly above our long-term expectations. The $5 Take Home is a great value offering and it's something that we think is a real catalyst to continue to drive the off premise business, which should have a little bit more of a positive mix than what we want to try to do for a long-term.","Dennis Geiger","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Eric Gonzalez","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I think in the first quarter you benefited from a few extra weeks of the Buy One Take One as you pull that forward. But I think you said in your comment that it was a drag on traffic due to media shift. So I was wondering if you can maybe clarify what you meant there.","And I know you had the hurricane impact, but perhaps you can quantify what the impact of not having those extra weeks of the Buy One Take One in the early part of the second quarter? Thanks.","Rick Cardenas","No. We're not going to talk about the second quarter impact. And we shifted some media; we moved things around, which is always going to move our comparisons somewhat. But I'll go back to my statement; this was something we think strategically needed to be done. And -- again, I would also add this also always shifts in our media spending, as we -- it's the only way you can really discern what is working and what is not working and what -- and where to put more weight against, whether it's promotion or lunch or value is that you have to change the media spend to learn.","And so we shifted a little bit inside the quarter. I wouldn't get caught up in that I point back to a great two-year stack great our performance in the industry. We made a strategic -- a big strategic choice to separate the two value promotions that gives us more balance in our value messaging throughout the year, which is really important. Let's not get hung up on a week-to-week media shifts.","Eric Gonzalez","If I could maybe sneak in a follow-up there. On the $5 take-home and the Buy One Take One are similar type of -- they are sort of similar programs, are you moving away from Buy One Take One next year or is that something that's on the table?","Gene Lee","No, I think they're similar, but different. And so there are different types of value offering and our team will continue to reenergize Buy One Take One, it's an important part of our value proposition. And if it's done right, it will continue to support the $5 take-home. It shouldn't be a cannibalistic thing. It should -- it really should support it and move it after you run Buy One Take One that should be the springboard for a $5 take-home for the rest of the year and you can reenergize the promotion each year. So, that's how we're thinking about that. So, it should be additive not -- it shouldn't be dilutive at all.","Eric Gonzalez","That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass","Thanks. Thanks very much. First just on the other brands and the continued softness there. I think you commented last quarter that there is increased competition. So, maybe what we're seeing here is just more of that. But can you talk about how you think about -- what it's a breakthrough strategy to help market those brands better if you can achieve them national advertising scale of those brands?","And does delivery makes sense in some -- we talk about delivery holistically, do you like delivery or not. But does it make sense in some brands, may be some of these smaller brands, it's worth giving a try given that they don't have that scale and delivery through the aggregator sort of provide scale that they don't otherwise have?","Gene Lee","Well, it's an interesting concept John. As you think about the smaller brands, we've been reluctant to really add a lot of marketing costs to these businesses. They are unique; they've got great strong value propositions. But I think in this environment, I think we finally come to grips with that we're probably going to have to spend a little bit more money and become -- and try to find which channels in the digital environment can work best for them.","I think there's not one channel that would work across all our small brands. And so each of them are so unique, we have to figure out what's the best way to talk to the consumer. As far as off-premise, our third-party delivery for the smaller brands, I really don't see that as upside. We do have one of our tests in the majority of the Yard House's. We are using a provider.","Just think about where Yard House is located. It's embedded in a lifestyle center with no parking and so it's more difficult even for the last-mile provider to get in there and pick up the food. So, it's not a big part of the business. So, I don't really think about that as a way to grow the business. I think that, we need to make really good long-term decisions. We've been able to protect our margins in these businesses. We've got to continue to innovate and make them attractive.","We also have to recognize -- there's a lot of volatility in these businesses. And it goes back to -- if you open an another restaurant that looks like you are in the same development. It's going to have a one year impact on the comps. And we have that once in a while. These are great brands.","We're going to, obviously, try to compete a little differently as we go forward. I wouldn't look for a big change here in the next couple of quarters because we're going to test and learn and we're going to do it responsively. These are strong business models and I'm not going to put the brands on sale to get a headline number. We're going to protect the overall business for the long-term.","John Glass","Thank you. I'm sorry to belabor the value point on Olive Garden. I just want to make sure I understand this correctly. You spent last year reducing some of the couponing or discounting and reserving that value power if you needed in the future.","Are you now suggesting you need that today, or is this still, it's in the reserve, but you are not really changing your view on increased value promotions in 2020 as it stands today?","Gene Lee","I mean as it stands today, I think, our position is exactly the same as it was the past couple of quarters that Olive Garden continues to perform extremely well, in over 300 basis points gap to the industry.","We'll continue to look at each promotion, and what kind of support that promotion needs, depending what we're doing from a television standpoint. I do think that the analyst community and investor community is looking at things too much in isolation. And you don't have the whole picture of what's happening from overall media spend.","And because we run a TBI or a TBI test, you read into a situation that things must be bad. I think that's not the way to look -- to analyze our business. It's just one of many levers that we have to pull to support our business. And right now I think, we're looking at the Olive Garden business as being competing extremely well in the environment.","John Glass","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jake Bartlett from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Jake Bartlett","Great. Thanks for taking the question. My question was about Cheddar's. And I'm wondering where you think you are now in the integration of the business, the turnaround of operations, the improvements and in the context of your acquisition and strategy going forward? Do you feel like you're in a position now, where you might get more active on acquisitions?","Gene Lee","Well, that's a two-part question. I think where are we on Cheddar's? I think today, I'm more optimistic than I've ever been. I think, as I acknowledge in my opening comments there\u2019s still a ton of work to do there.","This is a high volume complex operation that has some operational challenges that aren't systemic. Where we have strong leadership and great human resource metrics, we're running great businesses.","We have to stabilize some of these other businesses and start with getting that right General Manager in place, managing partner and then building a great team. So, I think that, I'm very encouraged; the HR metrics are really starting to improve. I'm encouraged that our operation metrics are improving. I'm encouraged that our controls are better today than ever. I'm encouraged that our restaurant is staffed. And I'm encouraged with the new insight that we've really uncovered that we've got a real awareness problem. And an awareness problem is with people within 10 miles of our restaurants. So I'm encouraged that we can solve that. But we're going to solve these problems for the long-term.","We\u2019re going to build a strong foundation and we're going to do it right. This represents less than 8% of our overall business and I'm really resolute in the fact that I want to fix this and fix it right for the long-term. I think this is still a huge opportunity. And as much urgency as I'm putting behind it, I'm more concerned about doing it right.","As far as M&A activity, I use a standard statement. But the management and the board are going to continue to look at opportunities to add to our portfolio when it's appropriate. And I really have no further comment on that at this point in time.","Jake Bartlett","Got it. And I had a follow-up question on your level of incentives and your approach to incentives. And your traffic has been negative the last two quarters at Olive Garden, obviously, outperforming the space significantly.","As you look at that, are you focused more on the outperformance or your absolute level? And I'm kind of wondering how long you're going to -- you would kind of tolerate negative traffic versus kind of trying to insert more incentives to try to drive that positive?","Gene Lee","Yeah. First of all, let's look at the magnitude of the negative traffic. I mean half of the negative traffic that we reported last month is just due to catering delivery. And that piece of the off premise business grows -- we're not giving ourselves any guest counts for that. We're not doing that for multiple reasons. And we could go ahead and change our methodology and have positive traffic if we chose to do that.","I think that when we look at traffic and we look at the overall business, there are going to be times that there's traffic available to you and it's worth driving. There are other times when you look at the business, and you say, I'm okay with losing 10, or 15, 20 guests a week and being able to protect our business model.","And so, I don't think you can just have, let's do everything we can to grow traffic, or let's do everything we can to protect our business model. I think it all has to be done in balance. And I think our management teams and this leadership team have done an outstanding job over the last four years of really balancing these efforts.","Jake Bartlett","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Chris O\u2019Cull from Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris O\u2019Cull","Thanks. Good morning. First just a point of clarification and a question. Is the $5 Take Home entr\u00e9e promotion considered a new off premise transaction, or is it just an add-on to the dining check? And then, Gene, can you provide some more detail about how Cheddar's plans to broaden reach with its advertising? And when we might start to see that investment?","Gene Lee","Yeah. The $5 Take Home is an off premise transaction. And as far as Cheddar's goes, I mean, we're out there testing and learning with different digital vehicles to see and other traditional media to see what we can -- what kind of awareness we can generate with that. So we're out there at a small scale and we'll continue to increase that scale as we learn.","Chris O\u2019Cull","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is open.","Peter Saleh","Great. Thanks. Gene, just a couple of questions on Cheddar's, can we just go back and talk about the guest satisfaction scores, may be direction that you're seeing there? Are those improving, or have those kind of started to go backwards?","And then on the turnover at Cheddar's both manager and the crew level, are those -- how far are those off of Darden's average? How much more work is yet to be done there? Thanks.","Gene Lee","Good question, Peter. Guest satisfaction scores are increasing across the board as we've improved management, employee staffing and there is still opportunity there and I would say that the virgins, the differential between the better operating stores and the one for challenges is still too great and we've got to close that gap down.","As far as turnover, the metrics are still outside Darden norms, but they are inside industry norms for the first time, which is I think is a really good trend. And it's going to take us a while to get them -- hopefully get them to Darden norms, but they are on their way and again inside industry trends at this point in time.","Peter Saleh","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. One clarification first. Gene, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the industry comps continued to weaken and then you did mention -- I'm just trying to gauge whether you think it\u2019s older to tough compare because I think that was what you mention initially as a rationale or whether you do see that there is some sort of change in the consumer behavior, because when you look at past couple of quarters, it seems like the two-year trend on comp and traffic seems relatively stable. So, maybe you're looking at broader industry data that we don't get a chance to see more holistically or whether you think it's again more just the two-year comp compare being more difficult or where there's actual change in the consumer?","Gene Lee","Well, I think that, I think it's a combination of both. I think that's what I was trying to allude to in the comment was that, the industry was facing some tougher comparison, but I think you all talked about that is that overall industry comparisons were little bit more difficult.","But I think, what I was trying to get at is, we were surprised that it went all the way to negative. We thought that our view was to the industry would stay positive in this environment. It may not -- the growth rate would've come back just like, if you look at GDP growth, it's still strong, but it has decelerated. So, we were just I think a little surprised that the industry went all the way back to negative.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Understood. And then just want to talk about Cheddar's, I'm just wondering things like the under-the-hood metrics are getting better and you seem excited about the opportunity longer term. I was just wondering whether frustration on the sales in the short-term might lead you to delay when you would otherwise ramp-up the new unit growth which seem like that was the big opportunity over time, I'm just wondering whether that timeframe might have changed or have been pushed back at all?","Gene Lee","Only the timeframe has changed. I think we've been pretty consistent with our talking point around that is the biggest thing for a new unit ramp-up growth would be human resources and I'm not so sure that I haven't said that we won that battle yet. And so, every time you open a new restaurant, you make that investment, you got to have a great managing partner. And I don't think that we're there at that point yet that we can ramp-up growth. We're still doing five or six a year, which is the right number at this point in time. And I want -- I really want to see the management depth continue to build.","And then when you get to that point that's when you can start to ramp-up growth. But I don't think that's -- we haven't given a timeline to that and I'm going to give a timeline today. I'm focused on really, really getting great managing partners in these restaurants. And I know when we do that our likelihood of success increases dramatically.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. No more questions at this time. Let me now hand the call over to Kevin Kalicak.","Kevin Kalicak","Thank you, Ray. That concludes our call. I want to remind you all that we plan to release second quarter results on Thursday, December 19th before the market opens with conference call to follow. Thank you all for participating in today's call. ","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

These results were available on PR Newswire and other wire services. Now we recognize that most of you have reviewed the fourth quarter earnings results, so we won't take time to go through them in detail once again in an effort to provide more time for your questions. We will offer a line item summary of the P&L, discuss our financial outlook for fiscal 2014 and discuss our brand-by-brand operating performance summary.","With that, let me turn it over to Clarence.","Clarence Otis","Thanks, Matthew. And I'll start by briefly sharing at a very high level our assessment of our business, including our performance last year, fiscal 2013, and what we expect this year, fiscal 2014. Then Brad, Drew and Gene are going to provide more detail on both years and on the fourth quarter last year.","Now as fiscal 2013 unfolded, I think many of you know that we moved with added urgency to address the same-restaurant traffic erosion we've been experiencing since the recession started. And during that time, our traffic erosion had been much more muted than the erosion in the industry, about half as much of a decline as the industry on a cumulative basis. But in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, our same-restaurant traffic decline exceeded the industry's. And when that continued into first quarter this year, we took action on 3 fronts. First, we began to match the competitive promotional intensity around affordability, and that included being more aggressive with our offers and our advertising messages and with our use of tactical support like daily and weekly digital specials. Second, we began to more aggressively address affordability in our core menus, and that included launching with some heavy media support, a new Red Lobster core menu that has a significant affordability component and then also accelerating introduction of new, more affordable core menu offerings at both Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse. And then third, we increased the resources dedicated to reshaping our guest experiences to respond to what guests want beyond affordability, and that meant reorganizing our marketing and operations group and ramping up investment in better digital and other capabilities.","Now reorganizing these functions, key functions, marketing operations involved shifting many tenured leaders into new positions. And because the intent of the reorganization, reshaping the guest experiences we provide, require some new skill sets and new professional experiences, we also added new people.","Now as we look back, the cost of the leadership changes we made was much higher than we expected, and the most significant but difficult to measure cost was that associated with reduced executional effectiveness. As we look back, we also know that many of our promotional core menu affordability efforts involve more margin pressure than initially anticipated. Although as we got better in-market reads of guests' reaction, we consistently made what we think were appropriate adjustments. And these leadership, churn-related and affordability costs were partially offset by some of the initiatives that we launched in prior year and continued in fiscal 2013. And those initiatives are initiatives that we talked about before, and they include continued automation of our supply chain, continued reduction in our water and energy usage and continued implementation of more efficient in-restaurant labor processes and procedures.","In fiscal 2013, costs in these areas were reduced by $13 million, bringing the annualized cost savings from these efforts to more than $125 million since we started down this path 5 years ago. Fiscal 2013 is also a year in which our strong pay-for-performance orientation drove through because with performance that was well below our pre-established sales and earnings goals, incentive payouts from the restaurant manager level on up were well below normal. The overall annual incentive payout for fiscal 2013 was 56% of normal, and payouts ranged from 65% of normal for our in-restaurant management teams to 31% for all the others in our plan to less than 15% for the most senior leadership team, and for several individual leaders, there is no payout. Of course, the below normal overall payout prevented the EPS decline for the year from being even greater than it was.","Now when we look at our same-restaurant traffic results in the third and fourth quarters, we see encouraging signs that we're on the right track. In the third quarter, we matched the industry, although absolute results, for sure, for us and for the industry were not strong. But in the fourth quarter, we were well above the industry, and we had solid growth in same-restaurant traffic.","Looking forward, our sales and earnings goals for 2014 are to drive same-restaurant traffic growth and deliver same-restaurant sales growth that's above what we forecast for the industry, although it is likely that quarter-to-quarter traffic in sales will be volatile given our view that fiscal '14 will mirror fiscal 2013 on a macroeconomic basis. So we expect to see a continuation of the slow and uneven recovery that we've been experiencing for some time now.","From an annual incentive accrual perspective, we will accrue for our fiscal 2014 based on the assumption that we achieve our sales and earnings goals for the year and that as a result, the overall payout will be at a normal level. And the move from a well below normal payout in 2013 to a normal payout in 2014 is a headwind for fiscal 2014 earnings growth that amounts to $0.35 a share. Of course, if we don't achieve our sales and earnings goals for fiscal 2014, the overall payout for the year will again be below normal.","What's most important, in our view, is that we are confident that in fiscal 2014, we will return to same-restaurant traffic growth and to industry leading same-restaurant sales growth. And that confidence is based on the steps we've already taken, the momentum we're seeing and what we're doing to build on that momentum. And renewed same-restaurant traffic and sales growth coupled with solid new restaurant sales growth that going forward is going to be driven largely by a continued expansion of Longhorn in our Specialty Restaurant Group brands is the key to resuming competitively superior shareholder value creation.","With that, let me turn it over to Brad to provide some financial detail about the fourth quarter and about the full year fiscal 2013. Brad?","C. Bradford Richmond","Thank you, Clarence. In the fourth quarter, Darden's total sales from continuing operations increased 11.3% to $2.3 billion, and blended same-restaurant sales for Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse increased 2.2% from strong same-restaurant traffic gains of 3.2%. For the fourth quarter, U.S. same-restaurant sales increased 3.5% at LongHorn Steakhouse, 3.2% at Red Lobster and 1.1% at Olive Garden. And we also saw continued same-restaurant sales gains in our Specialty Restaurant Group with 2.3% same-restaurant sales growth on a blended basis. Fourth quarter same-restaurant sales increased 4.5% at Capital Grille, 1.0% at Seasons 52, 4.3% at Eddie V's but declined 1.7% at Bahama Breeze.","Now let's turn to the margin analysis for the fourth quarter. Food and beverage expenses were 16 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis. The increase in food and beverage expense is attributable to menu mix changes and promotional offerings. Fourth quarter restaurant labor expense were 74 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to lower year-over-year check average and wage inflation. In addition, I should note that restaurant labor expenses were $8 million or $0.04 of EPS, higher than we expected coming into the quarter. That was largely because of less-than-expected productivity as we reversed out some of the early year model changes at Red Lobster that did not work as planned and because the Lobsterfest menu had some additional complexity. We believe that we are past these issues and labor at Red Lobster is coming back into standard this quarter.","Restaurant expenses in the quarter were approximately 100 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis because of the impact of adding Yard House, about 38 basis points there. Since with a restaurant base that's 100% leased, it runs higher restaurant expenses as a percentage of sales than our other brands. And for all of our brands, higher workers' comp, public liability costs added about 24 basis points.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were 65 basis points higher than last year as a percentage of sales, primarily due to increased media and media inflation and mark-to-market of our securities-based employee benefit plans. As discussed in our press release, these plans are hedged economically on an after-tax basis, and we receive a benefit from the hedging that favorably affected our tax rate by over 300 basis points in the fourth quarter. These effects offset one another on a diluted net earnings per share from continuing operation basis, so there is no net impact on EPS.","Depreciation expense in the quarter was 7 basis points higher as a percentage of sales basis compared to last year due to increases in new units and remodels. For the quarter, operating profit as a percentage of sales was 8.4%, and all of this netted to a 12.2% decline in diluted net earnings per share in the fourth quarter.","Now for the full fiscal year, Darden's total sales increased 6.9% in fiscal 2013 to $8.55 billion. This increase was driven by 144 net new restaurants, including the purchase of 40 Yard House restaurants plus 4 new units opened since the acquisition closed, combined with a blended same-restaurant sales increase of 2.1% at the Specialty Restaurant Group, offset by blended same-restaurant sales decrease of 1.3% at our 3 large brands.","On an annual basis, we reported net earnings from continuing operations of $412.6 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.14, representing a 12.3% decrease in diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations. This includes the integration cost and purchase accounting adjustments related to the Yard House acquisition, which reduced diluted net earnings per share by approximately $0.09 in fiscal 2013.","Despite the earnings decline, we once again generated strong cash flows, and given our ability to consistently do so, today we announced an increase in our dividends to $0.55 per share payable on August 1, 2013, to shareholders of record on July 10, 2013. Previously, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share or $2 per share on an annual basis. Based on the $0.55 quarterly dividend declaration, our indicated annual dividend is $2.20 per share, an increase of 10%. Given the diluted net EPS, we expect in fiscal 2014, which I'll talk more about later, this equates to a payout ratio on a forward basis of approximately 70%. While this is above the 40% to 50% payout range we discussed before, we're in the process of reviewing our target range and are likely to take it higher sometime later this year.","Over the last 5 years, we have increased our dividends at a rate of 22% on a compounded average annual basis, which speaks to the consistent cash flows we generate and our intent as we think about the balance between dividends and share repurchase to return more capital to shareholders through dividends.","And now I'll turn it over to Drew to comment on Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse.","Andrew H. Madsen","Thank you, Brad. And this morning, I'll briefly comment on the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter performance at each of our 3 large casual dining brands, as well as their fiscal 2014 strategic priorities. But for competitive reasons, I'm not going to discuss any of our specific fiscal 2014 tactics in detail.","Olive Garden same-restaurant guest counts increased 2.3% during the fourth quarter, and this performance exceeded our estimate for the industry, excluding our brands, by approximately 340 basis points and represents a significant improvement competitively compared to the third quarter, when Olive Garden trailed the industry on traffic by 20 basis points. Same-restaurant sales grew 1.1% and exceeded our industry estimate by approximately 20 basis points, which also represents a significant trend improvement competitively compared to the third quarter when Olive Garden trailed the industry by 260 basis points.","Red Lobster same-restaurant guest counts increased 4.2% during the fourth quarter, and this performance exceeded our industry estimate by approximately 530 basis points and represents a significant improvement competitively compared to the third quarter, when Red Lobster trailed industry on traffic by 70 basis points. Same-restaurant sales grew 3.2% and exceeded our industry estimate by approximately 230 basis points, which also represents a significant trend improvement competitively compared to the third quarter when Red Lobster trailed the industry by 510 basis points.","Longhorn same-restaurant guest counts increased 3.9% during the fourth quarter, and this performance exceeded our industry estimate by approximately 500 basis points and represents a significant improvement competitively compared to the third quarter when Longhorn exceeded the industry on traffic by 120 basis points. Same-restaurant sales grew 3.5% at Longhorn and exceeded our industry estimate by approximately 260 basis points, which also represents a significant trend improvement competitively compared to the third quarter, when Longhorn trailed the industry by 10 basis points.","On a combined basis, our 3 large brands increased same-restaurant guest counts by 3.2% and same-restaurant sales by 2.2% during the fourth quarter. These results are slightly better than our expectations heading into the quarter. And as Clarence said, they reflect the increased urgency we brought to addressing the competitively weak same-restaurant guest count results we saw starting at the end of fiscal 2012, which has involved responding more aggressively to the increasing need that many of our guests have for more affordable casual dining experiences and to the related increase in competitive promotional intensity.","During fiscal 2014, all 3 of our large brands are focused on 3 broad strategic priorities: affordability, delivering our current guest experiences at a competitively superior level more consistently across all our restaurants and evolving the experiences that each of our brands offer in ways that make them more attractive to new guests and for new occasions.","The first 2 strategic priorities are intended to strengthen near-term sales momentum, while the third priority is intended to take advantage of changing consumer realities to ensure our brands remain broadly appealing and relevant in the future. And when it comes to affordability, we are refining our pricing and promotion tactics to reflect what we learned during fiscal 2013. Now this learning will help us more effectively balance guest count growth and check growth during fiscal 2014.","Olive Garden will further strengthen guest satisfaction this year through in-restaurant process simplification. And this work is all about making it easier for our restaurant teams to execute to our standards more consistently across all restaurants. In addition, to regain value leadership in casual dining and broaden appeal at Olive Garden, we plan to add more affordable Italian classics for price-conscious guests, compelling and craveable protein-centric dishes for guests that are willing to pay a little more, new offerings in our popular Lighter Italian Fare platform for health-conscious guests and more daypart-appropriate menu selections and service options at lunch. We also plan to begin the expansion of our remodel program at Olive Garden for all non-Tuscan farmhouse restaurants during the second half of fiscal 2014. Finally, we will significantly slow new unit growth at Olive Garden from 36 in fiscal 2013 to 15 in fiscal 2014 and 5 to 10 new units a year beyond fiscal 2014, allowing our restaurant and leadership teams greater time to delight current guests and build a stronger foundation for pursuing new guests and new occasions.","Red Lobster will address the labor productivity opportunity we experienced during the fourth quarter with incremental training for our restaurant management teams on how to more effectively use our labor management systems and by providing increased operations focused on labor hour and wage rate management. To further strengthen the base business and broaden appeal, Red Lobster will continue to contemporize their experience with a focus on more powerfully presenting several core equities to guests. This will include more up-to-date presentations for several premium-priced and highly craveable signature shellfish plates, the introduction of 2 new craveable seafood platforms, reinvigorating our fresh fish and wood-fire grill platforms for guests interested in fresh good for you choices, as well as optimizing the selections in the popular 4-course feast platform for price-conscious guests in ways that make them more compelling while also improving their margin dynamics. And we will introduce more daypart-appropriate menu selections at lunch. Red Lobster will substantially complete our Bar Harbor remodel program and open one new restaurant during fiscal 2014.","Longhorn has made significant progress over the last several years, transitioning the brand and guest experience from a casual dining roadhouse to a great casual dining steakhouse. We will further strengthen guest satisfaction during fiscal 2014 with a continued focus on improving what guests want most from a steakhouse, steaks grilled at a proper temperature and friendly and attentive service. To broaden appeal going forward, we're working to further differentiate the Longhorn brand and guest experience from other steak alternatives and casual dining. We plan, for example, to elevate culinary innovation with approachable new dishes inspired by fine dining and polished casual restaurants and strengthen freshness and quality perceptions by introducing seasonally relevant appetizers, side dishes and add-ons while also adding more non-steak choices and redesigning the steak panel in our core menu to help strengthen affordability. Longhorn will continue significant new unit growth but at a rate that is a slight reduction versus last year, going from 44 new units in fiscal 2013 to a range of 37 to 40 new units in fiscal 2014.","Now Gene will share a few comments on our Specialty Restaurant Group.","Eugene I. Lee","Thanks, Drew. The Specialty Restaurant Group delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter, growing sales 65%. This growth was a result of our 59 net new restaurants across the group, which includes 44 Yard House restaurants, and blended same-restaurant sales growth of 2.3%. Our sales growth resulted in significant operating profit growth during the quarter.","Total annual sales for the group exceeded $980 million, that's an increase of more than 58% over the prior year and contributed to 66% of Darden's total annual sales growth for the year. This sales growth was driven by annual blended same-restaurant sales growth of 2.1% and our additional 59 net new restaurants. With the acquisition of Yard House and strong same-restaurant sales growth at Capital Grille of 3.3%, the group's average unit volumes have grown 5% to $6.7 million.","We're on track with our three-phase integration -- we're on track with our three-phased integration of Yard House. First, people. We've retained all key operational leaders, which ensures continuity, and these leaders will continue to run the brand. Second, we anticipate full supply chain integration by the end of first quarter fiscal 2014. Lastly, we're in the process of migrating all transactional activity to Darden systems and expect this to be finished in late fiscal '14. This approach enables us to capture meaningful synergies. The Eddie V's integration is complete, and we exceeded our synergy targets. Additionally, we've opened our first restaurant since acquiring the brand in Tampa, Florida, and we're very pleased with its initial performance.","As we enter fiscal 2014, our key priorities remain effectively managing accelerated new restaurant growth while maintaining operational excellence in existing restaurants and ensuring our brand and business models continue to improve and remain vibrant. We will also continue to focus on taking advantage of our strong culinary and beverage expertise to remain nimble and dynamic and drive sales, which involves responding to favorable costs and supply developments that we see on various products from time to time to provide compelling special offers to our guests. We will also continue to add new on-trend menu items and seek ways to improve our current offerings. Finally, of course, we'll remain as focused as ever on improving restaurant-level execution, further elevating the guest experience appropriately in each of our brands.","In fiscal 2014, we plan to open 25 to 27 net new restaurants, including 7 to 8 Season 52s, 7 to 8 Yard Houses, 4 to 5 Capital Grilles, 3 to 4 Bahama Breeze restaurants and 1 to 2 Eddie V's restaurants. We're confident that the Specialty Restaurant Group is working on the right things to achieve our long-range growth targets, and we're well positioned to take full advantage of all that Darden has to offer, including robust supply chain, information technology, consumer insights, finance and other capabilities, and make significant contributions to Darden's sales and earnings growth.","Now I'll hand it back to Brad for the fiscal 2014 financial outlook.","C. Bradford Richmond","Thank you, Gene. For -- our outlook for fiscal 2014 reflects the resilience of our business model in the face of what we believe will be a continuation of what has already been an extended period of well below normal economic growth. In this environment, in fiscal 2013, we generated $950 million in cash flow from operations. In fiscal 2014, we anticipate even stronger cash flows from operations driven by a combination of same-restaurant sales growth, new unit growth and improving underlying operating margins. And after investing appropriately in both regaining momentum and expanding our businesses, we plan to return additional capital to shareholders through an increase in our dividends, which we announced today.","In fiscal 2014, our outlook is based on a combined same-restaurant sales growth for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse of between 0 and plus 2% and combined same-restaurant traffic growth of between 0 and 1%. This includes pricing that is estimated to be approximately 1%. Of course, we will be both above and below these ranges from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter, depending on promotional calendars, holiday shifts and changes in consumer sentiment.","Looking at unit growth, new restaurant plans we outlined means that we expect a net new restaurant increase of 80 restaurants, which is 3.7% unit growth on our current base. And with the timing and mix of our fiscal 2013 openings, this will translate into 4.5% sales growth from new restaurants. Given our same-restaurant sales assumptions, new restaurant expectations and an incremental quarter of Yard House's sales, we anticipate that total sales increase for the year will range from between plus 6% to plus 8%. Excluding the incremental quarter of Yard House sales, the total increase would between plus 5% and plus 7%. With lower new unit expansion, we expect capital spending for fiscal 2014 to be lower than in fiscal 2013. We expect it to be between $600 million and $650 million, which compares to $686 million in fiscal 2013. Included in this capital spending estimate is approximately $15 million in capital dedicated to information technology initiatives that we have previously discussed, which largely involves building the kind of guest-facing capabilities that are crucial given our guests' increasing digital lifestyles.","Looking at operating profit margins from continuing operations, we expect margin contraction of approximately 60 to 80 basis points on a full year basis compared to fiscal 2013. On a percentage of sales basis, we expect to see unfavorability from food and beverage expenses in the first half of the fiscal year as we experience elevated inflation on shrimp due to production issues at some farms in Asia, but this will begin to level out in the second half of the fiscal year as farmers implement solutions they have already identified.","We also expect restaurant labor expenses as a percentage of sales to be higher this fiscal year primarily because we are accruing for normal annual incentive payout following a year where the payout was well below normal. The remaining line items, restaurant expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation expense are expected to be relatively unchanged on a percentage of sales basis.","Looking at food costs more specifically, we expect food and beverage expenses to be higher as a percentage of sales. This is based on our expectation that net food cost inflation will be between 2% and 2.5%, which is slightly higher than what we discussed at our Analyst Meeting in February, primarily because of the shrimp production issues. We have many of our products, approximately 60% of our total spend, contracted through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2014, so we have about 6 months of full visibility on our costs. There's limited coverage beyond the second quarter in part because we believe some of the commodities will experience cost declines from the current levels and we want to be in a position to benefit from that decline and in part because we feel the premiums for future contracts are simply too great compared to what we expect prices will be in the cash market several months from now.","In terms of specific food categories and items, total seafood prices for fiscal 2014 is expected to be higher than in fiscal 2013 because of the shrimp supply disruptions. Seafood accounts for approximately 25% of Darden's total cost of goods sold. Category by category, shrimp is our highest volume protein, and we have coverage of 60% through the second quarter at prices higher than in fiscal 2013. Crab is contracted or purchased at prices slightly higher than in fiscal 2013 with coverage of 100% through the second quarter. And we currently have 40% of our lobster usage contracted or purchased through the second quarter at prices that are lower than the prior year. Beef prices are higher on a year-over-year basis, and we have approximately 60% of our usage covered through the second quarter. Poultry market prices are higher on a year-over-year basis, but we have contracted approximately 100% of our usage through the second quarter. Wheat prices are lower on a year-over-year basis, and we have contracted approximately 40% of our usage through the second quarter. Dairy prices are higher on a year-over-year basis, and we have contracted approximately 40% of our usage through the second quarter. And energy costs are expected to be slightly higher on a year-over-year basis due primarily to increases in the price of natural gas. We have contracted nearly 50% of our natural gas and electricity through the fall in the de-regulated markets in which we operate, and we will be opportunistic about adding additional coverage.","Now turning to labor. As I mentioned, we anticipate that restaurant labor costs as a percentage of sales will be higher due primarily to return to normalized incentive compensation accruals for our restaurant managers and field supervision teams following a below normal payout last year and the cost associated with implementing the next phase of the Affordable Care Act.","We believe that restaurant expenses as a percentage of sales will be slightly favorable to the prior year because of sales leverage and our transformational cost savings initiatives. We anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales will be relatively unchanged compared to prior year. This is despite media inflation in the upper single-digit range and a return to normalized incentive compensation accruals for our non-restaurant teams because these are expected to be offset by sales leveraging from same restaurant and new unit sales growth. But in the aggregate, the annual incentive accruals for 2014 which are in both the restaurant labor and in SG&A lines of the P&L, are a significant factor. As Clarence mentioned earlier, the payout in fiscal 2013 was below normal based on performance. In fiscal 2014, we are accruing for a normal annual incentive payout, and the difference between this accrual and the actual payout in fiscal 2013 adversely affects year-over-year diluted net EPS growth by approximately $0.35. I should note that we have broad-based annual incentives with approximately 75% of the payout at normalized level goes to restaurant managers and field supervisory leaders and the remaining 25% going to approximately 800 Restaurant Support Center employees.","Finally, for fiscal 2014, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 20%, although this will vary by quarter, depending on the timing of certain events. Again, we expect to generate solid cash flows in 2014, which we've done consistently since we became a public company in 1995 and to use this to pay our increased dividend, fund capital expenditures and pay down debt. We expect to pay out approximately $290 million in dividends to shareholders, an increase of approximately $30 million from fiscal 2013.","For the same-restaurant sales assumptions, new restaurant growth plans, costs expectations and headwinds from moving from a well below normal to normal annual incentive payout, we anticipate that reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2014 will be down between minus 3% and minus 5% compared to our reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.14 in fiscal 2013. Importantly, absent the incentive and Affordable Care Act headwinds and adding back the $0.08 of lower acquisition and purchase accounting costs for the Yard House acquisition in 2013, this would translate into diluted net earnings per share growth from continuing operations of between plus 4% and plus 6%.","And now Clarence has some final comments.","Clarence Otis","Thanks, Brad. As I said at the outset, we're confident that we'll return to same-restaurant traffic growth and to industry-leading same-restaurant sales growth in fiscal 2014. And again, our confidence is based on the steps we've already taken, the momentum we're seeing, what we're doing to build on that momentum. And again, we know that renewed same-restaurant traffic and sales growth, coupled with solid new restaurant growth going forward, is the key to returning to competitively superior shareholder value creation.","So with that, we will turn to your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question on the phones comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Clarence, you said that growing same-restaurant traffic was Darden's top priority. And I guess I'm wondering, in what length are you willing to go to achieve that goal? Would you actually be willing to sacrifice and potentially rebase your restaurant-level margins lower at any or all of the concepts to achieve traffic growth, if it came to that?","Clarence Otis","Yes, Michael. We do believe that same-restaurant traffic growth is critical. I mean, that ultimately is the best measure of brand health. And I mentioned and we talked about at our Analyst Meeting that we've seen deterioration in same-restaurant traffic in the industry and at our brands, and so we talked about the period from fiscal 2008 -- our fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2012 with industry decline cumulatively of 20% and our brands declining about half that, 10%. And that's an issue we've got to address. And so we need to do what we need to do from a guest experience perspective, both affordability and the things that we're delivering, to really reverse that trend for our brands and get back same-restaurant traffic growth. And to the extent that, that puts pressure on restaurant-level margins, that's pressure we're willing to accept. Now we've got restaurant margins -- restaurant-level margins that are very high at our brands from a competitive perspective, so we've got some room there, especially at Olive Garden, where the restaurant-level margins even with some of the erosion we've experienced recently continue to be the highest in the industry, as high as Capital Grille. And so yes, we're prepared to accept some pressure on margins at that level to really renew same-restaurant guest count growth.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then maybe as a follow-up specific to Olive Garden and in the quarter. Sales were up 5% with positive same-store sales and then unit growth, but operating profit dollars were actually down as per the release, and profit percentage was down. How much was Olive Garden profit percentage down? And in terms of the operating profit dollars being in decline, I mean, what kind of same-store sales do you need given the investments you're making for that to be a positive number? Or should we just expect that dynamic to continue for a while?","Clarence Otis","Yes. I will let Brad follow up. But the -- we don't get into specifics. But the dollars were down single digit on a percentage decline basis. So we're not talking about dramatic differences. And the operating profit as a percent of sales reflects that. Again, Olive Garden's margins are pretty high. And so we have some room there.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, and I think as you look at our business model what's capable of going forward, I think 2014 is a good example that when you set aside the incentive and ACA-related costs, we're talking about on a check growth of around 1%, pricing of 1%, that we're able to very modestly grow margins. And so yes, we're some around that 1% or maybe even slightly less that we need in pricing given the improvements that we made over time in our cost model, somewhat aided by the transformational cost initiatives that we talked about that allow us to price at a little bit lower level and maintain the margins that we have today.","Clarence Otis","And I would say that, that number that Brad just gave you, excluding those big adjustments, also is a year where we're seeing pretty significant beef inflation that we're not pricing for at Longhorn. And so that has put some downward pressure as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","A question here is on margins. On this type of comp growth that you had this quarter, I would have expected less deleverage. And the restaurant-level margin deleverage was pretty similar on a year-over-year basis to last quarter when comps were really down almost 5%. Both labor and other costs really spiked pretty dramatically on a same-store basis in the quarter. So there was much more than a negative margin mix dynamic going on. It seems as though there's actually a lot of new costs that are entering the model. So if you could just talk of a little deeper on what those are and how you're going to work to improve those dynamics, because I know, Clarence, you keep saying there's a lot of room, but we want to see margins -- try to see what you guys can do to get margins to go higher even despite the fact that they are so high to start.","Clarence Otis","Yes, I would say -- and then Drew can follow-up. I think Brad dimensionalized one of the things, which is compared to where our expectations were entering the quarter. We had labor at Red Lobster. It was about $8 million higher than we thought, and that had to do with a couple of things that he mentioned. One was a little bit more complexity in the menu for Lobsterfest than we anticipated. And the other factor that Brad mentioned was that we were making some adjustments to the model through the year to reverse out some changes that we've made. And there was reduced productivity as we went through that transition. So those we think of as onetime in this quarter, and so that was part of it. And then on one of the other line items, we talked about the fact that we do have to mark-to-market some employee benefit plans that are basically securities based, fixed income securities and equities. And so that takes down operating margin, but those are hedged on an after-tax basis. And so we do get a benefit at the tax level. So there's some geography there.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Now was that in the labor line? Or was that within the 4-wall line? Or was that in G&A?","C. Bradford Richmond","That's -- it's in both places.","Clarence Otis","Depends on which employees. So there's -- some of that -- some of those benefit plans are for restaurant managers and multilevel supervisors, and some of them are for others, and so it winds up in both places.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the last question is just the guidance. So it's a little below what the initial outlook was at the Analyst Day. I'm just wondering, what's really changed in your thinking since? Because I assume comp sales outlook has not gotten worse, maybe, in fact, gotten a little bit better since then. So what is it that's really surprising you that caused you to, on a year-over-year basis, slightly bring down that outlook?","Clarence Otis","Yes, I'd say 2 things. I mean, one is the one that Brad mentioned, which is given the production issues that cropped up in some of the Asian shrimp farms, food inflation costs, about 50 basis points higher, I think, than we were thinking when we talked to you in February. Now solutions have been developed for that, and so we would expect that the farms will implement those solutions and this is temporary, but the fact of the matter is that we will see that in the first half of the year. And then the second is we talked at the Analyst Meeting about blended same-restaurant sales growth for Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse of between 1% and 2%. Our current thinking is a broader range. So we're talking about between flat and 2%. And so although we had a very strong fourth quarter from a comp perspective, the industry was really pretty sluggish. And so we think at this point in the year, as we build plans, we need to be conservative because we have seen a cycle over the last several years where we had some encouraging spring followed by some challenge in summer into the fall, and we have to be prepared for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion with Citigroup.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of the new core menus at Red Lobster and Olive Garden, you previously talked about that it would take some time for those to gain traction with consumers. Did you begin to see that happen this quarter? Or have we yet to see that happen?","Andrew H. Madsen","No, we are beginning to see it have a positive impact on how our guests think in terms of their perception of the brand, particularly around value, and how they're beginning to behave, which we're seeing in traffic. And 2 of the best examples would be the way core menu at Red Lobster has helped address the need for affordability, particularly with their 4-course offering. And a big barrier for Olive Garden to broaden appeal is the need that many guests have for lighter, fresher dishes there. And they've introduced Lighter Italian Fare section that didn't exist and now is getting close to 10% preference. So both of those are having meaningful impact. We're going to build on those things, make them better next year and also address, as I mentioned earlier, the need some other guests have that we think are broad and important for us to get after.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And it's encouraging to see that you're back on track for traffic growth. I mean, can you give us any color as to the type of customers you're seeing coming into the stores? I mean, are they coming in from the lower income groups that you wanted? Are they customers you lost that are now coming back? Or are they just existing customers that are coming back more often because of the changes?","Clarence Otis","Yes, our sense is that given our emphasis on affordability, particularly in promotions and core menu, that we're probably getting a little more impact from the guests that are the most financially constrained and may have cut frequency in the past. But increasingly, we're doing more to let our guests know about other important changes we've made to the experiences that they can get. So I mentioned Lighter Fare at Olive Garden. We've advertised that a couple of times. We'll do that again going forward. So I think increasingly, we're going to see more balance in the guest count growth that we get not just from those guests who are really under financial pressure and need affordability.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two questions as well. First, kind of talking about the discounting side of things and you've talked about matching your competitive promotional intensity of -- just from a peer group perspective. I was wondering if you can do that profitably. And perhaps it would help with a little bit of history because I know -- perhaps close to a decade ago, you guys were very aggressive on the promotional front at Red Lobster and Olive Garden and then really tried to shy away from that because you felt the consumer really end up just coming because of the deal. And I know you held with that kind of more recent thought of less discounting was better. Now that you're being more aggressive again, is it because your hand is being forced or do you think there's maybe a better dynamic versus the prior go around, whether it cost or line item leverage or whatnot? Kind of how do you think about the driver of that need to be more promotional?","Clarence Otis","Yes. I would say and we talked about it a little bit at our Analyst Meeting. I mean, we've got to remember that we've got a highly segmented guest space. And so broadly appealing brands, Red Lobster, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, they bring in a lot of different kinds of guests. They're in the segment of the guest space that has a fairly significant need for affordability, and so we are responding to that. And that is a heightened need compared to where they've been historically given the financial pressures. Those financial pressures include underemployment, stagnant wages. They include other spending priorities from cell phones to some other things. And so for sure, we're being more aggressive promotionally from an affordability perspective because of those guests. And that's really primarily what the promotions are designed for. We're also responding to the needs of those guests on our core menu, trying to add more affordable items. But then we've got a lot of other guests where affordability really isn't the issue. They certainly want value. And they are looking for fair prices, but they are looking for an even stronger experience on a lot of different levels, from quality of ingredients to sophistication of offerings, and we're responding to those as well. But promotionally, I'd say, yes, we tilted promotionally to really talking mostly to that group of guests that are looking for affordability. And when you compare that to history, that's a switch. Our features, our promotions across the year probably had a little bit more balance between price promotions and non-price promotions, but that reflects sort of the state of the economy and where the consumer is.","C. Bradford Richmond","And I'd say going forward, we've got an opportunity to do it more effectively, to do it smarter. So we implemented some new tactics, promotionally that we hadn't used before, largely starting in the second half of fiscal 2013. And we've got a lot of great learning on how to do that in ways that visibly provide guests the affordability assurance they're looking for but also put us in a better position to do that profitably. So that learning is going to be reflected in how we construct and how we communicate and how we present those offers during fiscal 2014.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Understood. And then just, Brad, perhaps as a follow-up or, Clarence, you talked about the dividend payout increase, one obviously yield being industry-leading. But it sounds like you're reconsidering the payout ratio, pushing it above kind of your 40 to 50 historical. But you kind of alluded to share repurchase, which I believe in the past, you've told us we shouldn\u2019t have expected any in '14 anyway because of the Yard House acquisition. But kind of over the next few years, should we now be assuming less and less if any share repurchase? Or how do we think about that? And then how do you balance the payout or dividend with the kind of [ph] reduction or leverage?","Clarence Otis","Yes, we would expect to have a focus over the next year or so on paying down debt. So we've got 2 important leverage measures that we look at. One is adjusted capital, adjusted debt to adjusted capital ratio. And there, we're sort of inside the range that we target. But when we look at our coverage ratio, our EBITDAR coverage ratio, we're at -- we're above the range that we target, and so we're looking to pay down debt and get ourselves back in the range on that particular measure. We would expect to do that reasonably quickly given the cash flows that we've got. And then we have decisions to make about how to allocate the cash that we've got between dividends and share repurchase. We will have a balance between the 2. But compared to where we've been historically, that balance is going to tilt a little bit more toward dividends.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Barish of Jefferies.","Andrew M. Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess just sticking on the promotion and affordability focus, the mix numbers in the fourth quarter were down anywhere from 2% to 4%, depending on the brand, and you're implying kind of flattish mix for '14. Maybe that could be addressed. And I think Drew mentioned that you are refining some of the promotional stuff. So did the fourth quarter reflect maybe a push a little bit too much on price? And if you can kind of just round out some of those comments for us, please.","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes. No. The fourth quarter this year is really -- second half of fiscal 2013 really saw us become more aggressive with promotional tactics that we hadn't used in the past. And what you saw in menu mix each month at Olive Garden and Red Lobster was a year-over-year comparison of very different types of promotions and very different types of offers. And that year-over-year comparison is going to abate next year because we'll be wrapping on these constructs. But in addition, we've got a clearer sense now of what compelling affordability looks like to our guests and how we can design that and communicate it in a way that is less dilutive to check and margin. And that's really -- the combination of those 2 things is what I was referring to. And for instance, we started these constructs at Olive Garden with a 2 for $25 in July a year ago, for instance.","Operator","Next, we have John Glass, Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, Brad, if I could ask you to maybe help us understand the cash flow for '14. You said cash from operations was going to be strong or stronger this year than last year. Maybe I heard that incorrectly, but you're guiding to lower net income. So can you walk down what do you think cash from operations is? And is there a variance from like working capital or something? And just how much cash after that less CapEx do you think you have left for that debt paydown and\/or share repurchase?","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes. As you mentioned earnings -- the earnings cash flow is going to be roughly the same as this year. We talked -- actually, now we're entering the third year of the supply chain transformation. We're on the front end of that. We had to use some working capital to enable the P&L savings that we've gotten. That has reversed. You see that this year, and it continues into next year. And as we open new restaurants they provide working capital to us because we collect our sales pretty much daily and pay on terms. So those are what enables us to look at our operating cash flows, and that will continue to grow. In terms of the balance there, we've talked about the CapEx for next year being in the range of $600 million, $650 million, which is down pretty significantly from our expectations that we had for fiscal 2014 from where we were a year ago. Those are the adjustments that we've made to be more responsive to the marketplace, as well as to ensure that we maintain a strong financial position. And so you look at operating cash flows, it would be, call it, roughly in the $1 billion range, CapEx somewhere in the $600 million, $650 million and dividends that are $285 million to $290 million range. So that leaves that excess cash that would be applied towards reducing our debt and improving our ratios there.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and just the math that I got is about $80 million to $90 million of excess. So it's not a significant portion. I mean, it's a -- that's okay.","C. Bradford Richmond","Not a large portion, but we're still growing our capital base. So we focus more on the ratios. So the leverage ratios and coverage ratios. So you do see improvement beyond just the debt reduction that you're talking about.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And can you speak a little bit -- so conceptually, you've raised the dividend payout ratio or dividend, and therefore, dividend payout ratio to a level that's I don't think typically seen in capital-intensive businesses, 70%. I know you talked about increasing your target, but I'm not sure why that is if that's just a convenience because you've increased your dividend. Usually, when you do that, it signals a reduction to capital intensity of the business significantly. So can you maybe think about -- help us think about how you get your CapEx budget in decline now and in '15 and '16 declines versus the '14 number? Or you're just going to raise the payout ratio and keep that more level, and therefore, you just -- it's a change on how you think about how you use your cash?","Clarence Otis","I think Brad talked about the fact that we are -- the way we think about it, I guess, is that we are less capital-intensive as our base of restaurants continues to grow and generate incremental cash that comes from the new restaurants and the percentage of new restaurant growth on that base declines, we are less capital-intensive. And so we've talked about the fact that we like the portfolio we have. We don't expect to add brands. And so we would see that percentage growth declining a little bit.","C. Bradford Richmond","I think another way to dimensionalize that is our CapEx is -- as we look forward, we talked about our growth expectation is near its peak level. Unit growth is in the range we want it to be at. We have -- Red Lobster will be finishing up the remodel there this fiscal year, pretty much essentially getting it done. We will roll into Olive Garden and the remodel there. So CapEx really isn't going to be expanding, but yet the business is growing. Any improvement in same-restaurant sales. We have strong leverage of that. So that would generate additional cash flows as we look beyond the current year.","Clarence Otis","Yes. Thank you for saying that better. But that's the gist of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Unfortunately, one more on promotions, just getting a little bit more color. So you touched on this a little bit. Over the last 18 months, it looks like Olive Garden has introduced a bunch of things. You mentioned the 2 for $25. I think that was followed by the 3-course Italian at $12.95 and the Buy One Take One at $12.95. The question really is are you set with that collection of so-called value-based promotional constructs? Or do you think we should expect to see more coming? And then as part of that, can you just sort of give us a little bit of an update in terms of your efforts to maybe theoretically reduce the duration or time periods of some of your promotional windows?","Clarence Otis","Well, we don't want to be too specific about the promotional constructs were going to use. You're correct that in the fourth quarter, those are the 3 promotions that Olive Garden ran. And they all address affordability, and they all helped us regain significantly better same-restaurant traffic. We also learned importantly how we can do those promotions in the future better for our guests, how we can do them better for our in-restaurant operations team, which is important learning we're taking into next year. And to tie back to a question that was asked earlier, those are all wrapping on promotions that were very different last year like Passion for Parmesan that didn't have any price point in it and led to a negative menu mix that was referenced. So we clearly are going to continue to focus on affordability in promotions, but it's not all we're going to focus on given the range of guests that we've got and the diverse needs that they've got.","Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just the duration of the promotional windows, again, thinking about maybe shaving a week or 2 off on some of them?","Clarence Otis","Yes, again, that's a level of specificity that, for competitive reasons, we don't want to get into.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco with Lazard.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I have a question, but also, I just want to clarify. I think it was said earlier about the guidance for the comp, 1% coming from price, 1% coming from traffic. I'm curious, is that -- that's an annual outlook. But should the cadence be that the mix should continue to be slightly negative to start the year and then get to flat maybe on a positive mix in the back half to get you to that sort of net neutral on the mix front?","Andrew H. Madsen","I think directionally that, that's accurate because of the timing of the promotion constructs that we introduced in particular, which really started more in the second half.","Clarence Otis","And also, Matt, we talked about traffic being between flat and up 1%. [indiscernible] 1%, which is the top of the range we gave.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I think the mic was just far away. I think that was Clarence talking about traffic being flat?","Clarence Otis","I'm sorry. I said we talked about the traffic range being between flat and up 1% as opposed to 1%, which is the top of that range. We'd love to get hit the top of that range. But right now, our thinking is between flat and up 1%.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then also, I guess at the conference back in February, there was some discussion about the dividend payout ratio and that some credit agencies also look at that as a -- it factors into their overall rating. Are you -- is there a level that you can sort of -- are you not so focused on the credit rating necessarily as you might be more so on maintaining dividend growth? Or can we do both evenhandedly? Can you expand your dividend payout ratio without sort of putting yourself closer to a point where you might be under review by one of the agencies?","C. Bradford Richmond","Well the credit rating is very important to us. But when you look at our dividend, the cash flow that it takes to fund that and compare that with the adjustments we made in the CapEx plus the fact that we'll be growing our operating cash flow from this year, we feel comfortable that we can do both.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just last question. Looking at your guidance, even if you were to wipe out the compensation impact or going back to sort of normal payout ratios on compensation, you're still forecasting margin contraction. Is that, all of that pretty much the commodity picture change? Or is there anything else in there as far as -- is it store opening -- is it more that you're looking for more growth from your newer stores or, I mean, your comp doesn't look to be outside of the range of what historically you've been growing at, sort of that 0 to 2% or -- I'm just curious where you're seeing that incremental deleverage, if it's anything more than just the incrementally worse commodity outlook than what you had back in February?","Andrew H. Madsen","Yes, when you give recognition to the health care transition cost, the Yard House related costs and the incentive accrual that we talked about, our math gets us margins that are flat to up about 20 basis points is what we see. And even included within there is continued investment that's -- a lot of it's hitting the P&L for our technology digital platform that we talked about. So we look at the base model and see that the margins are at least flat or modestly growing as we look to next year in a cost environment, like you said, that's got a little bit more food cost inflation that we originally anticipated.","Operator","Our question comes from Jeff Omohundro from Davenport & Company.","Jeffrey F. Omohundro - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","My question relates to the ACA guidance. Just wondering if you could maybe elaborate on what is going into that number. And just given the uncertainties around the program, how do you think that might evolve or change over the next year?","Clarence Otis","Well, Jeff, there is a lot of uncertainty. And so that number is a difficult number to try to get at because we have to make a number of different assumptions, assumptions about as we offer health care to full-time employees how many are going to take, assumptions about premiums, and we still don't know what premium's going to be. That number will come out this summer. And so it's a tough one to make a guess on. But we think that's about the right guess. There are some excise taxes, surcharges that are pretty clear that are included in that number, but the rest of it is really about assumptions about what people are going to do when they're offered more options than they've been offered before. Hard to say. And a lot of it will depend on how they feel about the new institutions and structures that are going to be up this fall and what the reporting is on how well those are proceeding. So difficult to say, but that's our best guess as to what the range of cost might be this year. We'll keep you posted on it.","Matthew Stroud","All right. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today on the call. We recognize there's still a number of you that were in queue for questions. We apologize we couldn't get to you this morning. Of course, we'll be here throughout the day if you want to give us a call. We'll try to answer your questions at that time. But we wish everybody a safe and happy summer. We look forward to talking to you again in September. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you, all, for attending today's conference.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded, if you have any objections please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you, you may begin.","Kevin Kalicak","Thank you, Gaby. Good morning and welcome everyone. With me today is Gene Lee, Darden's CEO and Jeff Davis, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company's Press Release, which was distributed earlier today and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Today's discussion and presentation may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. A reconciliation of these measurements is available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site. In addition, we are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which will be posted in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at the conclusion of the call. We plan to release fiscal 2016 third quarter earnings on Tuesday, April 5th before the market opens, followed by a conference call.","This morning, following prepared remarks from Gene and Jeff, we will take your questions.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. This morning we want to take time to discuss several things with you. First I'll review our quarterly performance and brand highlights and Jeff will provide more detail on our financial results from the second quarter, as well as our dividend and share purchase plans and I'll provide an update on our outlook for the fiscal year. And then I will close by sharing our framework for long-term value creation. Before we get started, I want to note one point that will help frame our performance. It's important to look at our same-restaurant sales performance on a comparable calendar basis. Due to the 53rd week last year and the shift in key holidays such as ThanksGiving moving from Q3 last year to Q2 this year, we reported same-restaurant sales on both a fiscal and a comparable calendar basis.","Our brand significantly outperformed the industry during the quarter with strong same-restaurant sales growth of 2.9% on a comparable calendar basis and positive same-restaurant sales at each of our brands. We also added 14 net new restaurants which take into account to six LongHorn San Antonio restaurants that were part of the Four Corners Property Trust spin off.","Second quarter adjusted margins showed strong improvement for the fifth consecutive quarter and benefited from both our top-line performance and ongoing disciplined cost management that is focused on non-guest facing elements of our business. The momentum we have built at Olive Garden continued during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew at 2.8% on a comparable calendar basis outperforming the industry by more than 300 basis points. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of growth. In addition, same-restaurant\u2019s traffic was positive on a comparable calendar basis. These results are reflection of our continued focus on operating great restaurants along with developing relevant, integrated marketing initiatives that reach our guests more effectively.","Equally as important is the work we're doing to evolve how our loyal guests experience Olive Garden. During the quarter, we completed the system-wide roll out of table top tablets, which enhances the guest experience. Additionally, we continued our emphasis on OG-to-go sales which addresses a key niche state for convenience. Overall, we have seen fantastic results with a two year growth rate of more than 30% for OG-to-go. Finally, the team at Olive Garden continues to make great strides on culinary innovation, filling the core menu pipeline with a number of exciting new dishes that will roll out in the coming months.","LongHorn maintained strong top-line momentum during the quarter and delivered solid profit growth. Same-restaurant sales grew 3.6% on a comparable calendar basis, outperforming the industry by more than 400 basis points and same-restaurant traffic was positive on a comparable calendar basis. LongHorn's results reflect a relentless focus on in-restaurant execution. That focus was strengthened by continuous simplification of the core menu, which allows our restaurant teams to execute against menu items with the highest guest preference. LongHorn also continues to benefit from the success of its You Can't Fake Steak marketing campaign which drove excitement for two compelling promotions that featured popular steaks at a great value.","Turning to our specialty restaurants, all five brands had same-restaurants sale growth on a comparable calendar basis, led by Bahama Breeze at 5.8% and Seasons 52 at 3.8%. The specialty restaurants brands remain focused on culinary innovation, providing unique guest experiences and creating personal connections with their guests, which was further enhanced by the launch of new Web sites at each of our brands. These five strong brands continue to perform well and increase share, as consumer demand grows from our polished dining experiences.","Before I turn it over to Jeff, I would like to briefly comment on wage rates. There are two key factors at play, steak and local mandated minimum wage increases and the improving employment environment. First, we expect the mandated minimum wage increases which are set to take effect on January 1st will inflate our hourly wage rates by 1.2%. Each of our brands will be impacted differently based on the geographic footprint. The overall impact to Darden is mitigated compared to others even our geographic diversity. Second, low unemployment is creating increase competition for talent, and we expect it will put additional pressure on wage rates in the future. We continue to be well-positioned to deal with this competitive labor market given our strong employment proposition and industry-leading retention rates. Further, we will continue to find productivity enhancements through our simplification erforts that will enable us to effectively manage future wage inflation.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff.","Jeff Davis","Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.54, an increase of $0.26 or 93% versus last year's adjusted EPS. Key drivers of the $0.26 of EPS growth were continued improvement in core operating performance which accounted for $0.27. Favorable settlement of legal matters added $0.05 and is reflected in G&A. This was mostly offset by $0.04 of expense from three restaurant impairments. Additionally, this quarter we began realizing the effects of real-estate transactions, resulting in $0.02 of net incremental expense.","Adjusted EBIT margin expanded 300 basis points in the quarter, principally from leveraging positive same-restaurant sales, commodities deflation driven by dairy and sea food. Accelerated progress with cost and expense reduction initiatives and reduced marketing spend in line with annual expectations. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was a credit of 23%. This was driven by the discreet tax impact of expenses incurred related to the execution of our real-estate transactions. On an adjusted basis, our effective tax rate was 22.9% for the quarter.","Before reviewing our performance by segment, I want to point out that fiscal 2016 segment profit now includes incremental rent and other tax expense associated with the completed real-estate transactions. While the benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit.","Starting with Olive Garden, Olive Garden's segment profit grew $16.6 million, excluding the incremental rent from the real-estate transactions segment profits grew $23.9 million or 17%. This growth was primarily the result of leveraging positive same-restaurant sales, dairy and sea food cost deflation and continued progress on cost reduction initiatives.","LongHorn segment profit increased $12 million, excluding the incremental rent from the real-estate transactions. Segment profit grew $13.4 million or 31%. The growth was supported by leveraging positive same-restaurant sales, improved cost of sales and lower marketing expense.","Fine dining segment profit grew $1.3 million by leveraging positive same-restaurant sales and then finally in other business, segment profit grew more than $9 million this quarter. Reduced food costs and improves labor productivity at Seasons 52 and the Yard House were the key drivers to this quarter\u2019s segment profit growth.","Turning to our real-estate plan. We completed the spent off of Four Corners Property Trust. Additionally, we finalized the sell lease back of our restaurant support center in Orlando and an additional 15 restaurant sell lease backs, bringing the total to 62 with two more properties remaining. We received net proceeds of approximately $631 million related to these transactions. These proceeds in addition to existing cash on our balance sheet were used to retire approximately $1 billion in total debt. $270 million was retired by the end of the quarter and $743 million was retired after the close of the quarter. This strengthens our balance sheet and credit profile and is expected to position us within our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA targeted leverage range of 2 to 2.5 times.","For fiscal 2016 we expect to realize a net $0.08 per diluted share from net incremental expenses related to the real-estate transactions. On an annualized basis, we anticipated net incremental expense from the real-estate transactions to be approximately $20 million to $25 million. This includes approximately $130 million to $135 million from incremental rent and other taxes, a $60 million reduction in depreciation and $50 million in interest savings.","Completing our strategic real-estate plan was a key part of our commitment to deliver value to shareholders and given the current trading multiples of both companies, we believe we have created significant value. And in addition to providing an approximate $7.00 stock dividend value from the spinoff of Four Corners the Board of Directors declared a regularly quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per common share this quarter. This represents a 14% increase compared to the minimum post-spin dividend of approximately $0.44 per share which was disclosed on November 9th.","Darden\u2019s Board of Directors also authorized a new share repurchase program. Within this program the Company may repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock. This combined with our dividend program demonstrates our confidence in the strength of our business and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders.","For fiscal 2016 we are increasing our outlook for same-restaurant sales to a range of 2.5% to 3% and we are increasing our outlook for adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of $3.25 to $3.35. This includes approximately $0.08 per diluted share of net incremental expense related to the real-estate transactions. Finally, we are raising the range for our adjusted effective tax rate to 23% to 25% to reflect a higher earnings outlook. We are not in the place to practice of giving quarterly guidance, but we do expect Q3 and Q4 EPS to be similar not unlike what we saw last year once you adjusted for the 53rd week.","In addition to improvements in our core operating business, we continue realize savings from specific cost expense initiatives. We are on-track to deliver an additional $30 million to $35 million of savings from our previous outlook of $50 million to $55 million for a total of $80 million to $90 million for fiscal 2016. To-date, we have also identified savings of $30 million to $40 million in fiscal 2017 which will bring the total identified annualized savings to $145 million to $165 million which is $45 million to $55 million more than our previous outlook.","And now I will turn it back over to Gene for some closing remarks.","Gene Lee","Thanks Jeff. The Board of Directors along with our executive leadership team has spent the last 12 months developing and implementing several strategic priorities, most significantly our comprehensive real-estate plan. Recognizing that our Company looks different today, I would like to spend a few minutes providing some perspective on our framework for long-term value creation. At its core our business is relatively simple and success for us is really predicated on two key areas. First, we must remain laser focused on executing against our operating philosophy at all times. This means relentlessly pursuing perfection across four key elements, culinary innovation and execution, attentive service, engaging atmospheres and integrated marketing.","Second, we must support our brand by leveraging our four competitive advantages that drive sales and expand margins. These advantages include significant scale, expensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture. Doing so provides a value creating business model that generates significant and durable cash flow to fund growth and return capital to shareholders.","Looking at our framework, our goal is to deliver a long-term total shareholder return of 10% to 15%, which we believe is a compelling and attractive investment for our shareholders. Achieving this type of return will come through a combination of our business performance and returning cash to our shareholders.","Looking at the components of our long-term operating targets, we expect same restaurant sales growth of 1% to 3% driven by the strategy I just outlined, new restaurant growth of 2% to 3% and EBIT margin expansion of 10 to 40 basis points by leveraging sales growth and our scale. This should result in approximately 7% to 10% growth in earnings after tax. It\u2019s important to remember that the growth in the individual components will vary year-to-year based on several factors, including but not limited to the macroeconomic environment and commodities. In addition, we are committed to returning capital to shareholders. We anticipate a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% $100 million to $200 million in share repurchases, which should deliver a return of cash in the 3 to 5% range. This framework is meant to be long-term in nature and we will continue to provide annual guidance as well.","Before we move into Q&A, on behalf of the Darden Board of Directors I would like to conclude by acknowledging the 150,000 hard working women and men across our Company. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they create exceptional experiences and lasting memories for our guests. Thank you for all you do to make our Company successful, we've made great progress together and I look forward to making even more in the New Year ahead.","Now we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Participants, please be advised to limit to one question and a follow-up question. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Company. You may ask your question. ","Brian Bittner","Thanks very much and congratulations on a great quarter, guys. A quick question on the reporting first, just if you could clarify this, so the profit leverage that you got this quarter, should we think of that as leverage you got on the fiscal comps or is that on the counter comp or maybe it doesn't matter, if you could clarify that?","Gene Lee","Brian, it's on the fiscal comp.","Brian Bittner","Okay, okay. I just want to go back to Olive Garden you know I realize that you guys really changed out the incentives for store level managers at the beginning of this fiscal year. Can you just talk about what it is that you exactly did there and how you think that may affect the business performance growth as we look forward?","Gene Lee","Brian, what we did was we simplified the bonus program. The emphasis on our bonus programs have always been sales and profit growth but prior to what -- the big change was we really just simplified it and it's on a -- I would say the framework is on a 3%, 3% for the managers for what they grow same-restaurant sales year-over-year and then they get a percentage of the profit growth also. That is what we were doing in the past it was just much more complicated, today you can walk in the restaurant and the managers understand what their bonus program is, there's also a competitive component of the program today that\u2019s really helpful is that we are basically ranking the profit performance of every restaurant and the ones who are at the top-end of that curve will get a kicker in their bonus. So there's competition amongst the general managers in the system.","Brian Bittner","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Brett Levy","Good morning everyone, if you could do me a favor and just talk a little bit about where you are in terms of unit extension, remodels, refreshes, what do you think you can still do for this year, next year and what kind of sales lifts we should expect?","Gene Lee","Yes I'm not going to comment on -- I will give guidance in June for the following year but let me give you an update on where we are in the Olive Garden remodels. To-date we've remodeled 32 locations at various investment levels. The lift is about 5% in guest counts. We have 13 more that we're going to do in '16. I think the team has done an exceptional job of developing different packages for different sites. We're still reading some of the last work that we've done, but we're optimistic about the lift that we're going to get from these remodels in the future, so it\u2019s been successful, we've done -- one of the thing that's been helping us is that we've gone in to 40 restaurants and we've just refreshed the bar and spent minimum money. However we're getting a 1% lift just from that exercise as we turn that area into a much more functional area. Today in some of our older restaurants it's not as functional and Dave and his team have done a great job of going in, putting in some tables and just making a much more comfortable place to enjoy an Olive Garden meal.","Kevin Kalicak","Any other questions Brett?","Brett Levy","Oh I'm sorry I was not doing a -- I wasn't going to do a follow-up. Any thought on, no I guess we'll leave it at that, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh of Stephens Inc. You may ask your question.","Will Slabaugh","Yes, thanks guy. Just curious if you could speak to the cost savings you mentioned earlier and the addition. So can you remind us now of the general buckets and the size of those buckets for the savings that are going to fall out given the update you made this morning?","Gene Lee","Yes, thanks for your question, the size of the buckets and once again we've increased for the quarter going from -- actually for the year going from 50 million to 55 million, we have increased that to now $80 million to $90 million, that\u2019s about a $35 million increase. The buckets that we talked about was basically food and beverage also in our restaurant expenses and G&A. We did not necessarily break that down if you will in between the three. But what you can see from of the presentation of we have included and I would refer you to may be take a look at that. It's about now -- about a third, a third, a third as to how we see those savings actually being realized during the course of fiscal \u201916.","Will Slabaugh","Got it, that's helpful and a quick call, if I could, just given on what we've heard from some of your peers and seen from some industry data, in that you have concepts reaching across the full-service spectrum, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on how the restaurant consumer is behaving right now. Are there any notable changes to consumer behavior through particular purchases or [indiscernible]. Clearly you are outperforming the industry. So I'm just curious if you have any sort of maybe your rationale for why the industry has seen some slowing here recently?","Gene Lee","Yes I would and this is Gene, I would say that the consumer has been consistent quarter-to-quarter in our observations it is still buying a little less on daily using the whole menu. They are buying appetizers, they are buying deserts, they are buying high value items we are seeing a lot of migration into the 9.99 Cucina Mia in Olive Garden. But an interesting dynamic with that is that over 50% of people that buy that item will add on to it and turn it into a 12.99 entre by adding some protein. So we have seen consistency, obviously I am aware of the slight turndown in the NAP track numbers in Black Box, I really don\u2019t have an idea of what caused that. But I would say that it deals from our standpoint it feels pretty good out there right now. And I like the environment we are operating in and I think the consumer is going to value but value today isn\u2019t all about price. We are seeing consumers do some things in LongHorn where we have got actually we have increased the size of our filet we have got a 10 ounce filet on the menu that\u2019s doing really-really well. And the -- because the consumer is rewarding high quality execution and so we will continue to monitor, but right now I am pleased with how the consumer is behaving in our restaurants.","Will Slabaugh","Okay thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. You may ask your question.","Matt DiFrisco","Thank you. One quick question on the commentary from the call, the script, as well as just your outlook for some potential future business opportunities, one on the marketing side, it sounds like across the board the brands pulled back a little bit on marketing dollars in the quarter and helped out margins. Is that an ongoing thing in the initiative to sort of use marketing dollars more efficiently or is it a reflection that perhaps the marketing dollars are shifting to more efficient, cheaper ways such as mobile apps and mobile advertising or digital rather than TV? And then I do have a follow-up question.","Gene Lee","Okay, Matt. What I would tell you is that the savings in advertising dollars in the quarter was strictly at LongHorn and they were driven by moving from national cable strategy back to a spot market strategy. From immediate standpoint, we are being much more effective with that, we have eliminated a lot of waste that was in the national cable buys and that\u2019s a -- we are into it just about a second or third quarter on shifting on this strategy. So that\u2019s the primary reason for the savings. Following up a little bit on what you are telling but we are migrating dollars from traditional television media into digital and we have continued to find that to be affective. But we are also continuing to find the television advertising is affective. You did see some choppiness in Olive Garden sales to relative quarter as we have started to play a little bit with reduction in TRPs or moving our TRPs from different points in the promotional cycle to understand, if they are really driving consumer traffic and through that promotion we found out at the television is still of a very-very effective medium to drive traffic. And lastly on digital, digital is very effective so we can get very targeted and we can measure that. So that\u2019s why the advertising expenses were down 40 basis points in the quarter.","Matt DiFrisco","Okay, and then shifting gears to Olive Garden or OG on the go there. Where do you think that could be -- top out as a percentage of sales, if you have sort of a goal in mind as well? I mean is this an avenue that maybe you would test delivery with potentially third-party sources out there on a broader more approachable basis than just some select opportunities?","Gene Lee","Yes, good question. We started off this OG to go journey thinking that 20% was going to be a great target, 20% of over 4 million is a heck of a business inside an Olive Garden. We are over 10% now and growing rapidly. We are very in tune to what\u2019s going on with third-party delivery and we are studying that very-very closely. As you know we are also testing our own delivery for large catering parties and having some success with that but we are monitoring the situation we believe that there is going to be some sort of massive change in third-party delivery. There are a lot of people that are playing in that environment today and we are looking for the partner with who we think is going to be the clear winner. But that is going to be an avenue for continued growth in Olive Garden. And I want to keep reiterating the fact that the type of food the cuisine that we serve in Olive Garden travels extremely well and we follow back up with our consumers who use an Olive Garden to go experience, this satisfaction level is very-very high. And so we are excited about this business, our people are doing a great job.","Matt DiFrisco","Excellent, good luck in the New Year.","Gene Lee","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley of Bank of America. You may ask your question.","Joseph Buckley","Thank you good morning. Just a follow-up on Matt\u2019s question, do you sense of how much third-party delivery is going on now in terms of your sales mix?","Gene Lee","Yes and I would say 50% of our Olive Gardens are being covered by some third-party where it is a local deal but I am not sure it\u2019s as productive as it can be, I am not sure that we are a preferred provider in some of those arrangements and so we have got tests, we are working with Postmates, we are working with Google, Hoover is going to come in into play. We are working from a corporate standpoint at 50,000 feet here trying to determine where do we want to step a partnership and where are we\u2019re going to harvest, so how does this all play out. A fragmented system is not going to be the way to go, it\u2019s going to be some sort of national system, we can cover 70% or 80% of our Olive Gardens with one provider so that we can use our scale to drive the best possible financial outcome for both parties.","Joseph Buckley","Okay, then Gene, the long-term a normalized guided I'd ago how you would characterize it for 7% to 10% can't remember now if it was EPS, I think it was EPS growth. Talk about the timeframe for that versus these terrific numbers you're putting up currently?","Gene Lee","Joe, as we look at this portfolio today consider the operating we're using kind of the operating environment that we've operated in the last three years has kind of five that job. What is it that we can do over the next four to five years or so? What we think is available to ask you might we think we can drive earnings after-tax from 7% to 10% and we're going to drive that suit same restaurant sales growth. We think we have the portfolio gives us 2% to 3% new unit growth that we think we can leverage margins anywhere from 10 basis points to 40 basis points depending on what's going on in the environment. We think we can supplement that with a dividend that 50% to 60% of our earnings in a significant share repurchase program to get us into that 10% to 15% EPS growth.","And we think with the portfolio we have today the environment that we're operating in our brands we have some really strong brand that are really well positioned. And when you look back over time when you look back over the last 10 years Olive Garden has outperformed not track by close to 20%. Over the last seven years old one is outperformed Track by over 20% so we really strong brands. We think we can compete in any type of economic environment going to use our scale and are insights to give our brands and advantage in the marketplace. So we think this is a good framework is how we're describing it as a framework. We will continue to give and provide yearly guidance and so we're focused and we believe this is a good framework for us.","Joseph Buckley ","Okay that\u2019s helpful thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line John Glass of Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","John Glass","Thanks good morning. First off, if I could just come back to this quarter in the beat maybe it's a two-part about one is relative to expectations when you the gap on the most and I'm asking on the context offs G&A a court G&A specifically seem to be significantly lower when you string of the one-time items in your adjustments year at 4.4% of sales so I think would suggest a $70 million something which is materially lower than the last quarter and also a year ago. Is that the now ongoing run rate of G&A or where there some one-time items in that were seasonality that affected it?","Jeff Davis","So a couple of things going on with G&A this particular quarter, first off as we had mentioned earlier we had the legal settlement that added approximately $0.05 to G& A. We also would have had as a relates to those impairments offset by $0.04 but that's in a separate line item the G&A rate that we are seeing right now is where we would believe we start to moderate to through the end of the year.","John Glass","And I am sorry, the adjusted 4.4%, that would exclude legal settlement or did it not?","Jeff Davis","That did not. I'm sorry the 4.4% was net of the $0.05 of legal settlement.","John Glass","Got it, okay, so it could be higher in the future, and then on the capital structure side of the business, you had mentioned on a rent adjusted basis you were kind of in a range you were comfortable with. Can you talk about your willingness to use debt in the future? Does your share buyback the you announced today assume just using free cash from the cash from operations or leverage in the future? How do you think about capital structure going forward?","Jeff Davis","I think in the near-term we're going to use free cash flow to do as share repurchase. We will continue to look at the capital structure going forward. Right now our objectives is to firmly get in between the two is to firmly get in between the 2% to 2.5% adjusted debt-to-EBITDA and we're really focused on maintaining our investment grade credit profile.","John Glass","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Tarantino of Robert Baird. You may ask your question.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. Gene, just a couple of questions, first, maybe on your outlook for the second half raising the comps guidance for this year seems like you're feeling very good about the trajectory of the business, but that being said, it looks like the comparisons on an absolute and relative basis start to get a little tougher. So maybe frame up your thoughts on your confidence level and in achieving that implied second half guidance in light of the more difficult comparisons?","Gene Lee","Yes I think the confidence comes from the momentous we have in the business. When we look at what's going on in Olive Garden between the promotional schedule that we have coming, the value and the feedback that were getting from consumers, the trajectory in the to go business, we believe that Olive Garden is set up and has done a tremendous amount of work over the last year to really position that brand to be able to compete effectively. We think that we're getting more effective in our digital marketing efforts.","We're much more segmented and how we're talking to our consumer. We think we've got relative messaging out there, and we just believe that this momentum will continue into the back half of the year is the environment stays the way it is right now. We really think one of the big changes that we made was anchoring every menu with a $9.99 price point at lunch and excuse me $9.99 at dinner and $6.99 at lunch and that provides our guests are looking for value the every day option to come to Olive Garden and it's a full meal at a price that is a great value and one that's extremely competitive in the casual dining segment.","And Longhorns got some great momentum to what I think that business is really focused on improving the overall experience and we continue to make subtle improvements to our menu. We've simplified. We've gone from 125 menu items back down to 100. We're focused on moving a lot of high-volume items and doing it very-very well. We're confident not overconfident but we believe that our hard work is starting to play forward and we've got momentum. The thing that I've been think a lot of you over time is when you get one is a dozen people in the Olive Garden system trying to do the same think they create great dining experiences and that creates great feelings and communities. Olive Garden right now feels as though it's very relevant with the consumer.","David Tarantino","Thanks, and thank you. And then a separate question. On the long-term value creation framework the unit growth requires a step up in the number of openings and I was wondering if you could comment on which brands do you think are really going to drive up the step up as you look at the next couple of years?","Gene Lee","I think we're going to get back on a path where we're opening between somewhere between 8 to 12 Olive Garden's eight years of that will be a big boost to our numbers. Olive Garden still an incredible investment from a new restaurant perspective. There will be some cannibalization but we think Dave and the team have a strategy to identify trade areas that could support and Olive Garden but without so much cannibalization that can't make the returns work is so we think that we could do there. Obviously were going to continue to push on Yard House and we think LongHorn to get back up to the double digits also and so with those types of new restaurant development, we can firmly be in that 2% to 3% range.","David Tarantino","Great that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. You may ask your question.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great thank you. Two questions, one theoretically if you look at of the next 12 months seems that were talking about higher labor costs presumably offset by lower commodity costs. I know over the past few years perhaps most would agree that that was the reverse just wondering which is preferential when you think about it as an operator, you prefer the outlook you have going for versus what you had before commodity me just in the context of your ability to price to offset it would seem like might affect great opportunity to price of the commodity inflation less opportunity do so labor that I'm just wondering how you think about the dynamic of the two of them?","Gene Lee","Good question, Jeff. First they want to clarify that at this point in time, we are not seeing a have a lot of wage rate completion in our direct labor is actually less than it was last to what you're seeing a labor costs is bonus payments this year are up for our managers so I think about the dynamics that you outlined which I think are really a good way to describe the situation that our operating in historically when there has been wage pressure and wage growth, that has been good for the demand of the casual dining restaurant business. What we tried to request variables back, wage growth is much more favorable than discretionary income. And so that in environments where we've seen significant wage growth in casual dining, we've been in environments where we've had stronger demand. And so that's been a more preferable environment then having food inflation and not having wage growth. So I guess the crux of your question is which environment what I personally prefer to compete in is the environment that we are in today.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got you, and just as a follow-up that ties into the cost savings I know you mentioned some of the wage rate inflation. Despite you can Medicaid the cost savings initiatives and I think it's quite impressive that even for this fiscal year you raise your cost savings from 50 to 55 to 8290 where halfway through the year it seems like a big increase that I know you had that chart that shows that they third a third a third between the three components but is there any meaningful bucket. It's just a price that you can see such a big increase what's been the biggest driver to raise not only this year's but effectively you not raise your cumulative numbers pretty meaningfully. Looks like there are just a couple years are you guys are thinking about 59 does camel to our talking about North of $150 million cumulative?","Gene Lee","Jeff, the dynamic there is what's happening is our action capturing some costs quicker than we thought we would. We've had incredible relationship between the supply chain and operations. They have partnered very effectively to move these costs forward into this year and additionally what we've done is we've identified additional costs in the last quarter that we've been able to talk on to \u201917. For me, what's really impressive is the job that both teams our supply chain and our operations teams have done to be able to implement these effectively at a pace that we did think that we could get to and so that's what's really happening here. We're pulling forward and we've identified new ones. So it really wasn't new cost saves that were identified that were pulled into \u201916 they were identified for \u201917. We pulled them for but subsequently we've identified additional once were \u201917. Everything that we're doing I want to reiterate this everything that were doing as transparent to the guest and that every conversation we have around some sort of cost save is the first thing we ask is how does it affect the guest and if it affects the guest comments off the table. So this is all stuff that's not affecting our guest in the guest experience.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got you, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner of UBS. You may ask your question.","Keith Siegner","Thank you and happy holidays everybody. Just a follow-up on that are one of the best questions so we have the wage inflation should be better for demand about the pricing piece of it though right so Olive Garden has been a roughly 1% pricing for the last two quarters a little below the prior trend LongHorn actually is a little puppy trend with a 4Q and one qubit now running in the low twos pulling all these pieces together, how do you think about the pricing? And I asked because one of the most frequent questions we've been getting is, is the industry at risk of losing pricing momentum as we head into next year? So just pulling all of those pieces together how do you see pricing going for the brands and even for the industry? Thanks.","Gene Lee","I think pricing in any competitive environment we're in pricing is going to be cautious. I think we need to continue to price at or below inflation but I think there is a couple of components the way we think about it. You've got to use price effectively on your core menu to help offset some of the inflationary costs you're facing. But how we introduce new products and what price points we introduce new products to create a mix is very, very important. We have been over time been able to use our menu mix as a lever to increase our pricing. As a pullback in some of the heavily discounted a lower price point promotions by moving up a dollar or two, you are effectively getting a positive menu mix begin not really increasing pricing for giving the consumer choice to purchase that whatever price point level they want to purchase that. And so I think as we move forward, I think there will be pressure on our ability to price.","However, I want to come back to what I think is really important in our business which is execution at the restaurant level and if we create an environment where our executing our food, we've got great service and atmospheres a compelling, overall value will be defined by much more than price and we talk a lot about that organization. And that is that we're not going to compete just on price. We're going to create on creating a great experience and the better the experience, the more tolerance you have for pricing. And so that's that were thinking about a. We've got to continue to improve our experience so that we can price effectively and be able to still drive our top-line sales and driver guest counts.","Keith Siegner","That\u2019s good perspective thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Greg Badishkanian","Hi good morning this is Greg on for Karen this morning. With tablets rolled out at Olive Garden do you have any data of how it might help serving your response rates maybe satisfaction scores or tablet versus non-tablet users check or the number of e-mail club sign ups?","Gene Lee","Yes great question we are excited about what the team did to be able to get this rolled out as quickly as they did. This has been incredibly positive for our guests. Guest satisfaction scores are really high with people who use the tablet. The other thing and you mentioned it that\u2019s been very positive is the fact that the e-mail club sign-offs, we are getting 80% of the guests that interact with the device are signing up for the e-club and over half of those are new sign ups. So we continue to build this database that allows us to communicate more effectively with those guests. Game revenues have been stronger than we thought and our servers are embracing this as an enhancement to creating a better dining experience for the guest. But most of all I think as we have said that one of the biggest upside surprises of this was our ability to get instantaneous feedback on the servers\u2019 experience that that server is providing, it allows us to coach and help those servers become more effective. So Ziosk on our tabletop tablets has exceeded our expectations and now we have spent the last nine months working to get those on the table. Now the management team needs to develop plans to further enhance their productivity and how they create a better dining experience for the guests and how they merchandise on that device, how they advertise on that device and how they keep the games relevant and up-to-date so the consumer wants to interact with them.","Greg Badishkanian","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull of KeyBanc. You may ask your question.","Chris O'Cull","Thanks good morning. I had a question regarding the long-term framework Gene should we assume there are no other strategic options that are being considered at this time such as brand divestitures?","Gene Lee","No our primary focus right now is running the business and executing at a very high level and I am really proud of the work that the team has done over the past year. Our management team and our Board will sit down and regularly evaluate alternatives we have to manage our business more effectively and to be able to achieve our financial goals. But as we think about this framework this is within the current portfolio it\u2019s something else with the change we will adjust the framework.","Chris O'Cull","Okay. Fair enough and then can you give us some more color on what future productivity enhancements you mentioned that you plan to implement to help mitigate wage inflation?","Gene Lee","Yes it\u2019s going to be all based on simplification. I believe overtime our menus and process and procedures have just become too complex. And both Olive Garden and LongHorn have done a great job and initial efforts to continue to simplify but when I look at who I really admire in this business, it\u2019s folks who are -- have real simplified operations the execution level is designed in a way that simplified that allows for the product to be delivered at a really high quality level. And so we are going to continue to push to simplify our menus to ensure we have the right range of menu products on our menu. But more importantly behind that, that as we develop the recipes and we think about how we operate inside the restaurant, have we made them as simple as we possibly can while increasing the quality of the menu item itself. And I believe that's where this future productivity enhancements.","Chris O'Cull","Okay, great and one last one. Jeff can you remind us what debt remains outstanding and the rates on each of those notes?","Jeff Davis","Yes, the remaining debt would be approximately $450 million spread between two tranches of long-term debt, the 35 bonds being 150 million and the 37 bonds being roughly 300 million.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Ma'am you may ask your question.","Sara Senatore","Thanks, just a couple of I think follow-ups. The first is on just overall competitive environment, it feels like what you're seeing is different than a lot of others and in particular we've heard some pretty big competitors say they're going to get more aggressive on value whether it's price point value or kind of bundled value. Have you seen that and has it affected your business at all, it certainly sounds like you don't think so but just trying to gauge whether it's already started manifested and you feel like you're inflated or not, you haven't yet seen what the, a big tick-up in aggressive kind of price and value competition. And then I have another follow-up on margins please.","Gene Lee","Okay, Sara what I'm seeing or what we're seeing is that yes our competitor set is getting a little more competitive and going back to some of the tactics that were used three or four years ago with bundles, and we know what we're monitoring it, we're watching closely what others are doing obviously is they're watching what we're doing. But we're focused on value, just not price. And that's where we're having our most success right now and especially in Olive Garden we're able to offer our consumer great value and it starts with soup, salad and bread sticks. And I think that really creates a value gap and the consumer's telling us through our offers that they're not that interested in the bundles. We had actually an interesting dynamic in the fall where we never any possible and we actually saw Cucina Mia actually have a pretty good preference through that promotion when in fact we thought it was going to basically go to nothing and that tells us that the consumer is more interested in ordering what they want to order. They want to be able to customize their order versus being told this is what I have to order to receive value. And there's so much value on our menus. So we're monitoring it and we'll stay on top of it.","Sara Senatore","Thank you, that's very helpful. And then on the margins, you know you\u2019d said you're capturing cost more quickly than you thought you would. Yet if I look at the restaurant margins they're largely in line with consensus maybe not with what you expected but the beat you know again seems to be below that line. So I guess that the two questions are, is the cost of it sort of incremental cost days is that more heavily weighted to the back half of your fiscal year, as opposed to what we've seen in this quarter and second are there inflationary pressures that you didn\u2019t expect that might be offsetting those incremental cost saves because again the restaurant margins look pretty consistent with what I think many of us thought they would be?","Gene Lee","Yes a couple of things here Sara, first remember that we had rent in the restaurant expenses that wasn't planned to be there from the real-estate transaction which was a big offset to some of our restaurant expenses. We picked up 60 basis points in restaurant expenses throughout the quarter, we picked up 110 at the Food and Beverage line so there was some consolidation there and we're getting some pretty good savings in G&A so it's being spread amongst the buckets. The rent -- the restaurant expenses when you adjust for rent would be a lot more significant than 60 basis points.","Sara Senatore","Okay, so it's not the case that these cost savings are going to be offset by unexpected inflation and I think many of us did adjust for rent so just trying to gauge whether anything else besides that may have been a headwind that sounds like you're pretty much able to benefit from the entirety of the cost saves that you're identified? Okay.","Gene Lee","We're giving you on a cost save a net basis not what we are -- because we are investing some of this money back in fact into a savings back into the business but we're giving you a net number.","Sara Senatore","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Penney of Hedgeye Risk Management. You may ask your question.","Howard Penney","Thanks so much, I have two questions, one can you just comment on your process of a new unit openings relative to the prior regime and what kind of returns do you expect and I mean in the past obviously that didn't work out too well for them so just kind of your philosophy on returns and new units and that process going forward and then and to follow-up on a previous question about the portfolio, will you rule out making acquisitions to add to your portfolio? Thanks","Gene Lee","Good morning Howard, our philosophy on new restaurants is that we want to exceed our cost of capital which we have as approximately 9%. We are looking at a risk adjusted return on investment I would say that from a process standpoint we have established the committee that oversees the investment in all new restaurant properties. I look at -- I personally look at every restaurant property that we are going to make an investment in. And then we talk about it with the brand presidents and our development department and we are using our collective knowledge of developing restaurants for 20-30 plus years to ensure we are making a best possible decision. More importantly on new restaurant performance, we have a detailed tracking methodology from month one on every new restaurant that we open and I get -- I personally get that report every 30 days to understand what the performance is and there is the appropriate pressure on our operating teams to ensure that these restaurants are performing at a high level. And so I think that\u2019s really what's different today lot more engagement at the senior levels, lot more follow-up and we are reacting quickly when they have a restaurant that is not performing. As of now all of our restaurants and all of our classes are performing above the required return on investment. As far as the portfolio question goes, as I have been saying we are not going rule out anything but - we will continue to meet with the management team and the Board and we will evaluate all of the alternatives that are there for us to create value for our shareholders.","Howard Penney","Which includes potential acquisitions?","Gene Lee","It will includes everything.","Howard Penney","So can I Just sort of, just going back to the previous question about units, how was is it done in the past of just out of curiosity more than anything else?","Gene Lee","And I am not much sure. I want to define the process in the past, I think what I would say it was handle a little bit more at the brand level than -- and it's still a brand level decision I am just heavily involved in.","Howard Penney","Okay thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","David Palmer","The protein players include things that these costs are going to be going down for the next few years, one supplier was saying that it's going to be the most meaningful multi-year move in terms of the beef cycle since the early 90s what do you think this will mean for Darden does this mean that the supermarket becomes more competitive essentially with eating and there is more protein-oriented deals from competitors and it's all a little bit more of a nice side ultimately sales are less? Or do you think this is more of a tailwind for margins and Darden earnings ultimately? Thanks.","Gene Lee","Good morning David. So here is what I think about where we are in the beef market, beef has -- the animal itself has been declining in price, middle meats continue to be strong, we haven't seen that much decline in the overall cost of the middle meat which you strips and aligns the short lines and such. We have seen some weakness in ground beef which is really good for the hamburger players. We do expect there to be some tailwinds, we do expect to be able purchase beef in a deflationary environment for the next couple of years, as the herds continue to build and the cycle starts to change. I don\u2019t believe that beef is going back to levels that it was at 10 or 15 years, I do believe it's coming down year-over-year. But beef is still going to be a very expensive commodity, in comparison to the other options. Now, does some of this beef get back in the retail maybe but I am not sure. I still believe that a steak, people come to a steak house because a steak house has the capability of preparing its steak in a way that they can't at home and they are much more comfortable making that purchase that more expensive purchase and trusting that experience to professionals who cook steaks every single day. So will there be a little bit more pressure from retail if this pulls back, yes however, I see this is a positive tailwind from primarily LongHorn and therefore a tailwind for Darden.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason West of Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Jason West","So Gene you had mentioned that you guys saw some choppiness during the quarter at Olive Garden as were generally testing some different levels of TV advertising, can you talk about what was going on there and what you learned from that? And was there a material change in the TV leaks during the quarter and how you are thinking about that going forward?","Gene Lee","Yes a couple of things at play here. First of all, Never Ending Pasta Bowl started a couple weeks later on a calendar basis than it did at the prior year. We didn\u2019t heavy up as much on the TRPs on the front-end to see what would happen if we took a promotion that everybody knew and understand and we didn\u2019t load it up with TRPs. What we learned in that is that the TRPs still matter and taking off a promotion with a little up to heavy weight does get things going a little bit quicker. So we were trying to go in with a more balanced approach in a few less TRPs and try to switch some of that into digital. Digital, throughout the quarter, our digital efforts were much more targeted and one of the things that we are trying to do is we are trying to get into these shorter redemption periods to understand how quickly we can get a message out there and a get a consumer to act. The consumer dynamic is changing dramatically and how they use incentive to come in to the restaurant. It\u2019s getting at the point where if it has any age on it at all, it\u2019s forgotten. And so what you are seeing us try to do and understand is, if we put a message out for a couple of days and then we talk to a guest and we know this guest likes this offer what\u2019s the likelihood of them utilizing that offer. And we continue to learn and so when we talk about data insight, that\u2019s where we are really creating some great capabilities.","Jason West","Okay that\u2019s really helpful. And then one other on, you guys have mentioned that you tried out have some bar remodels that were pretty minimal expense that had a nice lift on I guess 1% with some comps. Is that something you think you could move quickly on going forward and maybe would do a separate for the full remodel program or is it something that would be sort of a one-off here and there situation?","Gene Lee","No .Great question Jason that is something that we believe that we can continue to do. We are not doing anything in these bar remodels that we would have to undo when we would go in and do more of a floor refresh in the restaurant. So it\u2019s just we have restaurants out there where that center dining area in the bar is just not very comfortable and the team can get in there for minimal amount of money make it much more comfortable to have a meal and it becomes very -- all of a sudden becomes very productive on the high volume nights. And so Dave and the team are going to continue to do some more of that here as we move into \u201917 and again I will give you much more guidance on that in June.","Jason West","Great thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler of CLSA. You may ask your question.","Diane Geissler","Good morning and thanks for the question. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the remodels and it\u2019s really from the perspective of capital allocation. So it sounds like you are planning to open more new units, increase your dividend, increase your share repo. So where does the investment behind remodeling fit within the overall capital plan and maybe you could just frame it up a little bit in terms of your how the costs I know you have different packages that you can utilize at different store basis but how we should be thinking about the range of potential spend on a per unit basis?","Gene Lee","I will start with the range on a per unit basis. It\u2019s anywhere between 250 and 450 depending on the size and the age of the unit and it also has a little bit to do with once we start opening up walls and moving things around what we might find in some of these 20-30 year old restaurants. As we think about this in our capital plan, we have set on our slide in the deck we have got 145 to 170 designated this year for our refresh and our maintenance cap. We believe we have ample capital to be able to both increase new units slightly and continue to reinvest in Olive Garden over the next two or three years. And we will give you some more details in June on the exact cap expenses, capital expenses for fiscal \u201917.","Diane Geissler","Okay great thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG you may ask your question.","Peter Saleh ","Great thank you. I just wanted to circle back on the tablets. A couple of things, are you seeing any throughput of benefit from the tablets of the some of the higher volume locations on Friday and Saturday night?","Gene Lee","Yes good question we are seeing Peter we seeing six to seven minute decline in the overall table turn. So something that was a minute seven now down to a minute -- one hour and seven minutes and now down to an hour. So we are picking up seven minutes. Primarily that savings comes primarily on the backend. However as the consumer becomes more comfortable with it, it will pick sometime in the front end too.","Peter Saleh","Excellent and then just the implementation of the tablet, is that helping to drive any of the cost savings that you are forecasting either later this year or into 2017?","Gene Lee","No, it is service enhancement we are trying to improve the quality of the experience.","Peter Saleh","Excellent thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Andrew Strelzik","Hi thanks for taking the question. We have seen on a two year basis the LongHorn traffic decelerate a little bit here and you've already even asked about a step up in promotional activity and the value equation at steakhouses lower beef prices, it doesn't sound like you think those components are really playing a role. So what would you attribute that to or do you think it's kind of much ado about nothing?","Gene Lee","I do -- I think we've backed off a little bit on our lower price point promotions. We're trying to get back off the 11.99 six ounce top sirloin promotional activity. Some of that activity wasn't as profitable as you probably would have liked so I think it's -- in this business there's some slight pressure there but nothing to be concerned about. I think you've seen that in the margin improvement too as we back off some of that stuff.","Andrew Strelzik","Got it, okay, great thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Anderson of Maxim Group. You may ask your question.","Steve Anderson","Yes, I wanted to ask about any kind of regional discrepancies you saw in your data and I wanted to also point out the -- I guess the what you saw in the increase at Capital Grille probably less than maybe some of us are looking at and I just want to see if you see any broader trends in the higher end steakhouse category that points to deceleration in business trends.","Gene Lee","Yes Stephen, we're seeing, good question, we're seeing some weakness in Texas in both Capital Grille and Eddie V's, some of our other competitors have noted. We've had in Cap Grille we've had a couple big restaurants that have had some significant competitive intrusion, we've also had some other onetime events that were significant in the quarter that won't happen again that affected same restaurant sales for Capital Grille. These brands are well positioned, they're executing at extremely high level and I'm confident that they will continue to take market share in the future.","Steve Anderson","Right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Duvick of Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Todd Duvick","Yes, good morning. Quick question for you on the balance sheet, you've been very busy there and have done a really nice job of taking down the debt. You do have two bonds outstanding with relatively high coupons and I'm just wondering are you considering liability management for that to potentially reduce your coupon, is that something that you're looking at.","Jeff Davis","No, not at this time, we're not looking at doing anything additional to what we have already done.","Todd Duvick","Okay. And then I guess just related to that, with the share buyback program that was announced today you do have an elevated cash balance as of the most recent quarter. Can you tell us and I think some of that was probably used to take down some of the debt. Is there a minimum cash balance that you like to run with to keep on hand for working capital purposes?","Jeff Davis","As you mentioned yes, at quarter end we had a elevated cash balance and as I\u2019d mentioned we\u2019ve actually, surely after the quarter paid down approximately $740 million of additional debt, as relates to minimum cash balance we do take that into account as we think about running the business and that's in a range of approximately $100 million.","Todd Duvick","That's helpful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Joshua Long of Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Joshua Long","Great, thank you for taking my question. I appreciate all the color on a lot of the restaurant level initiatives that have been going on, a lot to get excited about there but I was curious maybe we could take a step back and talk about the opportunity for your branded products at the grocery level in the CPG category and maybe perhaps an update there or at least a recap in the opportunity to expand that into new products and your skews going forward?","Gene Lee","Josh, we have a small presence in the CPG market primarily Olive Garden salad dressing, it's a strong performer and does very well, at this time we are not pursuing any other alternatives or options with CPG.","Joshua Long","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, no question at this time. [Operator Instructions]","Kevin Kalicak","Any more questions Gaby.","Operator","There're no questions at this time.","Gene Lee","All right, well thank you everyone for your participation in Darden's second quarter earnings conference call this morning.

Your lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question and answer session. [Operator instructions]. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. ","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.","Kevin Kalicak","Thank you, Sue. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2019 third-quarter earnings on March 21st before the market opens, followed by a conference call.","This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights, and Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from the second quarter and update our outlook for fiscal 2019 before we take your questions. As a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated Knapp Track excluding Darden. During our fiscal second quarter, industry total sales growth was 2.1%, industry same-restaurant sales grew 1.2%, and same-restaurant guest counts decreased 0.2%. ","Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we had a solid quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.97 billion, an increase of 4.9%, same-restaurant sales grew 2.1%, and diluted net earnings per share were $0.92, an increase of 26% from last year's adjusted earnings.","As industry sales continue to improve, we made the strategic choice to further reduce our incentives during the quarter, recognizing it would likely put pressure on our same-restaurant sales and traffic. This resulted in our gap to the industry narrowing. However, it enabled us to build a stronger guest base and contributed to our margin improvement, which Rick will discuss later.","We continue to focus on the relentless execution of our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service, and atmosphere and strengthening and leveraging our four competitive advantages. Olive Garden had a solid quarter, which resulted in its 17th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 4.9%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 3.5% and 1.4% growth from new restaurants. Same-restaurant guest counts declined 0.8%, which was a direct result of reduced incentives during the quarter. Check average increased 4.3% this quarter, driven by 1.9% pricing and 2.4% menu mix. Menu mix was driven primarily by shifts in consumer preference and, to a lesser extent, a price increase for Never Ending Pasta Bowl and a reduction in incentives.","During the quarter, Olive Garden's restaurant teams flawlessly executed their two most popular and strongest value promotions of the year: Buy One, Take One and Never Ending Pasta Bowl. Never Ending Pasta Bowl was supported for the fifth year in a row by the sale of the Olive Garden Pasta Pass, which once again met with enthusiasm and media buzz. Much of this excitement was driven by the introduction of the Annual Pasta Pass, which entitled 1,000 annual passholders to 52 weeks of Never Ending Pasta, resulting in all the passes being claimed in under a minute.","Overall preference for Never Ending Pasta Bowl and value ratings were strong, even though the price was increased for the first time in five years. Olive Garden's off-premise business grew 10.3% and represented 14.6% of total sales for the quarter. They continue to focus on providing a great takeout and catering experience for their guests. I'm very pleased with this performance and their continued progress in this area.","Finally, the Olive Garden team made investments to strengthen everyday value. First, they redesigned their menus to more prominently showcase two everyday value platforms: Unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks and the Cucina Mia create-your-own pasta. Second, they enhanced the value of one of their highest-preference entrees -- chicken alfredo -- by adding 50% more chicken. And finally, they launched their 5 for $5 beverage platform. I remain excited about the strategic investments the Olive Garden team is making to compete effectively while continuing to highlight their everyday value proposition.","LongHorn Steakhouse also had a solid quarter. Total sales grew 6.4%, driven by 3.5% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.9%, their 23rd consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. The LongHorn team continues to make the right investments in the business, focused on quality, simplicity, and culture. That is why they have gone to the extraordinary lengths to continually train, test, and certify their grill masters, which has significantly improved their steaks' Grilled Correctly scores. They also continue to look for ways to simplify their operation. This quarter, they worked to reduce complexity in their recipes and improve culinary processes to ensure their team members are able to execute every time.","Finally, strengthening LongHorn's unique culture is critical to executing this strategy. Their senior leadership team just concluded field visits with every manager in order to solicit feedback on how they can improve their guest and team member experience. These investments have resulted in a higher level of execution in their restaurants, which drove strong sales and profit performance during the quarter. This also led to all key guest satisfaction measures significantly exceeding the prior year.","Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen total sales declined 1.4%, driven by a same-restaurant sales decline of 4%, which was partially offset by sales growth in new restaurants of 2.6%. While I am disappointed by the lack of progress in the top line, I am pleased with the progress that Cheddar's management team was able to make during the quarter. This included making a significant operational realignment to unify three different cultures with inconsistent operating procedures. As a result, the majority of their restaurant operators received a new leader, which created a short-term disruption, but was necessary to position Cheddar's for long-term success.","I'm also pleased with the progress against the three strategic priorities: Staff to win, master the tools, and standardize and simplify. To support team members staffing, they have introduced consistent and more effective methods to attract, hire, train, and retain the right talent, and their teams have made meaningful progress increasing their staffing levels. Today, the restaurant management teams are using our proprietary tools to forecast their business with much more accuracy, enabling them to staff their restaurants properly to better serve their guests.","And, we have introduced standards to create consistency across the brand. For example, during the highest-volume periods, restaurant managers are now positioned properly with one manager at the host stand, one managing the dining room, and one managing the kitchen, resulting in much better throughput. With this laser focus on the strategic priorities, they are seeing higher guest satisfaction scores, and those scores continue to improve each month, and in time, they should see better team member and management retention levels.","The Cheddar's team is also working on culinary process improvements that we phased in over time. These efforts will lead to increased quality, consistency, and speed of service. There's still work to be done at Cheddar's to simplify the operation and consistently improve restaurant-level execution. They have a strong management team in place, and as they continue to implement our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy, they will make significant progress throughout this year and years to come.","Before I turn it over to Rick, I want to close by saying thank you to our 180,000 team members. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they create exceptional experiences and lasting memories for our guests, so on behalf of the management team and the Board of Directors, thank you for all you do to help our guests celebrate this time of the year and for making our company successful, and I wish all of you a wonderful holiday season. Rick?","Rick Cardenas","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we were pleased with our results in the second quarter, as total sales grew 4.9% from the addition of 40 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.1%. More importantly, with this sales growth came strong flow-through, resulting in expanded margins for the quarter, with restaurant-level EBITDA growing 40 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.92 grew 26% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. We also returned a total of $154 million to our shareholders this quarter, paying out $93 million in dividends and repurchasing $61 million in shares.","Turning to the margin analysis for the quarter, food and beverage costs were favorable by 40 basis points as pricing of approximately 2% and cost savings net of investments more than offset both commodities inflation of under 1% and the unfavorable impact of the new revenue recognition standard, which we detailed in our last earnings call. Total labor inflation of over 3.5% and incremental workforce investments drove restaurant labor 50 basis points higher than last year despite continued sales leverage and productivity gains. As a reminder, Q2 was the final quarter of the incremental workforce investments we introduced last January.","Restaurant expense was favorable 40 basis points, as sales leverage more than offset minimal inflation. In fact, our total restaurant expense in dollars per operating week were equal to last year. Marketing expense was favorable to last year by 20 basis points, driven by sales leverage, all resulting in restaurant-level EBITDA margin of 16.7% this quarter, 40 basis points better than last year.","Below the restaurant level, general and administrative expense improved 20 basis points, as we lapped an unfavorable legal settlement from last year, which was partially offset by incremental workforce investments. We recorded $2.7 million of impairments during the quarter, which is included in our $0.92 diluted EPS. This impairment is related to a planned Olive Garden restaurant relocation and one future closing, also in Olive Garden. Taxes were favorable to last year as a result of tax reform. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.3%, which is higher than our annual expectation of between 10% and 11%.","Turning to our segment performance, Olive Garden, LongHorn, and the Fine Dining segment all grew sales, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurants. Segment profit margin increased in each of these segments with strong flow-through and cost management, even after the incremental workforce investments.","Sales for our Other Business segment grew 3.6%, driven by net new restaurants and incremental franchise revenue related to the adoption of the new accounting standard. Segment profit declined 110 basis points in this segment due to margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales, incremental workforce investments, and the adoption of revenue recognition.","In this morning's press release, we increased our fiscal 2019 same-restaurant sales growth outlook to approximately 2.5% from the previous range of 2% to 2.5%. We also increased our EPS outlook to be between $5.60 and $5.70 from the previous range of $5.52 to $5.65. All other metrics in our financial outlook remain unchanged. Finally, and most importantly I want to wish all of our 180,000 team members and each of you a happy and safe holiday season. ","Now, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] ","Our first question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. You may go ahead.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. Gene, just a question on the Olive Garden traffic and mix. I know you mentioned that Olive Garden made a choice to reduce the incentives this quarter, so could you elaborate on what exactly that means? And I think this quarter was one of the first in recent memory where Olive Garden did not outperform the industry on traffic, and I know that incentive adjustment might have been part of it, but just how do you think about that gap versus the industry and the importance of maintaining a positive or stable gap on the traffic side? And then, I have a follow-up related to the mix.","Gene Lee","Okay. We headed into the quarter feeling like the industry was in fairly good shape, and we made the strategic choice to reduce our incentives, which primarily was coming through email. We ran 16 fewer weeks during the quarter. That included some weeks we had multiple offers out there last year. We really didn\u2019t have any offers out there this year. We felt it was with the demand environment being strong, it was a good opportunity to remove some of that incentives so that in the future, if needed be, we could add it back in.","We also thought it was an opportunity to really, as we think about growing our sales profitably, we just felt like the environment was right, and we can basically get to the guest count for the reduced incentives, which was more than what we were down for the quarter. So we would have, if we had the same incentive level as we had the prior year, which has been consistently what we\u2019ve been running, we would have beat the industry. So we\u2019re not that really concerned about that. What we\u2019re really focused on is building a really healthy guest base and trying to ensure that we create some opportunity in the future if need be to put back some of these incentives into the business.","I will add that I think the overall industry continues to perform well. The dynamics are changing. Large, nationally advertised brands are taking share with the advertising budgets being increased, and the industry is growing more promotional as check averages growth is less than 2% for the first time in a while. It will be interesting to see whether these large brands will continue to give up margin to advertise and promote in the intensity they\u2019ve been promoting at.","David Tarantino","Yeah. And, that\u2019s maybe the nature of my follow-up, Gene. On the Olive Garden, check growth has been fairly substantial for the last two quarters. And I think I understand the dynamics there. But are you seeing anything in your data that would suggest the change in the perceived value equation at Olive Garden in a negative way related to that check growth?","Gene Lee","No, we\u2019re seeing the exact opposite, David. We\u2019re seeing value go up. So, just a little more color on the mix change, we did make a couple menu moves halfway through the quarter to mitigate the mix growth. However, our investment in the chicken alfredo dish, we saw some significant increase in the mix there, and because the promotional calendar had the value promotions there, we saw a lot of trade up out of the promotional items into that item. We also saw -- with the increase in Never Ending Pasta Bowl from $1.00, we saw some trade out of that into regular higher-priced menu items, and then when you throw the dollar on, that had a little bit of contribution to the mix, and with less incentives that also contributed a little bit to the overall mix. So, we're seeing our value scores increase.","I think the consumer is healthy; they're making those choices. We're giving them plenty of optionality. We\u2019re also focused on highlighting a couple other value options on our menu, made those more prominent, so I think right now, I feel really good where we're at. I think the dynamics will change a little bit in the back half of the year as our promotional calendar changes, and we'll have some more full-price promotions, and the trade will be a little bit different. So, I feel really good right now about it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.","Brian Bittner","Thanks. Good morning, Gene and Rick. Question on the same-store sales guidance for the rest of the year. It implies that over the next two quarters, your business will trend as good or maybe even better than it just did in the second quarter, and this is really happening at a time when many expect the environment to soften in the next year, so what's driving your confidence in this forecast from the angle that you have?","Rick Cardenas","Yeah, Brian. Our forecast for the year of approximately 2.5% is driven by a few things. One is our confidence in what we've been doing for the last four years in improving our execution in the restaurants. If you look at our year-to-date, same-restaurant sales, it would basically assume it's a slightly lower number than what we are today, and if you look at a few other minor things, we've got weather. Last year's weather was a typical-year weather, and we expect it to not be dramatically worse than last year, so that should help versus what we've seen in the past.","And, we've got just slight -- just slight improvements because of holiday shifts, not major, but those are the slight differences with where we were before. We feel really good about our same-restaurant sales estimates for the rest of the year, and we're looking forward to hitting them.","Brian Bittner","Thanks, Rick. Last question is on Cheddar's. Gene, can you just talk about any progress you expect to see there moving forward? I know during the quarter for the first time, you got all the store-level management positions filled across the portfolio, which I would assume is a pretty big deal. Is this starting to drive any type of tangible improvement in the operations that you can speak to?","Gene Lee","You know we're seeing -- as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're seeing for the first time a leading indicator that we're heading in the right direction, which is guest satisfaction. These scores are improving significantly each month, and we can point to things that we've done. We're seeing significant improvement on Friday and Saturday night now that we have managers positioned in the right place. Our throughput is up significantly. We're closing the gap on same-restaurant sales on those nights.","So, we can see operationally some results. Now, they're just not manifesting themselves into the overall same-restaurant sales number. I will say that we've had a couple discrete issues in a couple restaurants that have really hurt the trend in the last couple weeks of the quarter. Those things will work themselves out. But, I am extremely optimistic right now with what I'm seeing. I think operationally, we had to make this reorg. We held off, but we had to unify these operating cultures, and our teams are really focused on the right things, and for the first time, we've got 98% of the restaurants have a managing partner or general manager in there. We're getting close to fully staffed. We're stopping the churn. We still have the 10 restaurants that we acquired in Georgia that are still down double digits. We expect that to lessen as we moved through the years. We've stabilized those restaurants with leadership.","So, overall, I think that we're moving in the right direction, and I'm excited that J.W. and his team -- J.W. has only been in there just over three months, so he's still just getting out there, and listening to people, and trying to really hone in on the operational plan, but I think we're moving directionally in the right direction. I'm seeing something for the first time that gives me confidence with these guest satisfaction scores. The next big thing is can we see some improvement in the human resource metrics?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens, Inc. You may go ahead.","Will Slabaugh ","Yeah, thanks, guys. You mentioned this is the last quarter for the incremental workforce investment. Could you talk about what that headwind has been, if that's been different quarter to quarter, and maybe what we should expect a headwind would look like going forward?","Rick Cardenas ","Yeah, Will. The overall incremental investments are about $9 million a quarter in the first quarter and in the second quarter. And if you recall, we started that last year in Q3, so we shouldn't have incremental investments in the back half of the year. So, the run rate investments are about $35 million, and if you recall, we did about $20 million last year, so we should be wrapping on that with no problem.","Will Slabaugh ","Okay, I appreciate that. And, just following back up on the Cheddar's comment, it sounds like you're pretty pleased with what's happening behind the scenes, and obviously, you want that to come through on the top line eventually, but I'm curious if you think at some point that may require additional investment of some sort. It sounds like much of that has been made, but just curious as we think about these investments going away if there might be needing to replace that or not.","Rick Cardenas ","No, I don't think there's anything additional from a big investment standpoint. We do think that some of the very large brands that are promoting real heavily right now and advertising is having a little impact on Cheddar's top line. So, we're trying to figure out maybe how we might market the business maybe a little bit differently to increase our share of voice where everybody else is out there pretty loud right now, but we don't see anything major. One of the things that's also exciting I didn't mention is cost managements improving dramatically with our tools in place. We're seeing food waste come down, we're just getting a labor management system up and running, so we think that we're going to see some cost benefits as we move forward in the next 12 months. The teams are really doing a good job in getting accustomed to our tools, so...another thing that we're excited about.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.","David Palmer ","Hi. Quick follow-up on the price promotions over at Olive Garden. You mentioned that heading into the back half, you have some full-price promotions coming up and you feel good about those. Are you generally implying that you\u2019re going to have a little bit more comparable promoted price points and perhaps a little bit different and more even balance between traffic and check in the coming months?","Gene Lee","I don't know if I, my point that I was trying to make there was the big change we made with our chicken alfredo dish and the positive mix change that had in Q2 was primarily because we had lower-priced promotions. As the promotional calendar goes up and the price point goes up in the third and fourth quarter, you\u2019ll have less trade, the trade will be less beneficial. And so, that was the point that I was trying to make. I feel good about our promotional calendar in the back half of the year.","We\u2019re usually not, we\u2019re usually starting at price point to headline our promotions versus the deep value promotions. I think lastly on that question, David, as we try to develop our incentive strategy in the back half of the year, these levers are pretty easy for us to pull and we can do it pretty quickly, but if demand stays strong in the industry and we can achieve our same-restaurant sales targets. We will still not be using this lever a whole lot in the back half of the year.","David Palmer","Got it. And just a quick question on delivery you can see everybody\u2019s grabbing a digital delivery partner these days. You still have double-digit off-premise growth at Olive Garden, but how is your thinking shifting with regard to delivery for those not catering delivery, but ultimately, individual delivery for Olive Garden? Thanks.","Gene Lee","David, I have really no update on third-party. We continue to test a small group of restaurants and monitor the results. All I\u2019ll say is the economics of this have to change along with the execution. The execution of a third party has to improve dramatically. The satisfaction of the guest is not great using these services and we\u2019re focused on creating a great off-premise experience for our consumer. We\u2019ll encourage them to come pick it up. We\u2019re still growing at a good rate. I really like what\u2019s happened in that business. The satisfaction of our consumer using that experience is really high. And so at this point, we have no additional update really on third-party.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. You may go ahead.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. Gene, one the industry, the competitive landscape, I\u2019m surprised to hear you say that despite the broader industry being better that you think you\u2019re seeing maybe a ramp up in discounting of the competition. Just wondering if your expectation over the next couple of quarters maybe is that you would start to expect the industry to pull back on the incentive similar to what you did, and perhaps where you see the industry comp over the next six months relative to what seems to your forecast to be in the 2.5% range. And then, I had one follow-up.","Gene Lee","Yeah. I mean, as we look at what the industry\u2019s doing, we see increased advertising spending significant increase in advertising spending. The products that they\u2019re promoting are pretty aggressive in price and therefore, you\u2019re seeing check average for the industry get below 2%. We haven't seen that in a long time for any extended period of time. And so, we'll continue to monitor -- this is putting tremendous pressure on their margins, and we'll see how long they're willing to eat into their margin growth to have this kind of intensity out there.","We think we're nimble enough that we can adjust to what's happening, and it'll be interesting for us to see what they do. We feel we have levers that we can pull, and we can compete effectively against them. Right now, we think the consumer is in a really good place. We're operating at our lowest unemployment in 50 years; confidence remains high. As we watch the guests, they're continuing to buy across our menus. They're adding on to their entrees, they're buying up -- it feels like it's a really good environment, so we think it's prudent to have the strategy that we have right now.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Understood. And then, in terms of future potential tailwinds, there's a lot of talk about expectations in terms of tax refunds over the next few months, which I guess could be a significant tailwind for some, maybe not for others. I'm just wondering -- with your diverse brands across the consumer income spectrum, what are your thoughts in terms of how tax refunds will have an impact? Separately, I think fiscal '20 for you has a 53rd week. I was wondering if you would offer any directional color on the potential EPS impact. Thank you.","Gene Lee","I'll let Rick answer the 53rd week. That's too complex for a CEO. So, what was the first...?","Jeffrey Bernstein","The tax refund potential impact across your brands.","Gene Lee","So, tailwinds -- Jeff, we do know that there's going to be -- we've heard any number -- $60 billion out there in the first quarter of tax refunds. We'll see how that plays out. Obviously, that's a positive. I think that...we don't have the same tailwinds that we had going into our fiscal '19 -- the first half. In the second half -- we got some on the first half -- I just think overall, the biggest tailwind of all is sub-4% unemployment, which is a real positive. As long as the consumer feels confident that they're going to keep their job and that wages are going to grow, I think that the restaurant environment should be pretty positive.","Rick Cardenas","Yeah, and as it relates to the 53rd week, that is our last fiscal week of next year, and it's roughly about a 2% increase in EPS. It's one week out of 52, and that's really how it flows.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim. You may go ahead.","Matt DiFrisco","Thank you. I just have a follow-up question on some of the margin questions here. I know you had on the slide here on your presentation the labor, and you broke that down -- that's very helpful. Just curious, Rick -- on the 1.2% inflation for Q2, what's embedded in your outlook for the remainder of the year?","Rick Cardenas","For the remainder of the year, we still expect total labor to be about 4.5%-5.5% for the year, so if you just get the midpoint of that about 4% -- which is what we've been running, so, as we said, a little over 3.5% for the last quarter, so we don't expect it to dramatically change, and we haven't changed our outlook for overall inflation. Our overall total inflation outlook is still 2%, which includes labor and commodities.","Matt DiFrisco","Okay. So, when you look at the labor line when you have the 1.2%, you're netting that number, then. So, the 4% -- you're just netting that versus the comp, basically?","Rick Cardenas","No, the 1.2% is the labor percent impact of inflation.","Matt DiFrisco","Got it.","Rick Cardenas","So, that was the impact, and again, with a little over 3.5% labor inflation, that shows up to 1.2% labor percent.","Matt DiFrisco ","Understood. And then, just looking at the productivity in Other, assuming that those are related more so to ongoing things and momentum behind the business, or were those somewhat related to specific to this current period with less incentives and less discounting, or are those new processes in place that you think continue throughout the year?","Rick Cardenas ","No, those are things that we've been working on for the last few years. All of the productivity enhancements -- as you remember, we've done a lot of work at Olive Garden, we've been simplifying the menu at LongHorn, we're starting to do some work at Cheddar's. We would expect that our productivity would continue to improve. Whether it's 40 basis points going forward, or 20, or 60, I can't answer that question, but we do expect to continue productivity improvements going forward.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. You may go ahead.","Sara Senatore ","Thanks. I have a question on Olive Garden comps, and then a quick follow-up on the other segments. On Olive Garden, obviously, you seem very confident in the comp drivers through the year, but I wonder if you could put it into context in the last few years in the sense that you noted 17 quarters of positive comp, which roughly corresponds to when you took the helm and refocused on value. So, is there any risk that there was a lot of low-hanging fruit on that front, and then, perhaps it just gets more difficult from here, or just about basic blocking and tackling in the sense of improvement in customer scores or satisfaction is somewhat asymptotic and you've kind of leveled out? Just trying to get a sense of how you think about this run of very strong comps in historical context. And then, again, I have a follow-up question.","Gene Lee ","Good morning, Sara. You brought up a lot of good points there. We have done a lot over the last four years with Olive Garden to reestablish the brand as the value leader. However, this still -- I still believe today there's a lot of opportunity for us to improve across our fleet of restaurants. We think that scale gives us a competitive advantage in Olive Garden. We're able to continue to find productivity enhancements. We think there are future investments that we can continue to make to increase value.","I think the big difference between where we are today in this cycle versus where we were seven or eight years ago when Olive Garden was into a good growth cycle is that we're making investments back into the business. When I studied the history last time, Olive Garden started to drift maybe a little upscale and really didn't focus on what gave them the great advantage. I think the decision the management team made to increase the chicken alfredo portion by 50% in protein is an example of what we'll continue to do to be able to increase value and drive guest counts and sales into the future.","We think we have some other opportunities. We're being innovative from a marketing standpoint. I think our marketing is as relevant today as it has been in a long time. And, more importantly, I think the younger consumer -- the millennials -- they really enjoy Olive Garden. They enjoy the value in it. They enjoy the communal piece of it, of coming together and enjoying a meal, so I think it's really well positioned, and we're going to continue to double down on simplification and value. And so, we think that we\u2019re well positioned to continue to compete effectively into the future.","Sara Senatore","That\u2019s very helpful, thank you. And then, just on the other business segment, I notice that Yard House is obviously small. It had a negative comp in the quarter, which we hadn\u2019t seen in a while. I was just trying to understand if there\u2019s something about varied menu that\u2019s particularly competitive, or is there any risk that maybe Cheddar\u2019s is taking managerial attention or resources away from the other brands. Just trying to understand if there\u2019s anything to read into that.","Gene Lee","Yeah. Let me be very clear about this. Cheddar\u2019s is not taking any managerial focus away from any of the other brands. I mean these other brands have full presence, full management teams that have nothing to do with Cheddar\u2019s. I would just say on Yard House, we had a positive two year comp. We had a couple high-volume restaurants that had some pressure. For those who are familiar, the Link in L.A. had scaffolding all around our building as they were building a zipline in from some place to drop people off in front of our restaurants, which had an impact. California was a little soft. We had some restaurants in Florida that were a little soft toward the end of the quarter.","I\u2019m focused on total growth on Yard House, and we\u2019re opening a lot of restaurants, which also creates some churn inside the system. Overall, Yard House is an extremely strong brand and I do think that from time to time, we\u2019ll fluctuate, especially with some of these high-volume restaurants. They can swing the comp a little bit. But, I feel really good about where Yard House is positioned. We\u2019re opening some great restaurants and I\u2019m really excited about their future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. You may go ahead.","Peter Saleh","Great, thanks. Gene, I just wanted to come back to the Cheddar\u2019s commentary. Is this the first quarter that you\u2019re seeing the guest satisfaction scores improve at Cheddar\u2019s and is this the highest they\u2019ve been since you guys acquired the brand?","Gene Lee","They\u2019ve been improving for the last six months, but right now they are at the highest they\u2019ve been since we acquired them. Our value ratings are still extremely strong in this business. And so, we feel really good about where we are. We know hour-to-hour today, we\u2019re running these restaurants better than we were six to nine months ago, and we can see it in the results.","Peter Saleh","And then historically, when you look at your other brands, what has been the lag between seeing the improving guest satisfaction scores and then starting to see the top line starting to trend better as well?","Gene Lee","Well, I\u2019m not so sure that there\u2019s a perfect correlation in any of that because there\u2019s marketing; there\u2019s other things in the environment. All I know is that in all my years of experience, once we get the leading indicators going in the right direction, sales will follow.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.","John Glass","Hi. Thanks very much. First, just on the off-premise business, it\u2019s been growing strongly for a number of quarters. It didn\u2019t grow quite at the same rate quarter. Is that just a function of the base effect, it\u2019s just a bigger business, so compounding is harder? Did some of the changing in promotional activities maybe impact that business as well as the dine-in business? Can you just talk about your current views on the incrementality of that business? Is that still a very strong different customer, different occasion, or how do you measure incrementality of the off-premise business?","Gene Lee","Yeah. Hi, John. I think the answer to your questions are yes and yes. I think as this gets bigger, it\u2019s going to be harder to continue to grow it at a compounded growth rate. I\u2019m thrilled with 10%. This is a big business now. Yes, we did pull back on some incentives that had some impact on off-premise. This time of year, off-premise gets to be pretty strong, so we definitely want to make sure that we're taking advantage and that we're getting full price. The incrementality of this business is always hard to really measure. We do know by looking at the demographics of the people that are using us that a lot of these off-premise customers are only off-premise customers, and they don't really dine inside an Olive Garden all that much. They're probably using a chef-driven restaurant or a higher-end restaurant. So, we believe all that\u2019s incremental.","But, the bottom line the way I think about it is you're in the top of mind for that occasion, and you need to win the occasion -- as many occasions that you possibly can, and whether that impacts you into the future -- I don't know, I just think those are two totally different occasions, and what we work hard at is being top of mind in each of them, and we'll never know for sure what's incremental and what's not. We just know we want to play, we want to be very good, the best at off-premise, and try to create a frictionless experience. We want to be the very best of in-restaurant that we can possibly be, and that's what we're working hard at.","John Glass","Thank you. And then, just to follow up, what is the current state of the estate for the two major brands? We've seen a lot of capital go into the limited-service restaurant industry. I think some of our competitors are continuing to upgrade their assets. How do you feel relative to the competitive set and relative to your own expectations about the estate, both at Olive Garden and LongHorn, and remodel possibilities if there is one over time?","Gene Lee","We feel pretty good. We've been working hard at the Olive Garden. We've done approximately 230 remodels to date in the last four years; we did 28 in the quarter. We've got a few more to do -- we've got another 70 to do to get that fleet up to speed. Then, we're going to start just freshening the Farm Houses, which will not take nowhere near the capital that the RevItalia restaurants needed, so we feel like that fleet's in really good shape. We think LongHorn has got a little bit more of a timeless d\u00e9cor. The capital that we're putting into LongHorn right now is really to upgrade the off-premise experience, so we're putting a little bit of capital in there to create a space for the consumer to be able to make the experience a little less frictionless than it has been in the past. So, we feel good. We think our buildings have stood the test of time.","The other thing I would add -- and, this is pre-this management team, and we've been able to continue it on -- is Darden has always done a great job with its maintenance capital and keeping its restaurants looking fabulous. There's times I walk into an Olive Garden that's 25 years old that really hasn't been remodeled recently, and I'll look around and say, \"Boy, this place looks great. We've got good furniture, we're well painted, it looks clean.\" And so, our team has done a great job keeping these buildings in outstanding condition.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Greg Francfort with Bank of America. You may go ahead.","Greg Francfort","Hey. I had two margin questions. The first one is for Rick. I think in the first quarter, you had said wage inflation was 5%, and this quarter, it was just over 3.5%. Are those comparable numbers, and what are you seeing in terms of that step-down in terms of your wage pressure?","Rick Cardenas","What we said in the first quarter, I believe, is that hourly wage inflation was about 5%, but total inflation was closer to 3.5%, so these are comparable -- a little over 3.5% is very comparable to what we've been seeing before.","Greg Francfort ","Understood, thanks. And then, Gene, one thing we've seen that I think has been a multi-year story for Olive Garden and Darden has been marketing dropping as a percent of sales. I guess, what's the strategy there, and what level are you looking to see or trying to get to in terms of marketing, and where are you cutting back, and where are you reinvesting?","Gene Lee ","You broke up a little bit. I hate to ask -- can you repeat the question?","Greg Francfort ","No worries. Marketing as a percent of sales has been dropping for a few years. What's the overall strategy, what's the long-term goal, where are you trimming back, where are you reinvesting on that front, and where do you see that going over the long term?","Gene Lee ","Yeah. First of all, it's been dropping at the Darden level because of brand mix. As the smaller brands start to grow with a little less marketing spend, it's levering that down a little bit. We've worked hard over the last four years to decrease our non-working media. That was an area I thought that was a big opportunity inside Darden, so we've been able to eliminate some of those costs, and some of those non-working costs we transferred to working, and some of them we've been able to just put back into the P&L. We're going to continue with our big brands really honing in our advertising, improving our messaging, getting our messaging in the right place at the right time. And so, we think that our current spending levels are appropriate to support these businesses. I think that's why new unit growth in Olive Garden is so important, because we get to leverage the advertising spend. In some situations, it's the same for Olive Garden, and we'll continue to find ways to appropriately spend for our smaller brands.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. You may go ahead.","Chris O'Cull ","Thanks, good morning. Rick, the earnings guidance seems to imply the growth in restaurant-level costs per operating week would be at a greater rate in the back half of the year than what you saw in the last quarter. I understand commodity costs may be higher, but why would labor costs and restaurant expenses per operating week start to grow at a faster rate?","Rick Cardenas ","Well, this quarter, the restaurant expenses actually were flat, so they didn't grow at all. So we would expect normal inflation to happen in the restaurant expense line. As we've said, we've had very minimal inflation on the food and beverage line, and we expect our inflation to tick up in the back half of the year. We're also making investments. Gene mentioned the investment that Olive Garden made in the chicken alfredo. And finally, we've got a little bit of timing in the marketing line. We would expect our marketing as a percent to lever year-over-year, but it might be a little bit higher than it was in the last quarter.","Chris O'Cull ","Okay, that's helpful. Gene, were the leadership Cheddar's recruited from within Darden or outside the company? And maybe can you discuss if you've made any changes to the operators' bonus metrics or how they're incentivized?","Gene Lee ","Everybody that's on the Cheddar's management team in senior levels are long-term Darden employees who understand our systems, understand our thought process, understand our branding. And, as far as bonus, Cheddar's this year is on the bonus program that all our other restaurant brands are on for the first time, which heavily incentivizes sales growth and profit growth.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. You may go ahead.","Andrew Strelzik ","Hey, good morning. Two questions for me. Last quarter, you mentioned an improvement in the retention rates at Cheddar\u2019s and it sounds like maybe they took a step back this quarter. And I\u2019m just wondering what are some of the challenges that you\u2019re finding with respect to the HR metrics and retention specifically at Cheddar\u2019s. And number two, we all know about the cost environment in the restaurant space and you mentioned about the importance of advertising budgets with respect to driving sales. So, I\u2019m just wondering if you could comment a little bit more about maybe what you\u2019re seeing in the independent restaurants. Are you seeing accelerated closures given the cost side or any change in behaviors there? That would be a helpful color.","Gene Lee ","Okay. On Cheddar\u2019s retention, it hasn\u2019t gone backwards; it hasn\u2019t made the improvement I was hoping for. I think what we\u2019re struggling with both at the team member and management level here is expectations, right. We\u2019ve come in, we\u2019re starting to put in some structure and some processes, the expectations are a little higher. And so, when you go through this kind of turnaround, you do end up losing some management along the way. A lot of some, of the management that was in the system was tethered to the old management. They had worked with them before and when you make those changes those folks leave.","So, I\u2019m confident that we will start seeing the Cheddar\u2019s human resource metrics start to come toward the Darden norms. And when we see that, I think our operations will improve. It took us a couple years to make those improvements happen in Yard House. And I expect that we\u2019ll make progress here over the next 12 months. Its basic things and I know I keep coming back to this but we didn\u2019t have an effective way to train new employees. We don\u2019t have a great certified trainer program that we have in all of our other businesses. Now, we\u2019re developing that and we\u2019re implementing that. We have to ensure that everybody that we hire goes through a great training program.","On the independent restaurant scene we know. Again, the CREST data has been saying for years that large brands are taking share from smaller brands and independent restaurants. We\u2019ve seen some closures out there for independent restaurants but as I said before most of the time once a restaurant is a restaurant, it stays a restaurant, it just flips its name and goes down for two or three months, and then someone else comes in and tries to make it work. So, again we\u2019re in an up cycle which is when a lot of people think they want to be in the restaurant business. So, independents are there. I think it\u2019s tough for them to compete in this environment.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brandon Sonnemaker with J.P. Morgan. You may go ahead.","Brandon Sonnemaker ","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just to clarify, labor costs in the quarter, it came in better than expected relative to our model. Obviously, you experienced 50 bps of labor deleverage this quarter. Once the 30 bps of workforce investment rolls off, you mentioned the productivity savings will continue to improve. Just to be clear, is it your expectation that the amount of labor deleverage moderates in the back half?","Rick Cardenas ","Yes, just a little bit.","Brandon Sonnemaker ","Okay, great. And then, you mentioned two promotions during the quarter, Buy One, Take One and Never Ending Pasta. I believe these were also run during the same period last year. Would you mind sharing if these were run for less weeks relative to last year. And could you also clarify your expectation for the back half of the year? Will you have more or less promotions relative to last year?","Gene Lee ","Yeah. You broke up again for some reason. Could you repeat that question?","Brandon Sonnemaker ","Yeah. Just Buy One, Take One and Never Ending Pasta Bowl during the quarter -- I believe those were run during the same period last year. Would you mind sharing if those were run for less weeks relative to last year? And then, your expectation for the back half, whether promotions will be up or down relative to last year.","Gene Lee","Buy One, Take One and Never Ending Pasta Bowl were the exact same as last year, and we expect our promotional calendar to mirror pretty much what we did last year in the back half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. You may go ahead.","Nicole Miller","Good morning. I wanted to understand a little bit more about the relatively higher-end concept, so could you talk about Cap Grille, Eddie V's, and the performance there? Is that driven mostly by check or traffic? And then, the second part of the question -- is it coming from the main dining room, or is there something in private dining that would account for those trends? And then, anything you'd be willing to share on the holiday progression so far? Thank you.","Gene Lee","Yeah. We had another strong quarter in our upscale businesses. Capital Grille had a great quarter, continues to focus on driving guest counts. I would say there's guest counts and check in those numbers. Capital Grille is adding a little bit of capacity in a few restaurants, which has been helpful. We've got a lot of restaurants at full capacity, so we're managing full capacity and price, but the business is performing well. We're making meaningful progress in Eddie V's. We're real excited about the progress we've made there, especially on the income statement. That P&L is starting to look more like a Capital Grille P&L over time as the cost structure comes into line, so we think there's tremendous upside there. We've got a pretty good pipeline for Eddie V's, and we've got some good pipeline for Capital Grille in the future, which we'll discuss in an upcoming call, so we're excited about that.","I'm not going to talk about private dining in December. Just know those businesses are healthy; they're running good. Let me sneak in a comment here about Seasons also because we're making great progress in Seasons. Although same-restaurant sales were down for the quarter, guest counts were positive. We've been making the strategic choice to bring check average down a little bit. And, I'm also thrilled with -- John Martin's overseeing that business right now, and he's taken a lot of costs out of the business that needed to be taken out, and year-over-year profitability is up. So, I'm excited about the direction of Seasons 52. We've got a good pipeline there, and I think that business is well positioned to really start to make a meaningful growth push into the future.","Nicole Miller","And, just a quick follow-up -- when you talk about capacity, do you make additions at the bar, the main dining room, or private dining?","Gene Lee","We've closed a few patios, which have given us an extra 25 seats in restaurants, so that gives us full utilization of that space year-round.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Stephen Anderson with Maxim Group. You may go ahead.","Stephen Anderson","Yes. This is a follow-up to Nicole's question on Capital Grille. Have you seen any kind of -- with the recent volatility in the financial markets, have you seen any declines in the business in some of the walk-in business for Cap Grille, and maybe to a lesser extent, at Eddie V's? Just wanted to see your thoughts about that.","Gene Lee","No, Stephen. We haven't seen any of that. Again, 3.7% Cap Grille for the quarter -- it's been strong, and we've got some restaurants in New York City, and it's been strong, so we haven't seen anything correlated to what's going on in the markets.","Operator","Thank you. And, there are no further questions. I'll now turn it back to Kevin Kalicak for any closing remarks.","Kevin Kalicak","Thanks again, Sue. That concludes our call, and I'd like to remind everyone that we plan to release third-quarter results on Thursday, March 21st before the market opens, with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today's call.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. All participants may disconnect."],"7302":["Darden Restaurants, Inc.

Your lines have been placed on a listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.","Kevin Kalicak","Thank you, Jill. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's CEO and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings on September 19th before the market opens, followed by a conference call.","This morning, Gene will discuss our fiscal year performance and quarterly business highlights and Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from both the fourth quarter and the full year before providing our initial outlook for fiscal 2020. As a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated Knapp Track excluding Darden. During our fiscal fourth quarter, industry total sales growth was 0.7%, industry same-restaurant sales declined 0.3% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 2.4%. For the full fiscal year industry total sales growth was 1.6%, industry same-restaurant sales grew 0.7%, and industry same-restaurant guest count decreased 1.2%.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thank you Kevin and good morning everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning the fourth quarter wrapped up a very strong fiscal 2019 for Darden. Total sales from continuing operations for the year were $8.5 billion, an increase of 5.3%, same-restaurant sales for the year increased 2.5%, and adjusted net earnings per share were $5.82, an increase of 21% from last year. ","I want to start this morning by briefly talking about the industry dynamics we saw during the fourth quarter and also share some thoughts on the consumer. As you know the industry experienced sales volatility during the quarter. After a good March, April was a challenging month but the industry bounced back in May. A significant part of the volatility was due to the holiday shift which helped March but hurt April. Our business follow the same pattern and I was pleased to see that our traffic gap to the industry expanded each month throughout the quarter. As we think about the consumer and look at the macro environment the economy continues to be strong, unemployment is at the lowest levels in nearly 50 years, wages are growing at a healthy rate outpacing inflation, and the consumer confidence remains high.","Turning to our brand highlights for the quarter, Olive Garden had a good quarter which resulted in its 19th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales of 3.7% driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 2.4% and 1.3% growth from new restaurants. Same-restaurant guest counts declined 0.4% but Olive Garden's gap to the industry expanded throughout the quarter even as they continued to reduce incentives. If you adjust for lack of incentives guest counts would have been positive during the quarter. ","Check average increased by 2.8% this quarter comprised of 1.6% pricing and 1.2% menu mix. The reduction in menu mix compared to prior quarters was driven primarily by promotional offerings being similar to the prior year. Olive Garden's results were driven by the teams focus on flawless execution, everyday value, and their off premise business. During the quarter the restaurant team focused on flawless execution to help maintain all time high guest satisfaction ratings. A great example of this focus was on Mother's Day the busiest day of the year at Olive Garden when they recorded the highest Mother's Day sales ever.","Olive Garden continued to strengthen its everyday value platform throughout the quarter. They refreshed their $5 value drink platform and increased awareness on everyday value through secondary T.V. advertising which highlighted their lunch duos starting at $6.99, every day early dinner duo starting at $8.99 and Cucina Mia starting at $9.99. Finally Olive Garden's off premise sales increased 9% representing 15% of total sales. The team remained focused on improving to go capabilities and executing at a high level while driving continued growth in our catering business.","Olive Garden had an excellent year. They continued to gain share in casual dining market share as they grew total sales 5% to $4.3 billion which outperformed the industry benchmark by 340 basis points, and grew traffic for the fourth year in a row. The business remains strong and the team is doing a great job of executing against this strategy to drive frequency among their most loyal guests while making the appropriate investments.","LongHorn Steakhouse had another strong quarter. Total sales grew 5.7% driven by 2.4% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 3.3%, the 25th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. Same-restaurant guest counts grew 0.3%. The LongHorn team continued to successfully execute their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive executions, and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagements. They remain focused on creating relevant promotions by leveraging their guests favorite core menu items. Focusing on core items ensures their operators are able to execute at a very high level. LongHorn team also continued do a great job of supporting these promotions by telling a quality story with multiple guest touch points.","Additionally during the quarter LongHorn launched a new beverage program that brought their focus on quality, simplicity, and culture to life. The program is focused on strengthening their growing beverage sales, initial guest feedback has been positive. Finally the LongHorn team has been focused on ensuring that to go experience equals their in restaurants experience for guests who choose this convenience. They're enhancing their capabilities and have a dedicated to go area in 40% of their restaurants. This ongoing focus has resulted in improvements and overall experience with high guest satisfaction scores for order accuracy and timeliness. ","I'm very pleased with LongHorn performance this year. They continue to take share of the casual dining market as they grew total sales 6.3% to $1.8 billion which outperformed the industry benchmark by 470 basis points. These results reflect their commitment to execute their long-term strategies.","Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen total sales increased 0.6% in the fourth quarter driven by sales growth from new restaurants of 3.8% and offset by same-restaurant sales decline of 3.2%. The magnitude of this decline was driven by the formerly former franchise restaurants which fell 6.1%. The original company restaurants were down 1.5%. I was encouraged to see a sequential improvement in guest count trends for Cheddar's from Q3 to Q4.","At the beginning of the fiscal year the Cheddar's team established three strategic priorities, faster wins, master the tools, and standardizing and simplify with the goal of repairing fundamental elements of the business and shifting momentum. During the quarter they continued to make progress against these priorities. Overall staffing levels for both team member and managers are now on par with our standards, this better enables the Cheddar's team to focus on execution and while turnover has improved it is still significantly above the Darden norm.","In addition the restaurant teams continue to build actively with our systems and tools. They improved the use of their guest count forecasting application which is critical to run efficient shifts. Finally the Cheddar's team made progress with standardization and simplification by deploying new culinary processes during the quarter. These improvements contributed to better execution, efficiency, and productivity while enhancing speed of service. ","Fiscal 2019 was a challenging year for Cheddar's one that was filled with significant change. However, the team made meaningful progress throughout the year that helped Cheddar's deliver double-digit profit growth this quarter. And while I'm disappointed the work has yet to translate to top line sales growth I am encouraged that we saw 180 basis point improvement in guest count trends from the first half of the year to the second half of the year. These improvements indicate momentum is beginning to shift in the right direction. There's still a lot of work left to be done but I'm confident in the plan that Cheddar's team has in place and their ability to execute it. ","Fiscal 2019 was a great year for Darden. Our restaurant teams demonstrated their commitment to getting better every day as they executed our back to basics operating philosophies and we continued to make meaningful progress in strengthening our core competitive advantages. I remain convinced that we have the right strategy in place and we are well positioned to achieve our long-term value creation framework over time. On behalf of our Board of Directors and Senior Leadership Team I want to thank our 185,000 team members for all they do to make our company successful. Now I'll turn it over to Rick. ","Rick Cardenas","Thank you Gene and good morning everyone. We're pleased with our fourth quarter performance. We grew total sales by 4.5% from the addition of 39 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 1.6%. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was a $1.76, an increase of 26.6% from last year. This quarter we paid $92 million in dividends and repurchased $42 million in shares returning a total of $134 million of capital to our shareholders.","Looking at the P&L restaurant level EBITDA margin was flat versus last year and adjusted EBIT margins expanded 10 basis points to 11% this quarter. Food and beverage was flat to last year as pricing and cost savings offset inflation of just over 1% and unfavorable menu mix. Restaurant labor of 32.2% was unfavorable 10 basis points driven by mark-to-market while the 120 basis points of unfavorability from continued wage inflation was offset by favorability from pricing leverage, incremental sales leverage from higher check mix, and productivity improvements.","Both marketing and G&A were favorable 10 basis points driven by sales leverage. Depreciation and amortization was unfavorable 20 basis points as we continued to invest in new restaurant growth, remodels, and technology. Impairments were favorable 20 basis points as we lapped $4.5 million of impairments last year for restaurants that were earmarked for closing as their leases expired.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 5.5%. This rate was approximately 400 basis points lower than we anticipated in March. Roughly half of this favorability was from a higher than anticipated benefit from stock option exercise and mark-to-market hedges. The remainder was the result of strategic tax projects that were completed in Q4.","Turning to our segment performance, all of our segments grew total sales and segment profit dollars again this quarter. Segment profit margin held flat at both Olive Garden and LongHorn while the fine dining and other segments grew segment profit margins. Of particular note in the other segments as Gene mentioned Cheddar's significantly grew segment profit this quarter even with negative same-restaurant sales as they focused on running more efficient food costs and labor.","Fiscal 2019 was another great year of performance as our brands continued to leverage Darden's scale and other competitive advantages. Our strong operating models generates significant cash flows and this year was no exception. This year's strong top and bottom line performance drove approximately $1.2 billion in EBITDA from continuing operations. We invested approximately $450 million of capital in the business and returned over a $0.5 billion to shareholders consisting of $371 million in dividends and $208 million in share repurchases. In fact since 2016 we've grown EBITDA 9% annually and returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders each year in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Before I share our outlook for fiscal 2020 I want to reiterate our long-term value creation framework. This framework calls for a 10% to 15% total shareholder return which is meant to be achieved over time assuming a constant earnings multiple. Our total shareholder -- our actual total shareholder returns have well exceeded our long-term framework since its introduction in 2015. In fact our annualized TSR over the three year fiscal period ended May 26th was approximately 25%.","To achieve our long-term framework we anticipate earnings after tax growth of 7% to 10% which is made up of total sales growth of between 3% to 6% and EBIT margin expansions between 10 to 30 basis points. Additionally we expect to return another 3% to 5% to shareholders in the form of a dividend payout ratio of between 50% and 60% of our net income and share repurchases between $150 million and $250 million.","As I mentioned on last quarter's call fiscal 2020 includes two unique items. First, it's a 53 week year and we anticipate a positive impact on diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of roughly $0.15. Second, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we are implementing ASC 842, the new accounting standard for leases. We currently estimate this will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.05. Roughly three quarters of this impact is in interest while the rest impacts EBIT. ","Now turning to our full outlook for fiscal 2020 we expect total sales growth of 5.3% to 6.3% driven by approximately 2% from the addition of the 53rd week, same-restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and approximately 44 net new restaurants. Capital spending between $450 million and $500 million, total inflation of approximately 2.5% with commodities inflation of 1% to 2% and total labor inflation of 3.5% [Technical Difficulty] to 4.5%. An annual effective tax rate of 10% to 11% and approximately 124 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $6.30 and $6.45.","This morning we also announced that our Board approved a 17% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $0.88 per share implying an annual dividend of $3.52 resulting in a yield of 3% based on yesterday's closing share price. And with that we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will be from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company. Sir, your line is open.","Michael Tamas","Great, thanks. This is actually Mike Tamas on for Brian. You guys started talking about a pretty healthy consumer environment so when you think about driving sales in 2020 is the playbook the same, is there anything you think you need to do differently whether you're looking at a competitive environment and how you think about 2020 sales drivers versus say the last 12 months which is really healthy? Thanks. ","Gene Lee","I think we stay focused on our back to basics philosophy. I think it's getting more important than ever that we continue to ensure that our restaurants are staffed with the appropriate team members and that we're creating great dining experiences. We think there is still opportunity with throughput especially on the weekends in these high demand days and we are continuing to focus on how do we simplify our operations so that our teams can execute at a higher level. We're going to continue to win this at the 9 square feet. We've got to do a better job than our competitors do taking care of our guests and providing offerings that our guests are excited about. So I would sum that up by saying our playbook is not changing, we're focused on the exact same things.","Michael Tamas","Yeah, thanks. And just on the cost side of things, your total cost basket is up a little bit more in 2020 versus 2019. So is there anything that you have to do a little differently there, is there little more productivity you need to squeeze out of the model or how do you think about that? Thanks.","Rick Cardenas","Yeah, we are working on productivity every year. We don't anticipate squeezing out a lot more than we did last year. We still anticipate productivity enhancements but we also have a great supply chain team that will continue to look for cost savings to help offset any incremental inflation.","Michael Tamas","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Bittner. Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open sir.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. Gene just a question about the industry environment, I appreciate your opening remarks but if I look at the last three or four months it does look like traffic in the industry has softened relative to what we were running I guess the prior 12 months so wondering if you have some thoughts on why were you seeing that softening trend even when you kind of normalized out for the calendar shift? And then as you think about that trend do you think you need to sort of normalize the value promotion or maybe tick back up the value promotion master maybe pulling back on some of the offers over the last 12 months or 24 months? Thanks. ","Gene Lee","David, good morning. We've been trying to tease out the changes in traffic trend. I will pivot just here for one second to say we're really pleased about is this. The industry traffic has softened a little bit, our gap has increased. And that has been really reassuring. We haven't been able to point to any particular thing that's causing this traffic softness in the industry and we've tried kind of from different angles. Overall I think our thought is that consumers are still in a really good place and we don't see that changing here in the near-term. Obviously we're living in a more volatile environment. I will say one of the things that we do see is day to day, week to week there's a little bit more volatility than there was -- there had been. And again hard for us to try to figure out what's driving that. ","As far as value I think that we'll continue to look for ways to add value to the consumer proposition. I think as we think about incentives right now we believe that we're still in the mode of withdrawing incentives based on the environment. I'd rather continue to find ways to invest in what we call everyday value in the businesses but there's no doubt we've taken a lot of currency out of the marketplace and we do have that available to put back in if we think that's the right thing to do.","David Tarantino","And Gene maybe a follow-up on that last comment what would you need to see to add back some of those incentives or just more aggressive on the value side?","Gene Lee","Well, I think if our traffic started to go the other way against the industry and the gap started to shrink and I think then we have to consider what's going on with the business model. I think one of the things that we focus on is protecting our business model and using our scale not to make short-term decisions that may drive a few extra guests here and there but really aren't that profitable. So, I think as long as our gap to the industry is healthy from a traffic standpoint we will continue to be very cautious with that.","David Tarantino","Makes sense. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Tarantino. Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open sir. ","David Palmer","Thanks, good morning. Question on just the polished casual dining side, it does look like that's a little tougher than it has been in that segment. Wondering if there's a reason or insight there, tax season, stock markets might impact that segment more, also regionally bigger on the West Coast, and then separately on LongHorn is that brand picking up steam or was there in a way that feels like in the medium-term that it is widening its gap [to Knapp] [ph] or was there certain reasons within that quarter for that to happen? Thank you. ","Rick Cardenas","David great question on polished. I think I will sum that up as saying polished casual operates in some of the best retail trade areas across the country and I believe there's more good competition, smaller brands that are really good businesses that are expanding in those trade areas putting more pressure on our polished casual brands. And I'll use it, I think a very good example. I mean if you're going to grow True Foods where are you're going to put a True Foods today. You're going to put it right on top of the Seasons 52. And there are other brewery brands that are -- where are they going to put their businesses, they're going to put them right on top of the Yard House. And so those brands operate in very good trade areas and we are experiencing a little bit more competition there. So I think you asked a good question but I think that's the insight there. ","As far as LongHorn goes we've been making I think since -- when Todd Burrowes came back under his leadership we were making great investments in LongHorn. And I think that they have been multiple year investments and I think we're gaining a lot of momentum in that business. We have increased the size of the stakes, we have simplified the operation, we've simplified the promotional constructs and our retention is incredibly high and we're executing in a really high level. So I think there's a lot of good momentum in that business. ","And last thought on LongHorn is we had a pretty good growth curve there and really in the mid 2000 - between 2010 and 2015 we broke into a lot of new territories. And those new territories are really starting to mature nicely and we're getting good growth from them. Going in and being the fourth or fifth Steakhouse in a marketplace it's really tough to break in and get into the consumer routines. And over time we know that LongHorn will build loyalty in those years in their three to ten year cycle. So there's a lot of momentum in that piece of the business also.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Palmer. Our next question comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris O'Cull","Thanks, good morning guys. Gene several of the Bar and Grill and mid scale casual dining chains have been pretty aggressive with new promotional platforms and while Olive Garden clearly has a scale to compete is some of the other smaller brands like Cheddar's and Yard House, do they need to make any adjustments to their marketing strategy?","Gene Lee","Chris, I think they've got to always reexamine where they are from a value standpoint. I would say that Cheddar is just the value leader. Maybe there's some opportunity as we move forward to highlight that value differently and to bring that to life. There's no doubt and I've said that the last couple calls that the large casual dining brands are being much -- are much more effective and disciplined today and advertising very effectively and their share of voice is up. That's making it a little bit more difficult for Cheddar's to compete effectively. And we may have to think about how we go to market to highlight that great value that we have. But your insight is relevant and it's a challenge that we face with the Cheddar's brand. ","Chris O'Cull","Is there any plans to test or introduce anything in the coming quarters? ","Gene Lee","Yes, but I'm not going to talk about them. ","Chris O'Cull","Fair enough, thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. O'Cull. Our next question is from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open sir. ","Gregory Francfort","Hey, I just had two quick questions. The first one was just a follow up to David's question on polished casual is there a difference in terms of the store growth capacity as it's happening in polished casual versus maybe casual dining more broadly because my understanding was casual dining store growth might be slowing a little bit? And a question just for Rick, just on the cash balance and where it ended at the end of the quarter I think the last time you ran a cash balance, posted a tie you made a pretty big acquisition, is there a reason why maybe you're not deploying that cash for repurchases and as you think about acquisitions how much does Cheddar's perform and you need to turn that impact, your thoughts on future acquisitions? Thank you. ","Gene Lee","You know I'll go first on the polished growth. I think that it's an attractive space and we have a lot of entrepreneurs out there that over the last decade have created some pretty good concepts that are starting to get to -- getting past that 10 unit area and starting to grow. It's obviously an attractive marketplace but it's also relatively small. It just happens when we are a smaller polished brands, when we have increased competition it has a bigger effect on the overall top line number. What we do believe is that we can fight off that initial competition over 12 to 18 months and our restaurants will get back to the sales levels they were prior to the competition coming in. So it's just something that you have to -- I think you have to continue to operate really well and you don't make an adjustment in the short-term for that increased competition. You just go back to winning a 9 square feet and your business will get back to growth.","Rick Cardenas","As it relates to our cash balance even though we have significantly more cash than we had last year our teams are still focused on doing the things every day to continue to increase that cash balance. And one of the things that we did in the fourth quarter was we significantly improved our working capital position and we also did a few more sale leaseback. So that helped increase our cash balance and it talked to the team's ability to continue to find the best use of our cash and actually take as much cash in as we possibly can even though we have some cash. As it relates to what we're going to do with that we continue to speak to our Board to determine what the best use of that cash is, whether it's through share buybacks or dividends and as you have heard earlier we just increased our dividend by 17%. And we will find the right times to either buy back shares or acquisitions if they come to play. It has nothing to do with Cheddar's whether we're doing an acquisition right now or not, it just has to do with making sure that we have the right brand etcetera to target. ","Gregory Francfort","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Francfort. Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open sir.","John Glass","Thanks very much. I know Darden's position on delivery has been clear but Gene do you see either one, that delivery is helping the overall industry in any way, it may not show up in traffic but maybe it shows up in check for example? And two do you think by not participating in delivery at this point that it anyways puts you at a traffic or a total sales disadvantage? ","Gene Lee","I don't believe -- I'll start with the second part of that, I don't believe it has put us at a disadvantage at all. I really like the way our premise business continues to grow. I think we continue to remove [indiscernible] from the process and we continue to offer great value without having to have any destruction to our overall margins. And so I like where we are, I don't think we're missing out on anything. I think there is still -- this is still an immature business, there is still lots to learn. There's a lot of discussion around whether it's incremental, it's non-incremental. Where I want us to focus and I want our teams to focus on is creating a compelling in restaurant experience that people want to come and visit. I think when you do that that helps create the demand for the off premise visit. And we know convenience will continue to be important to the consumer but we're focused right now is to is to create a compelling off premise -- in restaurant experience that drives in a compelling off premise experience in which the consumer still wants to come and pick up -- will still come and pick up because the value and the quality of the offering is so strong.","John Glass","And just to follow-up, if I missed it I'm sorry, what was the Olive Garden off premise business this quarter and how much did it grow? And then just to the first part of my first question was simply do you see any evidence anyone is getting the real listed delivery or is this all talk and we haven't really seen the industry sales in fact benefit from this in total? ","Gene Lee","Yeah, so I missed that part John. I think that -- I don't think I have seen any real growth from it. I'm seeing margin destruction but that's just -- that's my opinion. We've got tests going on and we're not -- it's not -- the results aren't compelling enough that we're running out and doing something with it. I think with that I think it really indicates how we're feeling about it. Olive Garden's goal was 9% for the quarter, two years stack of almost 18%, it was 14.5% of sales. I'm just -- I'm really pleased with where we are with our off premise business. We continue to enhance those capabilities which is really important. And we continue to work with the adoption of digital and we think that's going to be a continued driver. And we've got some other investments that we're continuing to make and we will continue to make to remove some friction in the off premise experience. ","John Glass","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Glass. Our next question is from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim. Your line is open sir.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. I just had a follow-up and then a question specific to the Olive Garden and I guess what could be perceived as a slight shortfall versus what expectations were and then LongHorn's topping. Did the Olive Garden brand -- was that the only one that saw basically less incentives and had somewhat of a drag in the quarter or did LongHorn experience some of that as well?","Rick Cardenas","LongHorn didn't have the same drag as Olive Garden did. There was much more reduction in incentives in Olive Garden than LongHorn for the quarter. ","Matthew DiFrisco","And where are we in that cycle of reductions, are we going to expect that to continue into the first half of 2020 or are we starting to maybe now see more comparable year-over-year comparisons on incentives? ","Rick Cardenas","I think when we get to the middle of the beginning and beginning the middle of the second quarter of last year when we started to start to really pull back. It is going to be a little bit more time before we wrap that. ","Matthew DiFrisco","And then my last question you mentioned a lot about some of the competition coming in and where you would grow a store, the obvious place would be sort of where Capital Grille already sits or some other of your brands but as far as the real estate availability say for the next three to five years what are you seeing out there for the potential for the Cheddar's brand and those brands that are lower, that are positioned best for the lower income consumer or the broader consumer base. A lot of been said that there's not a lot of availability, do you feel the same or do you think the brand is something that can fit into more locations maybe than some other brands that I have commented about in tight locations? ","Gene Lee","Well I think we have a lot of green space right. So we're still relatively under penetrated so that gives you a lot more opportunity. So obviously a lot easier for us to find sites for Cheddar's than it is for Olive Garden. I don't see availability being an issue for Cheddar's long-term growth whereas Olive Garden now -- I mean everything that we do with Olive Garden we have to really figure out what the cannibalization is going to be versus we don't have that much of an issue with Cheddar's. So, I think it all depends on what's your size, what's your penetration level. I don't see that as a burden as we move forward with Cheddar's. ","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. DiFrisco. Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open. ","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great, thank you very much. Two questions, one just on the fiscal 2020 guidance. I'm just wondering if there was anything in the fiscal fourth quarter just ended, whether it would be slower and more volatile comps or maybe higher than expected costs, anything there that might have led you to temper your initial fiscal 2020 guidance? I know if you look at past years like initial guidance was still a conservative allowing for a beaten raise which Gene I know that's critical component just to guide conservatively but looking back to fiscal 2019 comp at 75 basis point should be earnings growth by 700 percentage points so, just wondering as you think about your initial guidance for 2020 how that was impacted by the most recent trends in the industry and then I had one follow up?","Rick Cardenas","Hi Jeff, this is Rick. Yes, I am assuming you are talking about our same-restaurant sales guidance of 1 or 2. Gene mentioned we are seeing a little bit more volatility in the industry and this is an annual guidance, this is 12 months ahead of time. And so we want to make sure that we're prudent and being at the lower end of our 1% to 3% range makes sense. We also have seen a little bit of a slowdown in discretionary spending in this calendar year versus last calendar year. So we feel like 1% to 2% is the right range at this time.","Jeffrey Bernstein","And from an earnings per share perspective would you view that similarly in terms of a little more cautious to start the year?","Rick Cardenas","I wouldn't say it's a little bit more cautious to start the year than we've been in the past. We have a few things, one is our same-restaurant sales of 1% to 2% with a little bit more inflation that we've seen in the past. And also a big difference in tax rate year-over-year will impact our EPS. ","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got it and my follow-up was just on the unit guidance for fiscal 2020. On net basis we are looking at roughly 2.5% growth, I'm just wondering if you can give some color in terms of where Olive Garden and LongHorn will fall into that and confidence in Cheddar's maybe accelerating or is Cheddar's still in wait and see mode?","Gene Lee","Jeff, first of all in the broad picture the total number of openings that we have this year will be very similar to last year. The difference is the openings will fall a little bit later in the fiscal year than they did this year just because of construction and developers not necessarily meeting the timelines that they had originally. So, well our openings will be about the same, our timing will be a little bit different. The total percent from Olive Garden and LongHorn is about a little bit over half of our total openings which isn't that different than we've had this year. Cheddar's will have about the same pace as last year.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got you, thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Bernstein. Our next question is from Andrew Strelzik with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open sir. ","Andrew Strelzik","Hey, good morning, two things from me. First, a number of the casual diners that have pulled back on promotional activity are actually performing from a same store sales perspective among the best in the group. I am just wondering do you think the consumer sensitivity to discounting has made me lessen the bid or it is less disruptive than it has been in the past with more everyday value on menus across the group that's first? And second, the conversation on African swine fever has picked up and I saw that you increased the commodity inflation relative to last year, how did that play into your thinking, how comfortable are you with that and how it may impact Darden? Thanks. ","Gene Lee","You know on the everyday value question and then sensitivity promotions I think there has been a lot of good work done in the industry over the last couple of years to put more everyday value in. And we've been saying for a while that the consumer didn't want to be told what they had to do, what they had to buy to get that value. And I think a lot of people have rotated to more everyday value and to be able to do that means that you have to be less promotional like when you make that strategic choice. So, I think there's not much more for me to add there other than I believe we kind of lead the way with everyday value others have followed. I think it's the right thing to do and it tones down the promotional activity. Rick will talk about the other question. ","Rick Cardenas","As it relates to African swine flu a couple of things, one is pork represents approximately 2% of our total buy. So it's really a small impact and it has very, very small impact on our guide. It's going to take 18 to 36 months for this to work itself out. We're currently not seeing a huge increase in pricing but we expect to see some more of that in the back half of the year and that's already contemplated in our inflation numbers.","Andrew Strelzik","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Strelzik. Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Your line is open. ","Dennis Geiger","Thank you. Gene, I wanted to ask a bit about the strength of operational execution at Olive Garden which you often identify as the biggest driver of the brand success and probably the largest sales driver. So, just wondering if you could talk more about ops execution in the quarter, if it remained as strong as what you've seen in recent quarters? And then I guess just more importantly if you could frame the runway from here for operations and throughput specifically to be a continued driver of performance as we look ahead through the balance of the year? Thanks. ","Gene Lee","The team continues to make progress on improving operational execution. There's always pockets in the system, the size of Olive Garden that has opportunities. There's always opportunities day-to-day, week-to-week to improve your overall execution. When you think about the size of Olive Garden and the number of servers that we have on each and every day there's always -- we always break down a little bit. So, every day that we break down a little bit less more guests have a better experience. The key to this long-term are continued simplification and I believe that management and the operating team inside Olive Garden is really focused on taking it to -- the simplification to the next level and that could drive even further improvements in overall execution for the next couple years. Throughput will always continue to be an opportunity. We were very effective from an advertising standpoint. A lot of our advertising drives people on Friday and Saturday night and we have long waits in our restaurants and that's -- we talk a lot about convenience and that's not very convenient. And consequently we've got to get better at making that experience more convenient for the consumer and we've got to get -- we have to get more people and guest through our restaurants each hour and shorten up those dining experiences. So we're going to continue to focus on this and we think it's a big upside. ","Dennis Geiger","Great, and then just if I could just recognizing you've given a lot of the key guidance pieces which is great, can you also just summarize your expectations thinking about EBIT margins for the year maybe relative to the long-term framework, if there's anything else you could add there specific to that item? Thanks. ","Rick Cardenas","Yeah Dennis, this is Rick. Our EBIT margin will be within our long-term framework and our long-term framework as a reminder is 10 to 30 basis points. ","Dennis Geiger","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Geiger. Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. Your line is open. ","John Ivankoe","Hi, thank you. I wanted to go back to off premise for Olive Garden. Obviously at 15% of sales it's actually getting pretty big on a per store basis. Gene you mentioned enhancing capability, I think that was announced around off premise. How big do you think that can be on a first quarter basis, how much would you want it to be obviously considering that much of that business is going to come when you are the busiest on the Friday or Saturday night?","Gene Lee","I think that that's always going to depend on consumer demand. I think improving our capabilities is going to be an important part of growing this. We just opened a new prototype in Orlando that has a full dedicated off premise area. We're learning a lot from that. We think that has tremendous upside for our higher volume off premise restaurants. We have restaurants now doing well over a $1 million off premise. A lot of this business comes in and it's out the door before 11:30. And a lot of the catering that we're starting do now is really off -- it is pre the big meal period. And so that's really helpful. So we've got multiple projects going on today to improve our capabilities and then we think there's some attachment opportunities. Can we attach additional sales to the normal off premise experience, an example, if we start building these takeout spaces can we get some more beverage sale, can we get other attachment. We're still in the infancy of thinking about that but we think it's a fairly big idea which could grow that overall percentage over time. I think the way to summarize this is that we see tremendous opportunity in this space without sacrificing what we're really here to do which has created great in restaurant experience.","John Ivankoe","Okay, and how big of a capital project would one of these dedicated takeout spaces be in an existing restaurant?","Gene Lee","You know it's too early -- John, it's too early to really talk about that. But every restaurant we've got to figure out in the multiple and the different prototypes we have where we would add it, it has to be added in a specific place where you can staff it in your downtime without adding a lot of labor. You want proximity to the kitchen, you have the right heating and holding areas. And so I don't want to put a price tag on it right yet, we're still too early in that process. ","John Ivankoe","Helpful, thank you.","Operator","And thank you for your question Mr. Ivankoe. Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Your line is open ma'am.","Sara Senatore","Thank you. I have a follow up actually on Olive Garden and then a question on Cheddar's. On Olive Garden, I know you have said that in the past you are trying to reduce mix and also obviously you talked about planning [ph] and commercial activity. I guess margins seem fairly flat versus last year so I was just trying to understand a little bit about how to think about the tradeoff between your comp and margin or traffic and mix, however, you think about the complexion of the comp and how that associate to margin? And then I have a question on Cheddar's. ","Rick Cardenas","I think the margin impact in the quarter had a lot more to do with the investment we made with the Chicken Alfredo which ticked up with the 50% more chicken which ticked up our cost of sales. And then we had a promotional construct, it was pretty similar to last year at the same time. We didn\u2019t have the trade up opportunity that was driving a lot of mix. At the end of the day when you look at that Olive Garden margin there's no one out there in this space that has those types of margins and we're going to continue to invest in value which may limit the upward mobility of that. We don't expect margins to contract but I want to make sure that we're investing properly into that business.","Sara Senatore","Okay, thank you. And then on Cheddar's a couple of comments just about -- you talked about maybe not having as much scale. You also talked about franchise businesses continue to be a much bigger drag certainly than the formerly franchised. And the rest I guess, as you think about that just -- one is I guess to be Darden scale was a big part of where the value creation could be, with respect to Cheddar's I am just trying to understand how you think about scale in the context of the brand that's smaller but as a part of a very large system like Darden? And then also do you contemplate -- would you ever contemplate being a bit more drastic with the former franchise restaurant, I assume they are still covering that cost capital but at some point does it ever make sense to close them or to think about them differently? ","Rick Cardenas","No, I mean I'll start with the latter part of that question. These restaurants that are driving the comp down are still extremely busy. They're high -- most them are very high volume restaurants that are leaking back down to more of the system average. So these are still great restaurants. On average they still produce good returns. They've been through the most change and that I think has created the most -- these have been the most disrupted restaurants. And I think that's why we're seeing a lot of the same-restaurant sales decline come from those restaurants. The destruction -- the biggest interruptions [ph] been total management change, total system change, everything that they do day in and day out has just changed operationally. And they've had some tough times adjusting. ","But overall these are great restaurants and great territories so there's no drastic we're going to close these things. I think when you look at it and Rick alluded to it and I talked about it we made more money in Cheddar's this quarter than we did last quarter. And the thing I am really excited about in Cheddar's when we really look at it and dissect it our guest counts improve Q3 to Q4 against the industry, 160 basis points. As the industry weakens Cheddar's guest counts actually improve. So I mean we're making progress. ","One more thing on Cheddar's that I didn't talk about in my prepared remarks but I think it's important to recognize is that we've been transforming these kitchens in the last year. We've done approximately 100 of them. We did 34 in the fourth quarter. This is a very disruptive process and the majority of the transformation this quarter were done in the formerly franchised restaurants. This transformation allows us to really improve the efficiency in labor, improve the speed of service with the food coming out of the kitchen. These were big, big moves. This is behind us and we're really excited about this and we think that this is going to have a big impact. ","One of the things that we do know is that there is a significant sales decline after we do transformation as the team struggled with this new operating procedure. But that works its way out. As far as scale goes I think my reference scale was more about just the overall size of the brand and the future growth opportunities. Today Cheddar's is definitely benefiting from our scale. It's plugged into our supply chain. It's been a huge benefit for them, it's allowed us to really continue to focus on value for the consumer. And so I think scale is working for them on that side. They're going to benefit from our data scale over time. And most importantly I think the thing that I can see you focus on is can we get these human resource metrics closer to our Darden norms. I think when that happens that's where we're going to see some really great growth.","Sara Senatore","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you for your question Ms. Senatore. Our last question is from Stephen Anderson with Maxim Group. Your line is open sir.","Stephen Anderson","Yes. Thank you. Wanted to ask about the rewards program you have in tests it is about 130 restaurants or so. I wanted to ask what progress you've seen, what you have learned from that experience, and perhaps any plan to expand that program? Thank you. ","Rick Cardenas","We continue to have the rewards program in test. We continue to analyze what's happening there. There's some really positive in that program. There's some challenges with that program. We're going to continue to observe this and figure out whether we can drive greater loyalty with it. If not we'll dissolve it. And at this point in time we have no plans to roll it out. We have no plans to dissolve it. We continue to observe that consumer behavior.","Stephen Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Anderson. We do have a question from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Your line is open sir.","Brian Vaccaro","Thanks. Just wanted to -- just hoping to circle back on third party delivery. Gene we have seen some concepts that has been hesitant historically, sort of recently announced a launching delivery and it seems more broadly that the economics for restaurants and maybe people of those large chains could be improving. Would you agree with that and I heard your earlier comments but are we getting closer to the point where it makes sense to pursue that opportunity with the existing off premise growth moderating here? Thank you. ","Gene Lee","Well no, I think that the economics are -- the burden of third party delivery is being shifted to the company to the consumer. People are -- what I'm seeing is brands moving that burden away from themselves and on to the consumer. And at this point I'm just a little uncomfortable with that what percentage is the consumer long-term willing to pay off their overall check to have that convenience. And that has to be proved out to me over time if that's something that we want to do. We're still in a value proposition and I'm just not sure. I'm watching what everybody is -- we're watching what everybody's doing. We continue to believe especially in Olive Garden that it's much better for us to focus on the catering and delivery part of this. We've just made -- we've just changed how we think about that. We've put the size -- dollar size of the order now has move from $100 to $75 and we've moved from 24 hour notice to 5 o'clock the day before. We think that that is a strong move and we are very interested in delivering ourselves to people who want to have a food experience delivered over $75. And again the average order of that activity for us is well over $300. It's a highly rated from a satisfaction standpoint event and we want to focus on that more so than trying to move a $15 entree.","And so, we're watching what's happening. We don't think that the economic burdens change that much. We think it's just been shifted from the restaurant to the consumer. ","Brian Vaccaro","Yes, understood, that makes sense. And then just back to the changes you made on your existing off premise to pricing and the order time, when was that put in place again literally like this quarter or was that partially through our fiscal 4Q?","Gene Lee","It's just being put in place now. ","Brian Vaccaro","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question Mr. Vaccaro. I would now turn the conference back over to Kevin Kalicak for closing remarks. ","Kevin Kalicak","Alright, thanks Jill. With that that concludes our call. I want to remind everybody that we plan to release first quarter results on Thursday, September 19th before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks again for participating in today's call.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for participating.

These results were available on PR Newswire and other wire services. We recognize that most of you reviewed our first quarter results, so we won't take time to go through them in detail in an effort to provide more time for your questions. We will offer a line item summary of the P&L, discuss our financial outlook for fiscal 2014 and discuss our brand-by-brand operating performance summary.","With that, let me turn it over to Clarence.","Clarence Otis","Thank you, Matthew. From a same-restaurant sales prospective, this was a difficult quarter for the restaurant industry generally, in casual dining in particular, and obviously, was a difficult quarter for us. This summer's sharp spike down in comparable sales within casual dining follows, I think we all know, were some pronounced spikes up and down this past winter and spring. And so we've concluded that as the sluggish and uneven economic recovery we've been experiencing for some time now persists, we can expect appreciably greater sales volatility in our industry. And it's important for us to be appropriately prepared for that because with the changes that we're making at our 2 largest brands, that volatility is amplified here at Darden. And so as a result of that, we've taken steps that will reduce our operating support spending by $50 million a year on an ongoing basis beginning next year, or fiscal 2015.","For this year, fiscal 2014, the reduction will be approximately $25 million, and that will be offset by approximately $10 million of upfront costs to implement the plan. And the plan does involve the elimination of a meaningful number of support positions, about 85. And out of respect for the people who are affected most directly, we won't get into a great deal of detail about what it entails. What's important is that these actions provide us with the financial flexibility in the face of heightened volatility to do 2 things we need to do to regain operating momentum: invest in providing affordability to those guests who need more affordability and invest in refining our offers in ways that are responsive to guests who are more focused on other attributes of their dining experiences.","And with that, let me turn it over to Brad to provide some financial detail about the first quarter.","C. Bradford Richmond","Thank you, Clarence, and good morning to everyone. Our first quarter financial results were clearly short of what we expected when we spoke to you in June, largely because same-restaurant sales and the guest counts were below our expectations.","First quarter financial results were also adversely affected by 2 unusual items that, together, total approximately $0.03 EPS. First, there was a legal settlement related to a trademark issue that unfavorably impact net earnings, and the additional administrative costs associated with the reduction in our total unit growth that we had not factored in. Looking forward to the second quarter, I want to remind you that unlike last year, this year, the Thanksgiving holiday week, which is a soft week for us since we are closed on Thanksgiving, does not fall into the second quarter. Instead, it falls into our fiscal third quarter. We anticipate that the Thanksgiving holiday shift will benefit second quarter blended same-restaurant sales by approximately 100 basis points, and adversely affect third quarter blended same-restaurant sales by a similar amount.","Additionally, the spending -- support spending actions that we announced today will adversely affect second quarter earnings. Although as Clarence said, there is a meaningful benefit for this fiscal year as a whole.","In the second quarter, there will be an approximately $10 million upfront cost, offset by $3 million of savings in the quarter. The balance of the savings, about $22 million, will be spread pretty evenly across the third and fourth quarters.","All of the costs incurred in the second quarter will be in the selling, general and administrative expense line.","As we look ahead to the fiscal year, our outlook for total sales and earnings remains the same as it was when we spoke to you at the beginning of the first quarter. We still anticipate total sales growth in the range of 6% to 8%, and we expect blended same-restaurant sales for our larger brands to be flat, which is at the bottom of the 0% to 2% range we discussed in June.","We also still anticipate that diluted net earnings per share will be down 3% to down 5%, with the combined benefit of our support spending reduction and the postponement of some of the provisions of the Affordable Health Care Act offsetting the softer-than-expected first quarter earnings.","It is important to note that our blended same-restaurant sales expectations for our 3 large brands does assume that same-restaurant sales for the casual dining industry will rebound from what we saw in the first quarter, which, using our fiscal calendar, was the lowest quarterly results in over 3 years. Our outlook assumes that comparable sales for the industry are flat for the balance of the year.","Turning more specifically to the first quarter, Darden's total sales from continuing operations increased 6.1% to $2.16 billion. On a blended same-restaurant sales basis, the results for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse declined 3.3% in the quarter, with strength at LongHorn Steakhouse offset by weakness at Olive Garden and Red Lobster. And we saw continued same-restaurant sales gains in our specialty restaurant group with 0.5% same-restaurant sales growth on a blended basis.","Food and beverage expenses for the first quarter were approximately 10 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis. This unfavorability was driven by a higher land-based protein and dairy cost. For the first quarter, restaurant labor expenses were approximately 110 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to wage inflation, reduced productivity and sales deleverage at Olive Garden and Red Lobster.","Restaurant expenses in the quarter were approximately 140 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis because of the impact of adding Yard House. Since with their restaurant base that's 100% leased, it runs higher restaurant expense as a percentage of sales than our other brand. This represents about 1\/4 of the increase on a year-over-year basis. And we had higher repair and maintenance cost across all brands, as well as the sales deleveraging impact at Olive Garden and Red Lobster.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat on a percentage of sales basis due to increase in media and media inflation, that was offset broadly by reduced spending. Depreciation expense in the quarter was approximately 35 basis points higher on a percentage of sales basis compared to last year because of the increase in new units and the remodel programs at our larger brands.","Our tax rate this quarter was 20.8%, was about 330 basis points lower than the prior year, driven by increases in available tax credits and our tax planning initiatives. We continue to estimate that our annual effective tax rate will be approximately 20%, which is about 100 basis points lower than last year's effective tax rate. This annual effective tax rate though will vary from quarter-to-quarter. In the first quarter, reported total company operating profit margins fell by approximately 300 basis points compared to the prior year.","Now turning to our commodity cost outlook. We have approximately 84% of our total food spend contracted through the second quarter of 2014, that's our fiscal year. And we have 38% of our total spend contracted to the end of the fiscal year. We have not fully covered our usage through the fiscal year because we believe that premiums for future contracts are simply too great given where we expect prices to be in the cash market as we look forward.","Food inflation in the first quarter was approximately 2%, with beef and chicken inflation in the mid-single-digit range and dairy inflation in the low double-digit range. Seafood inflation was nominal, but we now expect double-digit inflation in the second, third and fourth quarters primarily related to the shrimp production [ph] issues in Asia. The source of the problem has been identified, but getting solutions in place is taking a little longer than we expected when we spoke to you in June. For the fiscal year, our current expectation is that our commodity baskets will see a net inflation in the range of 2.5% to 3%, which is about 50 basis points higher than we expected in June, again driven primarily by shrimp.","Category by category, through the second quarter of fiscal 2014, seafood costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with 100% of our usage covered; beef costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with 75% of our usage covered; poultry costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with the 100% of our usage covered; wheat costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with 65% of our usage covered; and dairy costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with 55% of our usage covered.","Our energy costs are expected to be slightly unfavorable [indiscernible] on a year-over-year basis and we have contracted majority of our natural gas and electricity usage in the deregulated markets in which we operate, through the second quarter of fiscal 2014.","And now I'll turn it over to Drew to comment on Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, and then Gene will discuss the Specialty Restaurant Group.","Andrew H. Madsen","Thank you, Brad. And as Brad just said this morning. I'm going to comment briefly on the fiscal 2014 first quarter results and key sales dynamics at each of our 3 large casual dining brands.","Now as a reminder, on our June call, we outlined the 3 strategic priorities that each of our large brands was going to focus on this year to regain same-restaurant traffic momentum, which is our top priority. And those 3 are: first, delivering our current guest experiences at a competitively superior level more consistently across all our restaurants; improving affordability; and third, evolving the experiences that each of our brands offers so that they remain responsive to what our guests want beyond affordability.","Now LongHorn has executed effectively against all 3 of these strategic priorities and that's reflected in their strong sales performance. Same-restaurant guest counts increased 1.4% during the first quarter and exceeded our industry estimate by approximately 490 basis points. Same-restaurant sales were 3.2% above prior year and exceeded our industry estimate by 520 basis points.","All measures of operations execution and guests satisfaction continue to improve at our LongHorn, and most notably, their 2 key focus areas of server attentiveness and steaks grilled correctly. In addition, our focus on our lowest performing restaurants is paying off, where the pace of progress on steaks grilled correctly in the bottom quartile is nearly triple the system average. The first quarter was supported by 2 6-week promotions. The first promotion, Steaks that Sizzle, featured 3 new affordable steak dishes priced at $11.99. The second promotion, Fresh Favorites, did not have a price point and reinforced our fresh, never frozen steak, chicken and fish brand equity by featuring 3 core menu entrees, Outlaw Ribeye, Parmesan Crusted Chicken and LongHorn Salmon. Both of these promotions performed well.","In addition, we introduced the first of 2 new core menu platforms designed to broaden brand relevance and appeal, especially for those guests who are looking for high-quality, on-trend and distinctive dishes. Peak Season is our platform to bring seasonal news to the appetizer, drink, dessert and side dish categories. Summer choices featured in the first quarter included a Parmesan-crusted asparagus appetizer, fire-grilled corn on the cob side dish and a ranch house cob salad.","In addition, this month, we just launched Chef's Showcase, which offers our guests entr\u00e9es inspired by fine dining at casual dining prices. We're currently offering Porcini Portabella Ribeye and Pork Osso Buco.","","Despite the strong sales performance, operating profit was below prior year because of our decision to price below elevated levels of beef inflation. Plus, there was 1 extra week of advertising support during the quarter. For the full year, we expect the weeks of advertising support to be the same as last year.","Olive Garden same-restaurant guest counts declined 3.8% during the first quarter. This performance trailed our estimate for the industry by approximately 30 basis points. Same-restaurant sales declined 4% and trailed our industry estimate by approximately 200 basis points. Now we're certainly disappointed with our performance at Olive Garden during the first quarter, especially given the improving guest count momentum that was achieved during the fourth quarter last year. Now we have achieved significant progress at Olive Garden on the first strategic priority, to deliver our guest experiences at a competitively superior level, more consistently across all restaurants. In fact, all guest experience measures are well above prior year, especially food taste, value and affordability. And false weights have also been reduced to all-time lows. In addition, we're ahead of schedule with the initial phase of our culinary simplification plan, which we believe will enable more consistent guest experience delivery.","We also experienced less check erosion during the first quarter this year compared to the fourth quarter last year, especially during July and August and we expect this trend to continue as we wrap on similar prior year promotion constructs. Our biggest challenge was obviously guests counts, due to weaker overall industry conditions and 1 promotion that did not perform as well as expected in July. More specifically, we exceeded our estimate for industry guest counts during June when we advertised 3-course Italian dinner for $12.95. But we trailed our industry estimate during July when we advertised 2 Italian dinners for $25, which we believe was primarily the result of this promotion not having enough news to wrap on its successful debut at the same time last year. And then, we exceeded the industry again during August behind Never Ending Pasta Bowl.","We're also continuing to evolve the Olive Garden experience so that it responds to what guests want beyond affordability. During the first quarter, this included the introduction of a new small plates platform called Taste of Italy, which offers our guests a more flexible and affordable way to enjoy their Olive Garden experience. And shortly, we'll be expanding the small plates section.","We plan to begin the expansion of our remodel program at Olive Garden for all non-Tuscan farmhouse restaurants during the second half of fiscal 2014. And we're planning to open 15 restaurants in fiscal 2014, a reduction from the 36 restaurants we opened in fiscal 2013, which will allow our restaurant and leadership teams more time to focus on existing guests while building a stronger foundation for pursuing new guests and new occasions.","Red Lobster same-restaurant guest counts decreased 5.9% in the first quarter. This performance trailed our industry estimate by approximately 220 basis points. Same-restaurant sales declined 5.2% and trailed our industry estimate by approximately 320 basis points. So similar to Olive Garden, we're disappointed with this performance, especially following the improved traffic and sales results at Red Lobster during the fourth quarter last year.","Guest satisfaction improved noticeably during the first quarter, especially value, server attentiveness and pace of meal, driven largely by a return to 3 table service stations at the end of last year. And after 3 consecutive quarters of decline, checks increased versus the first quarter last year by 70 basis points and improved sequentially by 170 basis points compared to the fourth quarter. But our first 2 promotions, Seaside Mix & Match plus Four Course Seafood Feast did not perform up to expectations during June and July when we trailed our industry estimate on guest counts. During August, we performed in line with our industry estimate for guest counts, supported by Endless Shrimp, which we increased $1 back to the historical price point of $15.99.","Now looking forward, next month, we will launch an initiative led by our directors of operations who will spend considerably more of their time in our lower performing restaurants, working with the management teams in a very hands-on manner to help elevate execution to standard, particularly on controllable cost management and especially on labor. And in November, we'll focus on improving culinary execution through some reduction in core menu complexity and by optimizing our food preparation model to help better position all our restaurant teams for success. We're on pace to complete approximately 100 remodels in fiscal 2014, and we expect to end the year with over 90% of our restaurants completed.","And now Gene will talk about the Specialty Restaurant Group.","Eugene I. Lee","Thanks, Drew. The Specialty Restaurant Group delivered solid performance in the first quarter. Total sales for the quarter exceeded $281 million, which is 72.7% increase from the prior year. This growth was the result of our 65 net new restaurants across the group, which includes 46 Yard House restaurants and blended same-restaurant sales growth of 0.5. The Specialty Restaurant Group continues to deliver consistent sales growth with 14 consecutive quarters of blended same-restaurant sales growth. There was decline at Seasons and there are 2 issues contributing to this sales decline in Q1. First, we've made adjustments to the summer menu we believe will benefit us in the long term. However, these changes have resulted in a decline in check average. Second, there are 3 restaurants in a comparable base that significantly exceeded our expectations when they opened, but their sales have continued to decline well after the typical honeymoon period. However, their current performance is still well above our original expectations. The team is committed to improving the same-restaurant sales trends at Seasons 52 in the short-term while ensuring the brand remains healthy in the long term.","In the first quarter, we opened an additional 6 restaurants over last year, and excluding opening expenses associated with these additional restaurants, the Specialty Restaurant Group grew operating profit year-over-year. Specialty Restaurant Group plans to 22 restaurants for the remainder of fiscal 2014: 4 Capital Grilles, 1 Bahama Breeze, 8 Seasons 52s, 3 Eddie V's and 6 Yard Houses, for a total of 28 for the fiscal year. The group remains focused on improving operational execution, developing on-trend food and beverage offerings that drive sales and continuing to evolve the look and feel of our restaurants.","We are on track with our phase integration of Yard House. In the first quarter, both the supply chain distribution network and point of sale systems were converted. In the third quarter, Yard House will transition to Darden's benefits and bonus plans. Integration has been, and will always be, a distraction to restaurant operations. As the integration continues to wind down, we expect to regain same-restaurant sales momentum as the team is able to focus more in the core business. In addition, we are on track to achieve our targeted synergies.","As we look to the remainder of fiscal 2014, our fundamentals of the Specialty Restaurant Group remains strong. We're confident in our strategic priorities and are well-positioned to deliver our long-term growth commitments. And now, I'll turn it over back to Clarence.","Clarence Otis","Thanks, Gene. Now with the difficult actions we announced today and the steps we're taking to build same-restaurant traffic and sales momentum at our 2 large brands to complement same-restaurant and new restaurant growth at LongHorn Steakhouse and the Specialty Restaurant Group, we continue to believe our near-term earnings targets are reasonable, despite a much more challenging environment than we anticipated back in June. As Brad said however, that does depend on some improvement from what were unusually weak industry conditions in the first quarter. What's most important, though, from our perspective is sustained success. And that is our focus. An intense focus on sustained success is what enabled us to help pioneer our industry, it's what has helped us significantly widen our competitive gap to others in the industry over the past 10 years when it comes to both absolute sales per year and absolute cash flow per year, and it's the driving force as we take the step that we're taking today; steps that we believe will enable us to maintain a strong leadership position in our industry for years to come.","Two final comments. First, the action we announced today has been taken with considerable thought for our colleagues and friends who are moving on to other opportunities. We certainly wish them well. And given the company's long-standing values, we will support their transitions in a way that reflects their well-appreciated contributions to this organization.","Second, we also announced that after a long and successful career at Darden that culminated in his serving as our President and Chief Operating Officer for the past 9 years, Drew has announced that he's retiring from the company. And what a 9 years it's been. While the past year has had its challenges, Drew has helped build Darden into the clear industry leader. Over those 9 years, we've increased our restaurant base by 71%, our revenues have grown 79%, our earnings per share have doubled, and our total shareholder return's been more than 110%. But I know that from Drew's perspective, what's most important is that he's help make Darden a special place to be, one that has consistently strong employee engagement. And strong engagement is what's enabled Darden to be named one of FORTUNE's 100 place -- best places to work for 3 consecutive years, and we appreciate what Drew has done to get the company to this point.","With that, we'll take your questions. So let's get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Matthew DiFrisco at Lazard. My question's with respect to, I guess, just looking at the free cash flow. I might have missed this if you gave some guidance on that or updated the guidance on it. I heard you mentioned that in the second half of fiscal '14, you're going to resume the Olive Garden remodel, and that there's a 100 more remodels at Red Lobster. So can you give us an update as far as how that might affect your free cash flow and your CapEx budget in aggregate?","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, Matt, this is Brad. In the guidance we've given before in terms of our total cash flow, and our -- in this case CapEx, we'll incorporate that. We had some testing funds in for Red Lobster's -- or excuse me, for Olive Garden, so they will continue to that and Red Lobster will continue on their plan. So there's really no change in our overall cap expectations. We bounce a little bit around here and there, but no major changes there.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And then I guess I had a question with respect to the specialties division. Gene, I think you mentioned that there was the Yard House -- some integration issues. I guess looking at the comp, was that primarily the reason for the comp going negative, or are there some regional things maybe specific to its Southern California regional exposure?","Eugene I. Lee","I think the point we're trying to make, Matthew, is that every time we've done integration, we take the focus off of I think 100% on the guests onto implementing systems. So we've experienced that with LongHorn, we experienced with Eddie V's, and we think we're experiencing that somewhat in Yard House. We wouldn't say there's an issue with integration. We think integration is on track. But the point we're trying to make is that is a distraction. When you change every point of sale or POS terminal inside a restaurant, there is a distraction to every single employee. And until they become unconsciously confident with that, your service standards will drop a little bit. We think we're beyond that at this point in time, and we think that our restaurant operations are improving. And we would expect, if the conditions continues to stay the same or improve, we will see positive same-restaurant sales in Yard House in the next 6 to 12 months.","C. Bradford Richmond","Matt, Brad here. Let me just add a little bit more on our free cash -- on our CapEx guidance we provided before. We're saying $600 million to $650 million really working towards the middle of that range and so the adjustments we've talked about here still keeps us in the middle of that range, hopefully, in the bottom half of that range, but clearly probably more in the middle of the range.","Operator","For your next question, Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer & Co.","Michael Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. You talked about elevating your performance at your lowest performing units plus your brand...","Clarence Otis","Brian, we can't hear you on this side. If you could get closer to your microphone.","Michael Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","For improvement. And then related to the spending cuts, can you talk about any opportunities beyond $1 million [ph] annually? It sort of seems like this is the tip of the iceberg. I just want...","Matthew Stroud","Yes, Kathy, we can't hear him. Brian, can you either pick up your headset or requeue. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go to the next question. Michael Kelter, Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, on the $50 million of cost cuts, you mentioned a reduction of 85 support positions. But you, also in the release, mentioned, beyond the workforce reductions, there were program spending cuts. To what were you referring when you said program spending cuts? And then could you help with the $50 million number overall? Are you confident that there's not more you could do? That that's all you can cut at the organization level?","Clarence Otis","Yes, I would say on the program side, we are talking about a number of different initiatives across several functions that we think are value-added initiatives but lower priority than some of the other things that we need to focus on. And so that spans marketing and it also includes some of the things that we've been doing on the supply chain side. So it touches a lot of different places, but it adds up to a meaningful part of that total, that $50 million. I would say that with the cuts that we made, we're pretty comfortable that $50 million, on an ongoing basis, is a reduction. There is the possibility it could be somewhat higher than that, but that's the number we're comfortable with right now. And with that number, we still are able to make the investments that we need to make beyond affordability. And so we are investing in a number of things that we think we need to invest in to stay relevant to our guests as their lifestyles change. And so we're continuing to invest in making our technology platform more robust, for example, so we can better engage with our customers on a -- or from a digital perspective. It also sets up, we think, our opportunity to do a much more segmented, targeted, one-on-one marketing with our customers. And ultimately, hopefully, that will allow us to scale back our broadcast media spend.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then separately, your free cash flow this quarter post dividend payment was firmly negative. Was there anything particular about the quarter? Or is this a dynamic we're going to have to expect until the business turns around? And given that dynamic, doesn't it make sense to cut CapEx further until the business stabilizes?","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, Michael, Brad here. There are some seasonality to our cash flows, particularly as we look for the year and features that we may run in the different brands during the time. So it is down, principally driven by the earnings that we reported. But in terms of the -- our annual expectations with the guidance we've given, we still feel comfortable with that range. And to the tune of CapEx and opportunities there, we continue to look at those. We're still seeing approximately 80 net new restaurants this year. That's still a pretty good number. If anything, we may be 1 or 2 shy of that versus 1 or 2 over that. But we continue to evaluate those opportunities as we go through the year. But we don't see what we're looking at any need to make more significant adjustments other than the adjustment that Clarence talked about earlier in terms of our support cost.","Operator","Your next question, David Tarantino, Robert W. Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And Drew, best of luck as you move towards retirement. And Gene, congratulations on your promotion. My question is for Gene. I was just wondering if you could share some initial thoughts on any changes that you might make in the strategic direction or any opportunities that you see that you might implement as you move into leading the entire Darden enterprise?","Eugene I. Lee","I think that what we've outlined is the 2 issues or the 2 issues that need to be addressed. We have to address affordability. We also have to address the need of the consumer who can afford to spend more. And we need to make sure that we continue to improve that part of what we deliver to each and every guest. As far as saying anything more at this point in time, I think, would be irresponsible. What they say, a prescription without diagnosis is malpractice and I really would like to have some time to get to talk to the team in great detail, learn a little bit more about each of the businesses. But one thing I would say is that through my lens, I start from an operational perspective and I hope to bring a little bit more focus operationally to the businesses and that's just my roots. That's where I come from. So at this point, that's really all I want to say and I'll probably have more comments when we get together in December.","Operator","The next question, Jason West, Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just want to talk about some of the comments around the industry and the sales volatility, and you guys said some of the changes that you're making at Olive Garden and Red Lobster are somewhat exacerbating the volatility, which we certainly saw from the monthly trends. Just wondering if you could talk more about what's driving that volatility and then just the bigger picture of kind of driving positive comps that you need in the rest of the year to get to the guidance.","Clarence Otis","Yes, I would say, as we look at the industry, it was a surprisingly weak summer, given the macro numbers, where we didn't see dramatic change in the economic macro numbers. I mean, still anemic growth, but nevertheless growth. Same thing at the beginning of the year from a macro perspective. But if you look back to the beginning of this calendar year, we've seen some pretty -- more pronounced volatility than we've been seeing before. So some pretty big downward spikes, February comes to mind, followed by some reasonably big up spikes and then we saw the down spike this summer. So as this sluggishness persists, we're getting amplified volatility and hard to say why. I mean, there's been a lot of speculation that consumers have deferred some big ticket expenditures on auto, on appliances, some other things. And as they are forced sort of 6, 7 years into this to replace those, with relatively flat budgets, they've got to do some more disciplined budgeting and dining out is one of the things that may be paying a price for that. We suspect there's some truth to that. And so all of that says that for a lot of consumers, I mean, we're on the right track and really trying to make sure that we provide them with the affordability that they need because they need affordability in order to dine out. We get a little bit more volatility because we're in the middle of change. I mean, we're transitioning and putting more affordability on the core menu than we've had in the past. Some of those things that we changed to, whether they're promotional or on the core menu work better than others. And so that's, I think, explaining our incremental volatility to the industry.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just the comments on the guidance, it implies comps will kind of turn positive here for the balance of the year. I mean, do you expect to see that in the near term? Or what gives you kind of confidence that you're going to outperform the industry with a positive comp in the next 3 quarters?","Clarence Otis","Yes, I would say a couple of things about the future. I mean, from a industry perspective, this first quarter was really an outlier in terms of the spike down. And so we do hope and expect that that's the case, and that we would see it, as I think Brad said, bounce back from -- it looks a little bit more flat for the balance of the year. That would still mean, for our fiscal year, the industry's slightly down and that's 1 point, 1.5 points worse than we thought when the year started because we thought that this fiscal year would look a lot like last fiscal year from an industry perspective. In terms of our brands, really beginning next quarter. And so first quarter last year, we were pretty much on top of the industry on an overall basis. Red Lobster, a little bit behind, yet Olive Garden sort of [ph] right on top and a little bit ahead and LongHorn, well ahead. But beginning in the second quarter last year, we started to lag more dramatically the second and third quarter. And then we responded to that with a more intensive focus on affordability. So from a year-over-year perspective, we've got softer comps than the industry and that drives some of our expectation.","Operator","Our next question, John Glass, Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, if I could just ask about the guidance overall. And as I understand it, you've maintained your guidance for the year. I think it's fair to say you missed your first quarter expectations, but sort of correct me if this was in line maybe with yours even though it was out of line with ours. You've talked about 50 basis points more food cost pressure. That's like another $45 million. And now your comp guidance's at the very low end of your range and you're cutting -- your cost cutting, I think, is just $15 million net. So how do you square that with getting to your same old guidance? Is there some offset? And in answering that, could you address this compensation expense? I think it was $0.35 you talked about. Is that now being adjusted down because of the performance in the first quarter?","Clarence Otis","Yes, I would -- I'll start and then hand it over to Brad. But clearly, your expectations for the first quarter are higher than ours. And so that means that your expectations for the balance of the year were lower than ours because you're sort of where we were for the entire year. And so there is some of that going on. We also, on the cost side, before the steps that we were taking as we outlined annual guidance, were pretty conservative. And so we had some places where we thought there was some opportunity to ratchet back spending beyond what we announced today. And that was in our guidance, and we're taking advantage of those opportunities.","C. Bradford Richmond","I think broadly a couple of unique items is the Affordable Care Act. We anticipated about $0.06 implementation cost of that as we begin the year. It's probably going to be half that cost, maybe a smidgen less because there were some parts that deferred but not all of it. And so we have some costs but that's a little bit of a benefit to our numbers. And I think more broadly is, as you step back and look at this, if you look at the margin contraction on a year-over-year basis, it was really in the second quarter of our prior fiscal year when we got a little bit more aggressive on our promotional pricing and some of that. So there was meaningful margin compression last fiscal year for the second, third and fourth quarter, will now be wrapping on that this year so we don't have as much of that margin contraction. That kind of get to Clarence's earlier points about the quarterly spread that you had. And then also, you saw some areas on a year-over-year basis; LongHorn had a price point -- or a feature that wasn't price pointed. You saw Red Lobster this year in the shrimp, shrimp costs are up. But they price that at $1 higher than the prior year. And even August vis-\u00e0-vis the industry, the consumers recognized that still as a good value. So those type of adjustments that we have planned for the remainder of the year, we won't go into those details at this point. But those are the factors that really help us as we work through the math to say what's a good expectation for our sales and our earnings performance. There's a little less sales, so we're going to do a little bit better through [ph] some of the cost initiatives that we talked about to improve the margins from where they were before to stay in that same earnings range.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And if I could follow up, just first if you can just maybe address the -- if the $0.35 compensation piece was adjusted or not? And then just wrap this in my second question as well, which is the volatility you're seeing in sales surprises me in that it's up and down versus the industry, so I understand you can't control the industry trends. Why do you think that volatility versus the industry exists? Is it because your own promotions continue to maybe not be as consistent -- it's an internal issue? Or are you continually being surprised by what the competition's coming out with and so you're reacting more or you are being hurt by those external forces and individual competitors moving the efficacy of one of your promotions around? Which do you think it is?","Clarence Otis","I think, as we look at same-restaurant sales, obviously, marginal guests are critical, so every incremental guest. And a lot of those incremental guests are driven by price and affordability. Our brands are at the top of the range when you look at the check average continuum in casual dining. And so when you get sentiment swings that affect consumer spending and consumers get more cautious, we're going to feel that a little bit more regardless of what else is going on and that's just a reality but that same reality is why our operating cash flows are as high as they are.","C. Bradford Richmond","And John, Brad here. On the comp part of your question, yes, I mean, we were below our expectations for the quarter. So we talked about approximately $0.35 year-over-year compensation headwinds. It's not that coming out now. We're not going to detail how much but it is less. But we built our expectations which is what that comp expense is built around. This quarter was not as strong as broadly the market was looking at that. So it was clearly a number of pennies [ph] that we had in the first quarter, but there's still a fair amount of that ahead of us in quarters 2 through 4.","Operator","The next question, Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Drew and Gene, my best wishes and congratulations as well. I have a question based on the -- Drew's departure. Dave Pickens was promoted in July to a position that sounded like he may have been in line to succeed Drew. And of course, that was not the case. So can you talk a little bit about that, give us some perspective on Dave's role and kind of the driver of the decision to move Gene over into the COO role?","Clarence Otis","That was not the intent when we made the move with Dave. We had a position that we feel is important, which is to have someone lead some important operations initiatives that cut across all the brands beyond what needs to get done day-to-day within each brand to support the business. And so we've got things, for example, like the Affordable Care Act rollout that cut across all the brands that requires senior leadership to really get developed and implemented appropriately. And so Dave is working on that. He's working on some other cross-brand operations initiatives that we've we don't want to talk about for competitive reasons. That's an important role and he'll continue to do that in support of Gene. I think as we looked at where to go when Drew announced his decision, we've got a lot of talented people. Gene has been in the restaurant business for 30 years. And he has seen a lot of different kinds of brands, mass market brands, specialty brands. He knows that broad range of customers. He has a terrific sort of intuitive feel for why people dine out, what they want out of restaurants, whether that restaurant's a diner or a fine dining restaurant. That intuitive feel, along with all the other things he learned over time, are important as we talk about refining the guest experiences that we provide to respond to guests' needs that are pretty dynamic. And so that operational background is very important. And Gene's also served as Chief Operating Officer of an enterprise, certainly not as big as Darden, but still, when you look at the restaurant business, a relatively large enterprise and that was rare, which was $1 billion plus in annualized revenues when we acquired it in 2007.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then a question on the CapEx. Brad, you said you would hope to be around the midpoint of the $600 million $650 million range. Given the industry weakness, are you making adjustments at this point to fiscal '15? What are your thoughts on the sort of the CapEx trends in fiscal '15?","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, we -- Jo, we continue to look at that. Like I said earlier, it's more likely to drift down than up for sure. We continue to look at those opportunities. And we're just -- as we look into next fiscal year because particularly the new unit component of that investment, which is the biggest part of that, biggest single part, those are long lead decisions, 12 to 18 months. So further dramatic revisions in the current year, not likely. We'll continue as we move this year to make adjustments that we see appropriate as we look at fiscal '15. But more likely to be down, with the exception of the SRG brand. Strong business model, strong brands performing well. We'll continue to invest strongly there.","Clarence Otis","And I would just add, Joe, when we talked a while ago, that as we look at '15, we're going to be pretty cautious, pretty focused on business trends as we think about Olive Garden. We're down the '15. And so we have the ability for sure to be flexible downward there and that's something that we preserve. And then even as we look at the brands that Brad mentioned growing more robustly, we're pretty focused on making sure that we don't get ahead of our sort of talent pipeline. And so this year, Gene talked about 8 restaurants at Seasons. That number is certainly not going to go up. And to the extent that it changes, it may go down slightly to make sure we don't get ahead of ourselves from a talent pipeline perspective.","Operator","Next question, Jeff Bernstein, Barclays.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two questions. Just first, a follow-up from a comp perspective. It seems like you guys are happy with the most recent August trend perhaps running ahead of the industry. But broadly with that volatility increasing and it being accentuated at your brands, just wondering whether you see that as a driver of maybe increased promotional intensity or can you size up what you're seeing in terms of the industry as they're dealing with this volatility and perhaps how you would like to position yourself in terms of your response? And obviously, you're trying to balance promotions versus long-term brand building. But just trying to get your sense for how the industry is dealing with this volatility.","Clarence Otis","Yes, I would say, Jeff, too early to tell. And so August was certainly better than July, which was really a tough month, down roughly 4% in the industry. But August was still a tough month, down about 1.7%, I think that's about right. A little too early to tell the industry response at this point.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But I mean, just more broadly, you talked about calendar '13 being volatile in February and July. I'm just wondering what you're seeing across the industry as everyone is battling with this kind of consumer sentiment volatility being so enhanced. What are you seeing in terms of the competitive landscape?","Clarence Otis","I think everyone's focused on their spending and their support platforms and making sure that they've got flexibility there. And so I don't think we are alone in that. Other people have more structural opportunities on the efficiency side than we might have in some areas that we've already addressed, so supply chain, for example, and some of the inter-restaurant systems. But the moves that we announced today really are enabled by some steps that we've taken in the last couple of years. So in marketing, for example, we've separated responsibility for current periods. So that tactic's from responsibility for multi-year evolution that allows us to be more efficient from a support staffing perspective actually and marketing and operations. We've got some -- a new multiunit leadership level that we feel enables us to have somewhat wider spans of control at the old leadership levels. On the support side, the technology work that we're doing further automates not just supply chain but a lot of the data collection, data mining, operational and financial reporting, and that allows for some efficiency from personnel perspective as well.","Operator","Next question, Will Slabaugh, Stephens.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Could you help us figure out what's going on relative to your intent of the lower entry price point promotions and then how you think those are being perceived by the guests and how that's mixing in the check? I guess, I'm just trying to get at the lack of traffic impact there from those promotions.","Andrew H. Madsen","I'm sorry, I didn't hear the very last part of your question?","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes, just saying I'm trying to get to the lack of traffic impact from those lower price point promotions?","Andrew H. Madsen","Yes, I think the biggest question there is making frameworks that we've got, like 2 for $25 or a 3-course meal, even more distinctive by each brand. So there's been a couple of questions about, do we need to increase our intensity promotionally? We don't think we do. We dialed that up last year already, and we'll be wrapping on that, as I think Brad mentioned earlier, over the next 3 quarters. So we don't think we need to dial it up. We think that we need to refine it in a way that does a better job of bringing in the incremental guests and not just trading existing guests to a somewhat lower priced dish, which is what happened with Red Lobster in particular in June. And you can see that way it's working at LongHorn and that's ultimately what we want to move towards.","C. Bradford Richmond","Will, Brad. I think to only thing I'd add to Drew's comment is we talk more about same-restaurant sales, we also have additional insight of the traffic. We -- our 3 large brands have been above the industry on traffic. They were this most recent quarter, as well as the prior quarter. So building the traffic and keeping our brands in front of the consumers during this time. We're making good progress there. Obviously, we want to build the check as well but we can be patient and build the business for the longer term, more so than just the particular quarter that we're in.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Got you. And as a quick follow-up there, it sounds like your plan for the year assumes some improvement in the restaurant macro environment, and correct me if I'm wrong there. But could you talk, just assuming that things don't improve, what that free cash flow generation outlook might be and what you would start to look to, either cut cutbacks or et cetera to preserve that dividend?","C. Bradford Richmond","Yes, we have said on an annual basis, one point of same-restaurant sales for us is in the neighborhood of $0.15 EPS and so you can work that back into the cash flow. But even as you see a little bit in the first quarter, a company of our size, a large balance sheet like -- that we have, there are other opportunities that we're working on to enhance our cash flow opportunities. Some of those are the timing of certain events. We had some of those going against this in the first quarter around certain payments and things like that. So we can continue to manage through those throughout the year to help manage the overall operating cash flow that we have. So there's still opportunities there. We've talked about some CapEx, continuing to evaluate to make adjustments there. But by and large, we do look at our annual projection and we do need the industry to improve some back to that flattish level, if you will, for our fiscal year as part of our expectation.","Clarence Otis","From a cash flow perspective though, we have talked about what that point of comps is worth and it's roughly $30 million on what is roughly $1 billion annual operating cash. And so it's not a dramatic -- as dramatic a move at the operating cash level as it is at the reported earnings level.","Operator","Our last question, Andy Barish, Jefferies.","Andrew M. Barish - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Two quick ones. On the promotional stuff, I guess, how is -- with the price points relatively similar, how are you kind of really getting at affordability? Is it through sort of electronic, digital stuff that we're not necessarily seeing on TV? Can you sort of address that? And then just as a follow-up on operating margin guidance, I think it was down 60 to 80 bps. Is that essentially the same? And with the 2Q so skinny, it implies kind of a -- almost a flattish back half operating margin. Is that kind of what you're thinking still?","Clarence Otis","Yes, I would start on the first one and I'll hand it off to Drew but it's -- inside that price point, what's the quality of the particular product that you're offering? So consumers are very savvy. And so to the extent we have the same price but we have a better product, then that's going to put us in a better situation from an affordability perspective.","Andrew H. Madsen","Yes, and that's largely what I meant by saying we've elevated our promotional intensity. The price points are going to vary by brand, but we want to make sure that what we're offering within those constructs is distinctive and differentiated and compelling and high quality. I mean, that's ultimately the way we're going to win with those.","C. Bradford Richmond","And Andy, Brad here. On the margins, thanks for asking that. We are looking for roughly the same margin impact that we've talked about at 60 basis points, give or take a little bit, and maybe a little bit hard to see when you look at the first quarter. I'll go back to the comment I made earlier that our promotional approach that we had really took hold last year in our second fiscal quarter. And so the margin contraction that you've seen in the first quarter is not what you should be projecting for the remainder of the year. Your comment on doing the quick math is probably about right. The remainder of the year is -- may vary some by quarter, but roughly flat is what we're looking at because we're wrapping on a very similar comparison last year in our strategies.","Matthew Stroud","We'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning.

Thanks for joining us. We had a strong quarter with each of our brands, significantly outperforming the industry benchmarks as we continue to focus on improving our execution. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.6% with positive same-restaurant sales in each of our brands. It was a volatile quarter as a result of multiple holiday and calendar shifts, including Easter, Memorial Day and spring break vacations, which we believe negatively impacted comps across the industry.","Olive Garden had another great quarter and concluded a year in which we served more than 220 million guests. The Olive Garden brand is extremely relevant, the business is strong and our strategy continues to deliver results, as evidenced by our ongoing momentum.","In Q4, same-restaurant sales grew 2.4%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by more than 440 basis points in both sales and traffic. This was our seventh consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth and fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-restaurant guest counts.","Three key drivers of this performance include; first, further simplification of our operational processes and procedures leading to improved execution in our restaurants; second, culinary innovation that builds on the brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, as seen with our successful Italian Pot Pies, Mediterranean Fresh and Lasagna Lover promotions; and finally, continued growth of our successful OG To Go platform. To Go sales were up 19% year-over-year with a two-year growth rate over 40%. For the year, OG To Go sales represented 10.8% of total sales, an increase of 140 basis points versus last year.","Additionally, we had the best Mother's Day in Olive Garden history, which further demonstrates the brand's relevance and its broad appeal as a destination for family celebrating time together. Olive Garden remains laser focused on driving frequency of our loyal guests while delivering great experiences and our guests are responding positively. Our innovation pipeline is strong and we still have meaningful operations improvements to capture.","LongHorn Steakhouse maintained its solid top line momentum and once again delivered strong profit growth. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.2%, the 13th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by more than 400 basis points, and same-restaurant traffic was well above the industry average. We will continue to invest in food quality to enhance the overall perceived value of the dining experience and have multiple in-restaurant tests underway.","Additionally, LongHorn continues to simplify operations to strengthen in-restaurant execution and deliver great guest experiences. This focus on operational excellence is augmented by compelling non-price pointed promotions like our Big Bold Steaks and Longhorn Favorites that reinforce our steak expertise.","Looking at our specialty restaurants, all five businesses continued to deliver solid results that included positive same-restaurant sales growth at each, led by Seasons 52 at 5% and Bahama Breeze at 4.7%. Seasons 52 had another strong quarter. We continued to execute our strategy at a very high level and I'm impressed with what the team has been able to achieve throughout the year. Seasons 52 is an on-trend concept, giving guests the opportunity to enjoy handcrafted cuisine that is healthful without sacrificing the taste or style. We look forward to building on the momentum we have created as we rebuild the pipeline for value creating new restaurants.","Yard House represents a significant growth opportunity for us and during the quarter we named Mike Kneidinger President. I'm excited to have Mike lead the Yard House team and he is supported by an extremely strong team. Mike did a tremendous job leading Bahama Breeze delivering same-restaurant sales growth of 3.5% annually over the past three years and I'm confident he will build on the momentum at Yard House.","All of our specialty restaurants continue to perform well and are differentiated and well-positioned to grow market share into the future. Overall, I'm pleased with the results we achieved this quarter. And now I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss those in more detail.","Rick Cardenas","Thank you, Gene, and good morning everyone. Darden's fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.10, both on a reported and adjusted basis. They were 8.9% higher than last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. As a reminder, last year was a 14-week fiscal quarter. The 8.9% growth assumes a 13-week quarter last year. Additionally, this quarter we paid out over $63 million in dividends and repurchased approximately $45 million in Darden stock.","Key drivers of this quarter's growth included; positive same-restaurant sales of 1.7% on a fiscal basis; continued progress achieving our cost savings initiatives throughout the P&L; a favorable commodities environment resulting in approximately 1% deflation in food and beverage expense; and depreciation and interest expense savings related to the real estate transactions.","These results were partially offset by 170 basis points of incremental rent and other taxes related to the real estate transactions. Excluding the additional rent expense and other taxes, restaurant expenses would have been favorable by approximately 20 basis points. And while our adjusted tax rate was in line with the expectations we shared last quarter, tax expense as a percent of sales was 80 basis points unfavorable to last year, driven by tax timing.","Turning to segment performance, as a reminder, fiscal 2016 segment profit includes the incremental rent and other tax expense associated with the real estate transactions, whereas fiscal 2015 did not include these costs. In total, these costs were $30 million for the quarter. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings, which were $27 million, are not recognized in segment profit.","Olive Garden segment profit margin of 19.3% was 100 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 230 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding the incremental rent, Olive Garden segment profit margin was 130 basis points higher than last year.","LongHorn Steakhouse grew segment profit margin by 120 basis points for the quarter to 19%. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit increased 250 basis points at LongHorn. Our Fine Dining and Other Business segment profit margins were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis at 20.1% and 18.9%, respectively, with our Other Business segment impacted by additional rents.","We are pleased with the progress each of our segments has made improving profitability. They are leveraging their sales growth and continuing to improve the guest experience while taking advantage of Darden scale and working closely with our support teams to identify and capture cost savings.","Finally, as we announced this morning, our Board declared a $0.56 per share quarterly dividend, a 12% increase from last quarter's dividend. We were able to spin off our real estate into a separate publicly traded company and still increased our quarterly dividend above our pre-spin quarterly dividend. And our spin-off of real estate assets to Four Corners created additional growth for our shareholders as the current combined dividend of the new companies is now 23% higher than the Darden dividend before the spin-off of Four Corners this past November.","Fiscal 2016 was a year of significant progress at Darden. We achieved 4.4% total sales growth on a 52-week basis, 3.3% same-restaurant sales growth and 38% growth in adjusted diluted net earnings per share. In addition to meaningful sales and adjusted earnings per share growth, we profitably grew our market share exceeding the industry benchmark for same-restaurant sales by over 400 basis points, increased adjusted operating margins by over 200 basis points, leveraged our scale further optimizing our supply chain and managing costs resulting in $95 million in annual cost savings which exceeded our initial target, and returned more than $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Importantly, we also executed our real estate strategy by completing a tax free spin-off of select real estate assets and restaurant assets into a new public company, Four Corners Property Trust. This transaction advanced our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders, while improving our capital structure and reducing debt.","Using proceeds from this transaction and from the sale-leasebacks of our Restaurant Support Center and 64 restaurants plus cash on hand, we paid down $1 billion in debt during the year. This reduction in debt significantly improved our leverage resulting in a return to investment grade credit status from all three credit rating agencies. Overall, we are excited \u2013 we are executing a value creating business model to generate significant and durable cash flow that will fund growth and return capital to shareholders.","Now looking forward to fiscal 2017, we anticipate total sales growth of 1.7% to 2.7%, which includes same-restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and 24 to 28 new units, capital spending of between $310 million to $350 million, cost savings of approximately $30 million, total inflation between 1.5% and 2%, and annual effective tax rate between 26% and 27%, and approximately 128.5 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in earnings per diluted share between $3.80 and $3.90.","We anticipate first quarter earnings per share to have the highest growth on a percentage basis as we expect commodities deflation in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 while we forecast commodities inflation in subsequent quarters.","As a reminder, in December we shared our framework for value creation including a 7% to 10% earnings after tax growth and a 10% to 15% of total shareholder returns calculated as EPS growth plus dividend yield. The metrics for our fiscal 2017 outlook are within the long-term targets we shared this past December with the exception of new restaurant growth. We are working diligently to build the pipeline of new restaurants for future growth.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Gene.","Gene Lee","Thanks Rick. As I think about fiscal 2016, I'm extremely proud of the progress we made in pursuit of our mission, which is to be financially successful through great people, consistently delivering outstanding food, drinks and service and inviting atmosphere, making every guest loyal. Our results reinforce that our strategy is working as our restaurants and team members continue to build guest loyalty by relentlessly focusing on our back-to-basics operating philosophy, which is rooted in culinary innovation and execution, attentive service, engaging atmospheres and integrated marketing.","Finally, we continue to leverage our four competitive advantages that we see as key to unlocking sales growth and expanding margins. They are, the significant scale of our Company, the breadth and depth of our data and consumer insights, our commitment to rigorous strategic planning, and our results-oriented people culture. It's that last competitive advantage, our people, that truly sets our Company apart.","Together we have accomplished a great deal over the past two years and we've done it by getting a little better each day. It may sound simple but it's hard to consistently deliver outstanding guest experiences day in and day out. It only happens because of our 150,000 outstanding team members across our Company. So let me close by thanking each of them. We know we've got a lot more work to do but I'm confident our team is up to the challenge.","Now we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have our first question. It is coming from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brett Levy","Obviously another quarter of a nice job on the labor line. Can you do us a favor and talk a little bit through what your thoughts are and how you're managing labor, what you can do on given all of the scarcity that's out there how you're looking at inflation, and also have you had an opportunity to assess what kind of impact the changes to overtime will have to your labor line in the way you're approaching business?","Gene Lee","A couple of things. Let me deal the last point first, which is the labor impact. That will have no impact on our organization. Let me talk about labor. Labor is something that we continue to focus on but we are focusing on it in a different way and we are focusing on it on really when we think about menu development, how our menus are constructed and how that leads to processes and procedures in the kitchen. And we continue to focus on simplification in all aspects of what I would call the production process or the manufacturing process of producing our menu items.","Our teams are doing a great job of simplifying the processes and thinking about how products that we have are adding to the menu or we have on the menu impact the production process. And so we've taken products off the menu that are complex, we've simplified processes and procedures, which has allowed us to improve the overall productivity in the back-of-the-house. Obviously the front of the house is an area where it's kind of off-limits. We have our beliefs in what it takes to execute out front and we're focused on back-of-the-house.","We've also got a lot of energy around making sure that we have the appropriate labor in the restaurant at the right times. One of the things that we do with our P&L reviews at the end of each quarter is we sit down and we really look at what's the productivity of our restaurants before we have guests in there and then after we don't have guests in there, and we've been able to take a lot of hours out by making some adjustments there. So we feel like we're improving the guest experience. We are working on productivity in the back-of-the-house with the design of our menus and processes and procedures.","I'll close by saying, and maybe preempt some other questions on labor, is that labor market is tight and it continues to be tight in specific markets, which is driving a little bit more inflation. But as I've said many times on this call, I prefer to operate in an environment where labor is tight. I think that will lead to demand into the future.","Brett Levy","Would you be able to quantify what your wage rate inflation is or what you're seeing in terms of turnover?","Gene Lee","We're seeing 2.5% to 3.5% wage inflation depending on where we are, in which brand and which part of the country. We've not seen a major tick-up in any of our turnover. Actually, our turnover remained strong. We believe in our employment proposition. We're continuing to look at that and we provide our employees the tremendous opportunity for advancement. And so the industry hasn't seen a pretty good tick-up in turnover but we're not seeing it in our Darden brands.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is now open.","Brian Bittner","Question about the outlook for 2017. On the comp front, your 1% to 2% guidance is not the same as your 1% to 3% normalized outlook. I guess at the midpoint it's a little below and it is a little below where your trend was in May and for the fourth quarter. So what's driving just a slight bit more caution there, is it the current environment or is it the fact that you're lapping some pretty outsized comps? If you could just talk about how you constructed the comp outlook, I'd appreciate it.","Gene Lee","I think that what's involved in our outlook guidance of 1% to 2% is we're giving guidance for a very long period of time, over the next 12 months, and based on all the things that we know today and all that we don't know about the next 12 months, we think 1% to 2% is a prudent guide that would indicate that it's still significant outperformance over the industry. And so we believe that's the appropriate guidance at this point in time with all the knowledge that we have.","Brian Bittner","That makes a lot of sense, and it's pretty solid. On the EPS front, why are you guys guiding to a little higher share count year-over-year when you're also saying you're going to buy back $100 million to $200 million of stock. Is there that much dilution going on with stock-based compensation or what's going on there?","Rick Cardenas","This is Rick. A couple of things. There's just a lot of assumptions and factors that make up our share count, including dilution as you mentioned, option exercises, new equity grants which really aren't that different than last year, and share price, so the assumptions that we make for share price and the timing of our buyback. So we thought it was most prudent to just give you a share count number that we're using for our EPS, which we haven't done in the past.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Will Slabaugh of Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.","Billy Sherrill","It's actually Billy on for Will this morning. I was interested to hear what you're seeing from the consumer across your brand portfolio. Are you seeing different trends at some of your higher end dining relative to the lower end and what you think from your perspective is driving that behavior? Clearly we've heard many companies allude to a recent shift in consumer behavior but have you at Darden seen anything discernible or at least worth noting?","Gene Lee","No, I think the way I would talk about consumer behavior is that guest continues to look for value, and affordability is only one component of that value but it's not really enough to drive sustainable traffic growth. And so obviously in an Olive Garden, we serve a lot of different guests to get to 5,000 guests a week, and each guest is looking for something different, but whenever we find something that the consumer really believes has got value, that's where the consumer goes, and that's not always the lowest price point or the thing that's discounted the most. We still see a lot of guests in LongHorn just gravitate towards a great fillet because it's a great value. We saw a high preference in Olive Garden with seafood lasagna which caught us a little bit by surprise, but it was the best value in the offering that we had.","And so I believe the guest continues to look for value and the value equation is not always just what's in the numerator. When you think about \u2013 we think about our brands all the way from Olive Garden to Capital Grille, obviously price plays a lot more importance in creating that value in an Olive Garden, where in Capital Grille it's much more about how we make you feel that creates the value in that experience.","And so we think about it and go along that line in between Olive Garden and Capital Grille. We're looking for that real value differentiator that will drive traffic. And sometimes it's affordability and price and sometimes it's more some of the other attributes and we keep pulling on all of the attributes, not just one, and we continue to make improvements in quality, we continue to make improvements in service. That's why we focus so much on execution. We believe at the end of the day we got to execute at what we call the 9 square feet, at that table in every one of our restaurants one table at a time. That really drives the most value to the consumer.","Overall, their behavior continues to be same. We see them still using the full menu. If we've got good interesting appetizers, they are buying. If we've got good interesting desserts, they are buying them. And so it's compelling for us to keep coming up with great culinary innovation that make people want to buy our products.","Billy Sherrill","Got it. Thanks. It's actually very helpful. And then one real quick follow-up if I could with regards to the off-premise and To Go sales, A, what do you think has been the biggest contribution from the Company's part in driving the growth and I guess kind of assimilating to that platform, and then second, would you by any chance be willing to kind of breakout what you believe the contribution from the online sales were to this quarter's comp?","Gene Lee","Let me address the first part of that question. I think we identified four or five years ago that the [indiscernible] convenience was going to continue to grow, and that's the one thing that consumer was telling us in the insights was that we don't have enough time to do all the things that we want to do, we want you to make this more convenient for us. And so we built the platform that enabled us to do that.","We've been able to market it effectively, we've been able to deliver it in different ways whether it's through a traditional to-go experience, whether it's through an online ordering experience, whether it's through bulk. And now with this delivery and catering that we are doing, we're just giving the consumer another access point to get what they want, which is something that's convenient, that's high quality and a great value. And that's why I think take-out is working. We've got a brand that's meeting that consumer where the consumer wants to be met. Do we have on the percentage? About 20% of our business today is online and that continues to grow each quarter.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Matthew DiFrisco","Before I get to my question, I just wondered, can you elaborate a little bit more on what you consider online? Is that an online reservation or are you saying that 20% of the people are actually paying online?","Gene Lee","No, 20% of the people are ordering take-out online. That's a big point of focus for us because the more we convert, we [indiscernible] when we have a higher check, but operationally it's much easier when we get that order online.","Matthew DiFrisco","And how much is online in aggregate right now?","Gene Lee","20%.","Matthew DiFrisco","No, overall how much of your business at Olive Garden is take-out, 20%?","Rick Cardenas","No, 10.8%.","Matthew DiFrisco","Got it. And then 20% of that 10.8% is online?","Rick Cardenas","Yes.","Matthew DiFrisco","Understood, okay. My questions as far as the gap to your NAP appears, you accelerated and even widened that towards the end of the quarter in what it appears to be the month of May. I know obviously your calendar NAP has a different period somewhat, so maybe it's not a perfect science, but both brands seem to have accelerated in the back half of your fiscal quarter. I wondered if you could elaborate on maybe some of the promotional activity or something that you saw competitively that really lidded up in the back half of the quarter. And my follow-up question would be, you did comment that the commodity environment suggested the EPS in the first half of fiscal 2017 would probably drive greater earnings growth. Is that the same for the same sort of sales front as far as what we saw in the month of May, are we carrying greater momentum? And looking at the compares, it would suggest probably that the first half also will be a comp stronger period than the back half.","Gene Lee","Let me deal with the second part of your question. We're not going to comment on sales trends in June and I don't think you should make that leap. I think you should look at the same restaurant sales as 1 or 2 as pretty flat throughout the year, based on what we know right now.","And as far as May goes, you are correct, we did accelerate against the industry in May. I think that we focused a lot on Mother's Day and in and around Mother's Day which gave us a great boost. As I said, Olive Garden had a record Mother's Day, LongHorn had a \u2013 every one of our brands had a record Mother's Day and the days around Mother's Day as we really focused and we think that drove a lot of the activity in the month.","We really have liked focusing on these days, both from a communication standpoint but also from an operational standpoint. When you look at a Mother's Day in both OG and LongHorn, it's just about how many guests you can get through and execute perfectly throughout the day.","And so I think we were active both digitally and other promotional activity and we executed extremely well. We also got a big bump in catering and delivery for Mother's Day in OG, which was a strong bump. So I think it was our teams did a great job. We capitalized on the volume when the volume was there.","Operator","Our next question is coming from David Palmer of RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","David Palmer","If you were to audit the sales drivers at Olive Garden for 2016 through renovation, LTOs, the value platforms, To Go, what were the biggest drivers in your opinion for the year, whether you want to put numbers on it or not? And how do you think about contributors going into 2017, do you have a sense of how differently the sales drivers will shape up this next fiscal year?","Gene Lee","I think there's a few. First, I want to start with, I think we are executing better and I know sometimes we want to look for some other things but I want to pivot back to I think Dave George and Danielle Kirgan, the team at Olive Garden have just done a great job improving the day to day executions. I think that's been the number one sales driver. And as I said in my comments, we think we still have meaningful improvement to make there.","Second, we think To Go has been a great sales driver. This has been a leader in what we've been doing. We think we're exposing more guests to Olive Garden. It's been a terrific sales driver. We've done great culinary innovation. We've hit some really big products. Our pot pies were a big hit, our culinary tour was a big hit, our Create Your Own Tour of Italy has been a big hit.","Ziosk has been a sales driver. So it's been a good lever that we don't think that we've fully hit full stride with that. We've still got some room there. And then remodels have been a solid sales driver outperforming the base by almost 4% in traffic, 3% or 4% in traffic.","So I feel like there's multiple levers but I want to wrap that back around with our maniacal focus on trying to execute better at the restaurant. We as a team, and me especially, believe that is the key driver of winning in this business, is that interaction between a server and the guest. If we don't win there, all the other things are \u2013 I don't want to say they are meaningless but they are close. We've got to execute at a very high level and congratulations to all the Olive Garden people who are listening out there, you did a great, great job.","Operator","Our next question is coming from David Tarantino of Baird. Your line is now open.","David Tarantino","I have a question about the 2017 margin guidance. It looks like you're assuming margin improvement in line with your long-run targets, but I think you also should be seeing some carryover benefits and new benefits from some of the cost savings that you've achieved. So my question is, is there something offsetting the cost savings from an investment perspective that's preventing the margin expansion from being above the range you normally would expect going forward?","Rick Cardenas","David, there's a couple of things. I would say, one, we have the second half of the real estate that we have to wrap on. So real estate primarily offsets the $30 million of cost saves that we talked about for next year. And if we get cost savings greater than that, we're going to continue to reinvest in our business to drive sales growth. So while we are still in our long-term framework, again the real estate transaction and the rents, et cetera, are offsetting our cost saves.","David Tarantino","Great, that's helpful. And then one more clarification on the guidance, on the comps outlook, can you give us a sense of what the breakdown in the comps might look like from a check and traffic standpoint or at least what you're assuming at this stage?","Rick Cardenas","What we're assuming David is we're going to be at the low end of our 1% to 2% pricing in next year, and so we do assume some traffic growth in our guidance.","Operator","Our next question is coming from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","John Glass","I wanted to go back to the 1% to 2% outlook for next year as well. It is a little lower than your 1% to 3%. One, what is your assumption on the industry, is this just that industry generated slower, so maybe you could be more explicit about that? And I think you've been a little bit more restrained around pricing. Do you think price value is becoming a bigger issue in the industry and that's why you are being more restrained on that as well?","Gene Lee","I think that's a great question. As Rick said, we're right now at the lower end on a pricing thinking is that we're going to be in the 1% kind of range depending on the business, but we definitely think Olive Garden can't be more than 1% in the current environment. We're looking at an industry last year that was down 1.3% but trending \u2013 I'm sorry, that was the quarter \u2013 we're looking at an industry that was down closer to almost 2% or high 1s. We're working off that number. And so we're looking at a meaningful outperformance with minimal price as we continue to try to improve the value offerings in our businesses. We need to continue to invest.","There is a lot of talk about how promotional the environment is right now, but the facts are the industry still charging the guest 2 plus percent more than they did last year for the experience, and we believe that 2017 with what we know right now is the year to invest, continue to invest back into the guest experience to continue to grow market share. And we believe if the overall industry was to improve, then I think, we think we would improve also, but based on the current trends and what's happened in the last couple of years, we think this is the right way to head into fiscal 2017.","John Glass","And just a follow-up, on LongHorn, do you think the shift in promotional activity is hurting sales there? I understand you're still outperforming, but the sales are lower and traffic is now negative. Is that shift in promotion partly to blame for that or not?","Gene Lee","I think that's only half the question. I think you have to go to the P&L and look at how much more money that we are making. What we're doing right now is, through our data and insights we identified that there were certain guests in the LongHorn system that we were losing money on, and it was obvious to us, and Rick's team did an outstanding job and we've backed off trying to attract those guests into the restaurant. I'm saying, if we can't make money on the guest taking up the table on a Saturday night, we're not going to push to bring them in. So there are few guests that are slipping out that were in our base last year but they weren't profitable.","I'm incredibly impressed with the margin improvement and the progress that we're making with LongHorn. The team has done an outstanding job and I'm not as concerned about where we are from a traffic standpoint. This model is starting to get back to work the way the model was designed to work many, many years ago and I'm super-excited about the trajectory of this business, especially when I look at where the sales are and the margins.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jason West of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jason West","Couple of questions. One, I guess, Gene, you have a probably better visibility than we do on the industry trends, in other words, the end of June, we had been seeing some slight improvement in May for the industry as you talked about moving away from the Easter shift, have you seen the industry kind of give that back a bit in June, is that part of the caution that you're referring to?","Gene Lee","I really don't want to comment on June. You guys have access to different benchmarks. At this point I want to talk about fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 and we're not going to talk about what's happening in the industry in June.","Jason West","Okay. And then a separate question, on the savings outlook, I think you said $30 million baked into the guidance. I think the original target for 2017 was $30 million to $40 million and maybe there was some hope that as you're still digging through the business lines that you'll find some additional savings. So would you say the $30 million is conservative and you're still sort of looking for other opportunities or have you kind of tapped out what you can do there?","Rick Cardenas","Couple of things, Jason. One, we got a little bit more of the savings in the fourth quarter of this year. So that was $5 million more than we had originally anticipated. So that gets you to $30 million to $35 million. We've just made the decision that we are going to invest some of those savings. So if we find over $30 million, we are going to reinvest in our business. So we're going to continue to look for cost savings where it makes sense, where it doesn't impact the guest experience and use those cost savings to continue to improve the value equation at all of our brands, especially at Olive Garden. So $30 million is where we think we are. I'm not saying it's conservative, I'm saying that's where we're going to be net, and if we find more, we'll probably reinvest it.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Jeff Farmer","Just to follow up on share purchase and free cash flow, couple of different questions there, so delivered a second year of almost $600 million in free cash in 2016 and I'm just curious why you were not more aggressive with putting some of that to work in terms of share repurchase?","Gene Lee","A couple of things, Jeff. One is, we've given you the long-term framework of $100 million to $200 million of share repurchase. We have $500 million of share repurchase that the Board has authorized. We have $315 million left in that. We'll continue to find opportunities and work with our Board to understand the best uses of our cash going forward, but the share repurchase we have is within our long-term framework.","Jeff Farmer","Okay. And then just sort of to beat the horse on this one, so FY 2017, similar setup, you guys are going to raise your CapEx by about $100 million with still about $0.5 billion free cash. So it still seems like a similar nice problem to have. You're just throwing off a ton of free cash. So again I would be curious about the repurchase, but then also you just alluded to the best uses, what else is out there, what are you guys considering other than potentially modestly accelerating unit growth, remodels, returning cash to shareholders through the form of repo, what else is the Board thinking about?","Gene Lee","This is Gene. We're constantly in constant communication with our Board about what's the best thing for us to do as we move forward. We'll continue to look at all the alternatives available to us with our excess cash, our capital structure, and we'll continue to make the prudent decisions to invest in the business long-term and we'll evaluate what the opportunities are every quarter. We just finished our year-end Board meeting and we'll get back together in September and we'll evaluate the opportunities that are available to us at that time. You alluded to this as a good opportunity for us and we'll continue to evaluate and make the right decisions, but at this point in time we have no further comments.","Jeff Farmer","Okay, just one other technical question. So certain shareholders exiting the Company over the last several months and I was just curious if that in any way ties your hands from a regulatory standpoint in terms of being more aggressive with share repurchase?","Gene Lee","No.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Chris O'Cull of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Chris O'Cull","Gene, many restaurants are talking about retooling or changing their value platforms or message because they believe that their message is stale, but do you feel Olive Garden needs to alter or enhance its everyday value platform at all?","Gene Lee","I think what we need to focus in on Olive Garden, without talking too much directly to our competitors right now, is continuing to expand the offerings between $10 and $15. We've got the $9.99 platform which really anchors ourselves at dinner, we have the $6.99 at lunch, but we're looking for different ways to deliver value somewhere in that $10 to $15 range to give the consumer just a few more options, and we think we have the innovation to do that.","And so we'll continue to focus on that, but back to a statement I made earlier, we're just as focused on other components of value than we are just on price, and Dave and the team are really working on other ways to provide value for the guests. So let me give an example of that.","One thing about an Olive Garden where we see the value perceptions go down is how long the people have to wait to come into our restaurant. So what can we do while they are on their way to improve that process? We're starting to play with and test a few things, and if we do it correctly, we actually improve the overall value experience without changing anything else on the menu or pricing.","And so we've got to continue to focus on the other components of value where we talk about other components in the numerator and just not focus on what's on the denominator of the value equation. And so we do need to work at certain price points but we do need to execute some of those other variables.","Chris O'Cull","Rick, you mentioned commodity inflation as to the first quarter. Is that based on known contract prices or just your anticipation commodities will start to inflate again?","Rick Cardenas","So, Chris, we've got about 60% of our coverage for the first half of the year. So we're keeping open in some places, but we're just making the forecast that commodities are going to increase in the back half of the year, on inflation on the commodities. So it depends on when you buy as well. So, we've got just slight commodity inflation in the back half of the year.","Chris O'Cull","Is beef a part of that contract you already have for the\u2026?","Rick Cardenas","Beef, is beef part of the contract? Yes, we're pretty open in the back half of the year on beef. So we've got, as I said, 60% of our total commodities covered in the first half but 45% of that is beef.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jeff Bernstein","Just two questions. One, following up on the balance sheet discussion before and specifically around maybe leverage, it does seem like the industry is ramping up often with the help I guess from franchising or I should say refranchising, which is contrary to Darden which has been paying down, I think you mentioned $1 billion this year, but post the real estate spin and you got the upgrade to the investment-grade, so I'm just wondering maybe you can give an outlook on both fronts, both debt, for your target debt levels and the potential for any refranchising? I think in the past you've mentioned maybe a LongHorn opportunity, but just wondering how you think about that leverage opportunity relative to the conservative level today.","Gene Lee","As we've said before, our first priority is to maintain our investment-grade profile and we just were upgraded by all three agencies in the fourth quarter. We think that's great news. Our targeted debt coverage is 2x to 2.5x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, and right now we're at the very low end of that range, and we continue to say we're going to be within that range and we'll continue to demonstrate sound fiscal policy. We're not going to talk much about franchising going forward, but just the 2 to 2.5 is where we expect to be.","Jeff Bernstein","Got you. And then just the comment you guys made I think on the unit growth, I guess that was where you were going to fall short potentially in fiscal 2017, at the end of slides you breakout unit growth by brand in terms of expectation. So I was wondering if you can offer a little color again being below your target level. It seemed like Olive Garden and LongHorn are the two brands that are still carrying it in 2017 whereas the other brands that are all doing quite well there's very modest growth. So I'm wondering your outlook for Olive Garden perhaps in future years, whether that's a number that goes up or whether you would expect some of the other brands to start to ramp things up based on their strong performance?","Gene Lee","Good question, Jeff. When you turn the development pipeline off, it's pretty difficult to turn it back on. And so we're in the process of turning the development pipeline back on. It's easier and your results come quicker in your casual dining brands, your Olive Garden and your LongHorns. Our specialty brands, it's a longer lead time from a development standpoint. And so we would look for the smaller brands to actually pick up and make up that differential in the gap. We need Yard House to grow at 8% to 10%, we need Seasons to grow at 5% to 8% into the future. We are very pleased with what's going on with Breeze. We need them to \u2013 we're making some commitments there.","I would just say, this is just a function of the lead time of the specialty brands and the kind of properties that we need. We're working diligently. We've got the whole development function working on getting us and making sure that we're in range in fiscal 2018.","Jeff Bernstein","Understood. And just to clarify the comment earlier about May comps seeing an improvement, I think you said big focus on Mother's Day and otherwise. Was there any shift from a Memorial Day perspective? I know you had said earlier on the call that maybe there was some few different shifts and that hurt you guys. So I'm just wondering Memorial Day specifically in May might have helped.","Gene Lee","Memorial Day for the fiscal and the calendar really kind of offset each other. So Memorial Day wasn't really that big of an impact for us.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Karen Holthouse","So another question on the labor line, if you look at it, it seems like your wage inflation outlook has ticked up a little bit from how you were talking about that taking then price down a little bit, cost cuts are slowing. Would the expectation be that you can still leverage the labor line on an overall basis or is it something where we might actually see a little bit of deleverage this year?","Gene Lee","I think that we're going to probably not going to see a whole lot of leverage there unless we get outside our sales range. I think that we'll continue to search for our productivity enhancements in the back of the house through our processes and procedures and we'll continue to manage wage rates effectively. We're also going to continue to evaluate how do we improve our overall employment proposition so that we have other ways to attract employees, not just through paying them more in salary. So overall, I think we're looking at this right now to try to hold labor flat throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Andy Barish of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Andrew Barish","Just two quick ones on any daypart commentary or differences, particularly in the Olive Garden business, and then also on Olive Garden where you stand for fiscal 2017 remodels, both as you look at the bars as well as the full remodels?","Gene Lee","We're seeing no difference in dayparts, Andy. In Olive Garden, there's a little bit of fluctuation depending on what we're doing and what we did the year before, but overall, when you really look at it on a trailing trend, there's not a lot of noise there. As far as remodels, we're going to do 62 full remodels in 2017 and we've got 155 planned bar refreshes. And just to remind everybody, that's when we go in and we take these bars that don't have very comfortable seating and we put in very comfortable seating, we add TVs, and basically we turn these bar areas that aren't very productive today into productive dining seats, and we're seeing a very small lift, $20,000 or $25,000 investment, and it's more than paying for itself, and it's just, when we go in and do the full remodel and the bar is done, that just means the bar is done and we're not to touch it.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Sara Senatore","Just a couple of follow-up questions, the first on LongHorn, I think you had been saying now for a couple of quarters now that it's a very deliberate decision to try to look at who is profitable in your customer base, but that I think in part you had thought that as you may be, as some of those less profitable customers leave, it makes room for more profitable customers and the higher-margin customers who are not turned away by the lines or the capacity restaurants. But I guess given the traffic is negative, is it going to take a while for that to happen, because it seems like the less profitable customers are leaving but you're not bringing in some of these more profitable customers that I had thought you had in mind who would sort of fill the gap. So I guess I'm just trying to understand the dynamic over the next couple of quarters when that might happen. So that's the LongHorn question and then I do have another follow-up on Olive Garden please.","Gene Lee","Okay. When we think about LongHorn \u2013 let's start \u2013 we're still from a guest count basis still 200 basis points above the industry. So we're still taking market share from a guest count standpoint. I think that's in itself very impressive when you look at the rest of the competitive set. We are continuing to make improvements that are going to take quality improvements \u2013 that are going to take time to show through to the guests. We've done some things when the price of beef was increasing that I think hurt the business, but just by changing and we're going back to them tomorrow doesn't mean a guest is going to come the next day. It's going to take time for our guests to come through and have a different experience and grow the business.","And so when I look at this business, and this is the one that I am personally the most familiar with, this is a business that has been underperforming from a profitability standpoint and has been run a little differently over the years than I think it should have been run and now we're running it back. This has never been a business that needed a lot of high guest counts to achieve its profitability. These are small boxes. They are designed to put out a strong profitable return, and then when that business building gets full, you build another building 4 miles down the road. And you look at how this business is really set up in Atlanta where we have 45 restaurants. There's no one in dining, casual dining, that comes close to having the kind of penetration we have with this strategy that we put in place there.","And so we are back to building smaller restaurants and focused on ensuring that we are getting the right profitability from those units. We are going to make strategic choices to improve the overall quality of the experience. It's going to take time for those things to get into the consumer, for the consumer to see those, and then start improving their frequency or reaching other guests that we weren't reaching because of our advertising and how we were talking about the brand.","And so I'm really confident directionally about where we are going and this business is contributing now at a much more, at a level that's I think appropriate where it has under-contributed. Even though it was growing sales all these quarters, it wasn't making any money.","Sara Senatore","And then just on Olive Garden, you had mentioned meaningful operations improvement you can still capture. Can you talk about what that looks like and is that more about top line or efficiency around the cost line? Just as I think about all that you've done so far, there's been a lot of, a tremendous amount of change it feels like at Olive Garden. So I'm just trying to understand maybe what's left in terms of a driver of the business going forward.","Gene Lee","When I think about meaningful, I think about it on a few different dimensions, but first, I think that we still break down too many times in Olive Garden where somewhere in the service experience we have a deficiency, whether it's the timing wasn't right, the server didn't get to the table at the right time, the food didn't come out right. When you're talking about the number of guests that we serve, improving that by 1% or 2% has a significant impact on improving our same-restaurant sales. And so we think about just consistently delivering a better experience. I think that's the number one opportunity for us.","We've still got room to improve on production and menu simplification. Some of the recipes are still complex and Dave and the team are thinking about it every day, how do I make that less complex to be able to deliver that to the consumer? There's labor productivity opportunities. We still, in a system the size of Olive Garden, we can see in our own data we have opportunities for certain restaurants to improve food productivity. Sometimes, and what the team has done a really great job was, they just haven't gone to the lower volume restaurants. Some of the time, the opportunity, the most opportunity we have within our higher-volume restaurants.","And so they are developing ways to analyze and really discern where are my real opportunities to improve productivity. There are some controllable costs and management of controllable costs that still we have people that don't perform at the same level as others. So there's executional opportunity there. And then lastly, we still think we can execute To Go better and we think that that's a huge opportunity for us. As well as we're doing, we believe there's an opportunity to improve that even further.","Sara Senatore","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Andrew Strelzik","Just had a bigger picture question on to-go and delivery. We're hearing a number of concepts across the industry talk about focusing on delivery and to-go and putting up very nice growth rates like yourselves. So I'm wondering, over the next couple of years how you're thinking that this plays out. I mean is this a kind of rising tide lifts all boats type of equation where we are giving guest something that they've been looking for and so broadly this was going to work, or is there something specific to Darden, and where do you think those eating occasions are coming from, is it all coming from eating at home or how do you think this plays out over time?","Gene Lee","Good question. I do think there's an opportunity for everybody in the industry to capture this. Where we believe that Olive Garden is better situated is the kind of food that we serve. And so, if you are Bar & Grill, it's not like you can put 20 hamburgers in a container and send the rolls home and have them put everything together and still have a quality product, but we can send at home pans of lasagne, pans of chicken parmesan. I think the style of food that we serve really lends itself to this trend that's taking place. And so I think at Olive Garden we are better situated.","We're seeing to-go sales increase in LongHorn but we don't believe \u2013 we need to go with what the consumer wants there but we don't believe we have a platform to really in LongHorn with the style of food to be able to push that to a 20% of our overall business, where we think that it's something that Olive Garden has a real capability.","Third-party delivery is something that's going to evolve, that's going to affect the overall industry, and there are a lot of big names out there trying to figure out how they are going to come up with a solution to solve this problem, and I would say that's a stay tuned because there's just a lot of activity there with the big one but there's a lot of dollars for our Company. And I won't mention any names, if they can come up with a solution for us and for a casual dining and Olive dining, there's some money to be made there.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Steve Anderson of Maxim Group. Your line is now open.","Stephen Anderson","Embedded in your guidance, what number are you looking at for interest expense for the full year?","Rick Cardenas","For interest expense for the year, so we've got another reduction of \u2013 interest about $45 million I think for the year, which means it's $26 million less next year than it was this year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Joshua Long of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Joshua Long","My question was on the technology update and just really the technology opportunity. You mentioned that Ziosk has already been a sales driver for you. So I was curious, just in kind of what capacity or what inning you think you are in terms of being able to turn on those features? You have it rolled out to the restaurants, so I'm sure you're still going through and learning how to use it not only from a guest perspective but maybe there might be an opportunity for it to help with labor-management or things in back-of-the-house that the guests doesn't see. So just curious on where you are with that update and kind of what the opportunities might be to layer on additional features going forward in 2017 and beyond?","Gene Lee","Sure. So we haven't wrapped yet on our implementation of Ziosk. So we still have a little bit to go and a lot more training to do to teach the servers and the teams how to use that most effectively to improve the service experience for the guests. As we've said, the benefit of that device isn't \u2013 we're not expecting to take labor out of the system because of the device. We expect to continue to increase sales. We get a lot of data from our guests. Many more of them are filling out the surveys, so we learn a lot more. And it actually improves the biggest pain point that a guest has, is paying at the table.","So we believe that we're still early stages of getting all of the benefits from the Ziosk device that we can get, as we build on other things from that device. Again, nothing in the back-of-the-house that would be saved from that. We're thinking about looking at loyalty and how do we use loyalty with Ziosk, but we're still in the very early stages of that as well. But we're learning some things that we can use to use that for training and other things. So, still a long way to go there but we feel really good about where we are.","Joshua Long","That's helpful. Thank you. How much of the system has Ziosk or maybe at Olive Garden has Ziosk right now and kind of what's the expected rollout for 2017?","Gene Lee","At Olive Garden, 100% of the system has Ziosk. We're looking at it to see if it makes sense in other brands, but right now Olive Garden is the brand that we're focusing most on for the Ziosk.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Jake Bartlett","The question just is on delivery. In the last quarter you talked about how much it contributed to comps. I'm wondering how much it contributed in the fourth quarter as well as maybe what we should expect in 2017.","Rick Cardenas","Delivery was not a very big part of our overall To-Go. So we just actually launched, rolled out catering delivery, just about a week ago, and seeing some pretty good results there. But again, the delivery part of our \u2013 I'm sorry, the online catering, I'm sorry \u2013 online catering, seeing some good results there, but delivery isn't a tremendous part of our To-Go business. It's still growing.","Jake Bartlett","Actually I meant catering.","Rick Cardenas","Catering, okay, that's what I thought. Catering is about 25% of our overall To Go, and not all of that is delivery. So when we talk about catering, it also means people can come in and get a big order and take it with them.","Jake Bartlett","Okay. And then in 2017, I mean is there any reason we shouldn't expect To-Go to continue to grow at this rate and kind of have the similar contribution to comps?","Gene Lee","I can say that we launched To Go Online two years ago in July and we saw a 20% increase in the first year and 20% increase in the second year. I can't tell you that we'll see 20% increase in the third year. However, we continue to improve our To Go experience and convenience is a big driver of our To Go experience.","I will say on the catering side, the deliveries that we are doing, we're getting almost 100% of the people saying that they are going to reorder, they're going to do this again. So as that becomes bigger and bigger, it will become a bigger and bigger part of our pie. So we would continue to expect delivery and catering and To Go to grow for us. And I think we have said in the past that we expect To Go to be in the long run 20% of our business.","Jake Bartlett","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","I see no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak.","Kevin Kalicak","Thank you, Mandy. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind everyone that we expect to release our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter results on Tuesday, October 4 before the market opens \u2013 excuse me, that's first quarter fiscal 2017 results, with the conference call to follow on. Thank you for participating in today's call.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time."]}}
